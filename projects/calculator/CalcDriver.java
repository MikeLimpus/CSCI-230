/**
 * Jonathan Limpus
 * Programming Project 1: Parsing Strings/Calculator
 * 
 * Write a Java program that can simulate a simple calculator, 
 * using the Java console as the exclusive input and output device. 
 * That is, each input to the calculator, be it a number, like 12.34 
 * or 1034, or an operator, like + or =, can be done on a separate 
 * line. After each such input, you should output to the Java console 
 * what would be displayed on your calculator. Implement at least the 
 * following operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Modulus,
 * Exponentiation and Square Root and the use of parentheses for grouping. 
 * Your program should thrown an exception if the expression is invalid.
