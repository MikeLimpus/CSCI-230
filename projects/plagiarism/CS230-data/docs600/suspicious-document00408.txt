DAVID
It was always my dream to play it first to the new immigrants--those who
have known the pain of the old world and the hope of the new.

PAPPELMEISTER
Try it on the dog. _Was?_

DAVID
Yes--on the dog that here will become a man!

PAPPELMEISTER [_Shakes his head_]
I fear neider dogs nor men are a musical breed.

DAVID
The immigrants will not understand my music with their brains or their
ears, but with their hearts and their souls.

VERA
Well, then, why shouldn't it be done here--on our Roof-Garden?

DAVID [_Jumping up_]
A _Bas-Kôl_! A _Bas-Kôl_!

VERA
What _are_ you talking?

DAVID
Hebrew! It means a voice from heaven.

VERA
Ah, but will Herr Pappelmeister consent?

PAPPELMEISTER [_Bowing_]
Who can disobey a voice from heaven?... But ven?

VERA
On some holiday evening.... (You can make a square or a circle or a sort of hollow tower.)

Pour your rum over them till
they are well soaked. Then pour over them, or into the middle of the
biscuits, a vanilla cream like the foregoing
     recipe, but let it be nearly cold before you use it.
Decorate the top with the whites of four eggs sweetened and beaten,
or use fresh cream in the same way.

[_Mme. Spinette_.]

PINEAPPLE À L'ANVERS

Take some slices of pineapple, and cut off the brown spots at the
edges.
Steep them for three hours in a plateful of weak kirsch, or maraschino,
that is slightly warmed.

Cut
some slices of plain cake of equal thickness, and glaze them.

This is done
by sprinkling sugar over the slices and placing them in a gentle
oven.

The sugar melts
and leaves the slices _glacés_.

Arrange the slices in a
circle, alternating pineapple and cake, and
     pour over the latter an apricot
marmalade thinned with kirsch or other liqueur. This dish
     looks very nice, and
if whipped cream
     can be
added it is excellent.

[_L. L. B. Anvers_.]

POUDING AUX POMMES

Take a pound of
apples and peel them.

Cook them, and rub them, when soft,
through a sieve to make them into a purée.

Sweeten
it well,
     and scent it with a scrap of vanilla; then
let it get cold.

Beat up three
eggs, both whites and yolks, and mix them into your cold compôte, and
put all
     in a dish that will stand the heat of the oven.

Then place on the top a bit
of butter the size of a filbert and powder all over with white
sugar.

Place
the dish in an oven with a gentle heat for half-an-hour, watching
how it cooks.

This
dish can be eaten hot or cold.

[_E.
Defouck_.]

SOUFFLÉ AU CHOCOLAT

Melt
two tablets of chocolate (Menier) in a dessert-spoonful of water
over heat, stirring till the chocolate is well wetted and very thick.

Then
prepare some feculina flour in the following way: Take for five
or six persons nearly a pint of milk.

Sweeten
it well with sugar; take two dessert-spoonfuls of feculina.

Boil the sweetened
milk, flavoring it with a few drops of vanilla essence.

DAVID
What a question!

VERA
And you don't think wholly of your music and forget me?

DAVID
Why, you are behind all I write and play!

VERA [_With jealous passion_]
Behind? But I want to be before! I want you to love me first, before
everything.

DAVID
I do put you before everything.

VERA
You are sure? And nothing shall part us?

DAVID
Not all the seven seas could part you and me.

VERA
And you won't grow tired of me--not even when you are world-famous----?

DAVID [_A shade petulant_]
Sweetheart, considering I should owe it all to you----

VERA [_Drawing his head down to her breast_]
Oh, David! David! Don't be angry with poor little Vera if she doubts, if
she wants to feel quite sure. You see father has talked so terribly, and
after all I was brought up in the Greek Church, and we oughtn't to cause
all this suffering unless----

DAVID
Those who love us _must_ suffer, and _we_ must suffer in their
suffering. It is live things, not dead metals, that are being melted in
the Crucible.

VERA
Still, we ought to soften the suffering as much as----

DAVID
Yes, but only Time can heal it.

VERA [_With transition to happiness_]
But father seems half-reconciled already! Dear little father, if only he
were not so narrow about Holy Russia!

DAVID
If only _my_ folks were not so narrow about Holy Judea! But the ideals
of the fathers shall not be foisted on the children. Each generation
must live and die for its own dream.

VERA
Yes, David, yes. You are the prophet of the living present. I am so
happy.
     [_She looks up wistfully._]
You are happy, too?

DAVID
I am dazed--I cannot realise that all our troubles have melted away--it
is so sudden.

VERA
You, David? Who always see everything in such rosy colours? Now that the
whole horizon is one great splendid rose, you almost seem as if gazing
out toward a blackness----

DAVID
We Jews are cheerful in gloom, mistrustful in joy. It is our tragic
history----

VERA
But you have come to end the tragic history; to throw off the coils of
the centuries.

DAVID [_Smiling again_]
Yes, yes, Vera. You bring back my sunnier self. I must be a pioneer on
the lost road of happiness. To-day shall be all joy, all lyric ecstasy.
     [_He takes up his violin._]
Yes, I will make my old fiddle-strings _burst_ with joy!
     [_He dashes into a jubilant tarantella. After a few bars there is
     a knock at the door leading from the hall; their happy faces
     betray no sign of hearing it; then the door slightly opens, and
     BARON REVENDAL'S head looks hesitatingly in. As DAVID perceives
     it, his features work convulsively, his string breaks with a
     tragic snap, and he totters backward into VERA'S arms. Hoarsely_]
The face! The face!

VERA
David--my dearest!

DAVID [_His eyes closed, his violin clasped mechanically_]
Don't be anxious--I shall be better soon--I oughtn't to have talked
about it--the hallucination has never been so complete.

VERA
Don't speak--rest against Vera's heart--till it has passed away.
     [_The BARON comes dazedly forward, half with a shocked sense of
     VERA'S impropriety, half to relieve her of her burden. She
     motions him back._]
This is the work of your Holy Russia.

BARON [_Harshly_]
What is the matter with him?
     [_DAVID'S violin and bow drop from his grasp and fall on the
     table._]

DAVID
The voice!
     [_He opens his eyes, stares frenziedly at the BARON, then
     struggles out of VERA'S arms._]

VERA [_Trying to stop him_]
Dearest----

DAVID
Let me go.
     [_He moves like a sleep-walker toward the paralysed BARON, puts
     out his hand, and testingly touches the face._]

BARON [_Shuddering back_]
Hands off!

DAVID [_With a great cry_]
A-a-a-h! It is flesh and blood. No, it is stone--the man of stone!
Monster!
     [_He raises his hand frenziedly._]

BARON [_Whipping out his pistol_]
Back, dog!
     [_VERA darts between them with a shriek._]

DAVID [_Frozen again, surveying the pistol stonily_]
Ha! You want _my_ life, too. Is the cry not yet loud enough?

BARON
The cry?

DAVID [_Mystically_]
Can you not hear it? The voice of the blood of my brothers crying out
against you from the ground? Oh, how can you bear not to turn that
pistol against yourself and execute upon yourself the justice which
Russia denies you?

BARON
Tush!
     [_Pocketing the pistol a little shamefacedly._]

VERA
Justice on himself? For what?

DAVID
For crimes beyond human penalty, for obscenities beyond human utterance,
for----

VERA
You are raving.

DAVID
Would to heaven I were!

VERA
But this is my father.

DAVID
Your father!... God!
     [_He staggers._]

BARON [_Drawing her to him_]
Come, Vera, I told you----

VERA [_Frantically, shrinking back_]
Don't touch me!

BARON [_Starting back in amaze_]
Vera!

VERA [_Hoarsely_]
Say it's not true.

BARON
What is not true?

VERA
What David said. It was the mob that massacred--_you_ had no hand in it.

BARON [_Sullenly_]
I was there with my soldiers.

DAVID [_Leaning, pale, against a chair, hisses_]
And you looked on with that cold face of hate--while my mother--my
sister----

BARON [_Sullenly_]
I could not see everything.

DAVID
Now and again you ordered your soldiers to fire----

VERA [_In joyous relief_]
Ah, he _did_ check the mob--he _did_ tell his soldiers to fire.

DAVID
At any Jew who tried to defend himself.

VERA
Great God!
     [_She falls on the sofa and buries her head on the cushion,
     moaning_]
Is there no pity in heaven?

DAVID
There was no pity on earth.

BARON
It was the People avenging itself, Vera. The People rose like a flood.
It had centuries of spoliation to wipe out. The voice of the People is
the voice of God.

VERA [_Moaning_]
But you could have stopped them.

BARON
I had no orders to defend the foes of Christ and
     [_Crossing himself_]
the Tsar. The People----

VERA
But you could have stopped them.

BARON
Who can stop a flood? I did my duty. A soldier's duty is not so pretty
as a musician's.

VERA
But you could have stopped them.

BARON [_Losing all patience_]
Silence! You talk like an ignorant girl, blinded by passion. The
_pogrom_ is a holy crusade. Are we Russians the first people to crush
down the Jew? No--from the dawn of history the nations have had to stamp
upon him--the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Persians, the Babylonians,
the Greeks, the Romans----

DAVID
Yes, it is true. Even Christianity did not invent hatred. But not till
Holy Church arose were we burnt at the stake, and not till Holy Russia
arose were our babes torn limb from limb. Oh, it is too much! Delivered
from Egypt four thousand years ago, to be slaves to the Russian Pharaoh
to-day.
     [_He falls as if kneeling on a chair, and, leans his head on the
     rail._]
O God, shall we always be broken on the wheel of history? How long, O
Lord, how long?

BARON [_Savagely_]
Till you are all stamped out, ground into your dirt.
     [_Tenderly_]
Look up, little Vera! You saw how _papasha_ loves you--how he was ready
to hold out his hand--and how this cur tried to bite it. Be calm--tell
him a daughter of Russia cannot mate with dirt.

VERA
Father, I will be calm. I will speak without passion or blindness. I
will tell David the truth. I was never absolutely sure of my love for
him--perhaps that was why I doubted his love for me--often after our
enchanted moments there would come a nameless uneasiness, some vague
instinct, relic of the long centuries of Jew-loathing, some strange
shrinking from his Christless creed----

BARON [_With an exultant cry_]
Ah! She is a Revendal.

VERA
But now----
     [_She rises and walks firmly toward DAVID_]
now, David, I come to you, and I say in the words of Ruth, thy people
shall be my people and thy God my God!
     [_She stretches out her hands to DAVID._]

BARON
You shameless----!
     [_He stops as he perceives DAVID remains impassive._]

VERA [_With agonised cry_]
David!

DAVID [_In low, icy tones_]
You cannot come to me. There is a river of blood between us.

VERA
Were it seven seas, our love must cross them.

DAVID
Easy words to you. You never saw that red flood bearing the mangled
breasts of women and the spattered brains of babes and sucklings. Oh!
     [_He covers his eyes with his hands. The BARON turns away in
     gloomy impotence. At last DAVID begins to speak quietly, almost
     dreamily._]
It was your Easter, and the air was full of holy bells and the streets
of holy processions--priests in black and girls in white and waving
palms and crucifixes, and everybody exchanging Easter eggs and kissing
one another three times on the mouth in token of peace and goodwill, and
even the Jew-boy felt the spirit of love brooding over the earth, though
he did not then know that this Christ, whom holy chants proclaimed
re-risen, was born in the form of a brother Jew. And what added to the
peace and holy joy was that our own Passover was shining before us. My
mother had already made the raisin wine, and my greedy little brother
Solomon had sipped it on the sly that very morning. We were all at
home--all except my father--he was away in the little Synagogue at which
he was cantor. Ah, such a voice he had--a voice of tears and
thunder--when he prayed it was like a wounded soul beating at the gates
of Heaven--but he sang even more beautifully in the ritual of home, and
how we were looking forward to his hymns at the Passover table----
     [_He breaks down. The BARON has gradually turned round under the
     spell of DAVID'S story and now listens hypnotised._]
I was playing my cracked little fiddle. Little Miriam was making her
doll dance to it. Ah, that decrepit old china doll--the only one the
poor child had ever had--I can see it now--one eye, no nose, half an
arm. We were all laughing to see it caper to my music.... My father
flies in through the door, desperately clasping to his breast the Holy
Scroll. The "Faces" are represented by a portrait of Ride-to-Khiva
BURNABY, and one of the Author of these entertaining papers. The first
brief narrative, which ought to have been called "How I met BURNABY,"
is specially interesting; and the only disappointing
     thing in the book is the omission of "An Evening with Witches,"
     as a companion picture to "A Night at Watts's."

By the way, in my copy
of _A Plantation Printer_, the English printer has made one slip,
a sin of omission, at p. 153, where, Miss CARTER, a charming young
lady, is watching a Georgian Fox-hunt.

She
sees "a group of shadows, with musical voices, sweep across the Bermuda
fields."
     "'O ow beautiful!' exclaimed Miss CARTER, clapping her little
     hands," and, we may add, dropping her little "h"
in her excitement. "I can put up with the loss of an 'h,' but not
for a wilderness of aspirates would I have lost this healthy,
cheery chapter," says
THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

POOR.
     
     (_A NOTE KINDLY CONTRIBUTED BY OUR OWN GRAPHIC REPORTER._)
     Nothing could have been more impressive than the closing scene of
a trial that was one of the features of the present Sessions.

The Counsel for the Prisoner made no pretence of
hiding his emotion, and freely
     used his pocket-handkerchief. Many ladies who had until now
     been occupied in using opera-glasses, at this point relinquished
     those assistants to the eyesight, to fall back upon the restorative
properties of bottles filled with smelling-salts.

Even
his Lordship on the Bench was seemingly
     touched to the very quick by the Prisoner's dignified appeal for
mercy.

Before passing
sentence, the Judge glanced for a moment at the number of titled and
other highly respectable witnesses who had testified to the integrity
of the accused.

Then
he addressed the Prisoner:--
"You have pleaded guilty to an indictment which charges you with having
misappropriated trust moneys.
     You have reduced a fortune of £28,000 to £7,000.

This means a wretched
pittance to beneficiaries who, before your fraud, were enjoying a
fairly decent income.

I am
aware that you are a distinguished Magistrate,--that you have belonged
to many Clubs,--that there
     is not a slur upon the cooking that used to distinguish your
dinner-parties.

I know
the severity of the sentence I am about to pass, and I wish my conscience
would permit me to give you a lighter punishment. But I cannot."
The accused was then sentenced to five years' penal servitude.

A little later another prisoner was put
in the dock for stealing twenty shillings. The prisoner
     (who was a sailor) was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude,
     and seven years' police supervision. The case was of no public
     interest.

BARON [_To DAVID_]
Halt!
     [_DAVID turns mechanically. VERA drifts out through her door,
     leaving the two men face to face. The BARON beckons to DAVID, who
     as if hypnotised moves nearer. The BARON whips out his pistol,
     slowly crosses to DAVID, who stands as if awaiting his fate. The
     BARON hands the pistol to DAVID._]
You were right!
     [_He steps back swiftly with a touch of stern heroism into the
     attitude of the culprit at a military execution, awaiting the
     bullet._]
Shoot me!

DAVID [_Takes the pistol mechanically, looks long and pensively at it as
     with a sense of its irrelevance. Gradually his arm droops and lets
     the pistol fall on the table, and there his hand touches a string
     of his violin, which yields a little note. Thus reminded of it, he
     picks up the violin, and as his fingers draw out the broken string
     he murmurs_]
I must get a new string.
     [_He resumes his dragging march toward the door, repeating
     maunderingly_]
I must get a new string.

Act IV


     _Saturday, July 4, evening. The Roof-Garden of the Settlement
     House, showing a beautiful, far-stretching panorama of New York,
     with its irregular sky-buildings on the left, and the harbour
     with its Statue of Liberty on the right. Everything is wet and
     gleaming after rain. Parapet at the back. Elevator on the right.
     Entrance from the stairs on the left. In the sky hang heavy
     clouds through which thin, golden lines of sunset are just
     beginning to labour. DAVID is discovered on a bench, hugging his
     violin-case to his breast, gazing moodily at the sky. A muffled
     sound of applause comes up from below and continues with varying
     intensity through the early part of the scene. Through it comes
     the noise of the elevator ascending. MENDEL steps out and hurries
     forward_.

MENDEL
Come down, David! Don't you hear them shouting for you?
     [_He passes his hand over the wet bench._]
Good heavens! You will get rheumatic fever!

DAVID
Why have you followed me?

MENDEL
Get up--everything is still damp.

DAVID [_Rising, gloomily_]
Yes, there's a damper over everything.

MENDEL
Nonsense--the rain hasn't damped your triumph in the least. In fact, the
more delicate effects wouldn't have gone so well in the open air.
Listen!

DAVID
Let them shout. Who told you I was up here?

MENDEL
Miss Revendal, of course.

DAVID [_Agitated_]
Miss Revendal? How should _she_ know?

MENDEL [_Sullenly_]
She seems to understand your crazy ways.

DAVID [_Passing his hand over his eyes_]
Ah, _you_ never understood me, uncle.... How did she look? Was she pale?

MENDEL
Never mind about Miss Revendal. "But don't you think it is playing
it a little low?" suggested the First Lord of the Admiralty.

"Well,
I don't know," returned the Autocrat of the W.O.

"After
all, there is nothing like personal experience."
And then all three were silent, lost in profound consideration.Now
Miss Revendal has told them.
     [_Louder applause._]
There! Eleven minutes it has gone on--like for an office-seeker. You
_must_ come and show yourself.
