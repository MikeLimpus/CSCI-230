among which, apparently, are the most famous of this era.

It's fun to end the following paragraph, pp. 54 back: "The principle
that the heresies were in Germany, was for these comedies such: gradually
began to introduce de facto representatives of clergy, religious,
loose, free and nuns and marriages performed by religious faith.

That began to dismiss people, coming to represent the ears to do
this, came then to do what they really represented the beginning
of ridicule and is married, publicly, religious faith, with serious
scandal and came to reject religion and entered this other heresies,
which was what the devil wanted. "[119]" Other component (comedy)

And all these problems would cease, and even many more who do not say,

examine all plays before they represent only those that _no be made in

underlined words, which then existed in Madrid censor theaters (and,
indeed, are ancient manuscripts of Lope de Vega and others, which
accompanies the license of the censor) very indulgent but, apparently,

Zarzuela, shone in his time equally popular muses Lope de Vega,
Tirso, and Moreto Calderon, the first, however, preferred the drama

with feathers of various colors they came with other people in

All of which, viewed in some ways unexpectedly fuss Don Quixote, and
put fear into the heart of Sancho, but then Don Quixote was glad,
thinking that he was offered a new and dangerous adventure, and
with this thought and spirit with provisions to undertake any danger,
was in front of the cart, and with loud and menacing, said: "Carter,

    [133] Montalván, _Fama póstuma_. [134] Lope de Vega says
    (preface to the volume of their _Comedias_ IX), he has not
    written any comedy to be transplanted to the office of the
    theater of the reader .-- The case of Cervantes, who printed his
own before being represented, perhaps the only thing we offer Spanish
literature of his time. [135] are useful for this purpose between
works of Lope, his innumerable epistles, the dedications of his
comedies, and the second part of _The Filomena_ and _The Dorotea_.

    Apparently, the poet refers to the latter, under the name of
    Don Fernando, the adventures of a part of his youth. But as
    poetry can be mixed with reality, should not give full
    credit to what it says, and in this Mr. Fauriel not go quite
    right when (_Revue des deux mondes_, chap. 19) considered
    as event real life of Lope as it refers; the opposite, but equally
wrong, is sustained by a Dámaso Hinard (in _Revue independante_)
of the entire novel is a fiction, since it says Lope More than once
the story is true, and that many parts of the life of Don Fernando
agrees with the vicissitudes of his well known.

Parécenos most adopt a sensible balance between these two extremes,
considering _The Dorotea_ as an aid to illustrated biography of the
poet, provided that their information is confirmed by other data
authentic. [136] _Epístola of Belardo á Amarilis._ [137] In a
collection of letters of Lope de Vega to the Duke of Sessa, D.

Agustín Durán has copied from the original autographs and that has made
me consider that I profess friendship is as follows: "I was born in
Madrid, where wall in the middle of Charles V became the pride of
France between two walls, and always be offered the opportunity,
will make his grandson as the example of his father, for he and San
Quentin can not forget the times that enters into San Lorenzo.

"According Mesonero Romans, the most profound knowledge of all locations
Madrid, Lope de Vega was born in the street, and at home, now
modern construction, numbers 7 and 8 older and 82 modern, block 415.

As this house is located near the ancient gate of Guadalajara and
the plaza de la Villa, where Francis I was a prisoner in the house
of Lujanes, this data is consistent with the indication made by the
same Lope de Vega.

Remarkable thing is that the house where this great poet was born,
was straight in front of one another, in which Calderon lived most
of his life.

The collection of letters referred to, whose authenticity can not
be doubted, because the same Durán says have copied from the original
autographs of Lope, and signs and also provide very reliable intrinsic
character, it contains many news insignificant, but there are other
useful and confirm to complete the biography of Lope.

Most importantly, a paragraph, when Madrid July 6 of 1611, which
says: "This way, most excellent sir, my life with this evil importunate
my wife, exercising acts of patience, who volunteers as if they
were accurate, it would not be here unless your penance principle
Purgatory, "and another September 7th of 1611, in which the Duke
said that his wife Jane is better.

Dedúcese also Lope that it did not come in as soon as the state
church Navarrete says, and following me, after repeated ... Some
questions I had were not committed any error in the copy the date,
but after mature thought, I have found that other circumstances
confirm its accuracy.

We know from Montalván that our poet's second wife died shortly after
her son Carlos, but then spent their _Pastores of Lope Belén_, whose
first edition appeared in 1612 (the license is November 1611),
this man, and is not possible to admit that if the publication of
the book, or at least when writing for print, no longer alive, the
dedication did not take any sign of punishment from his father.

Añádese this in another letter dated August 4 1604 it is said that
Jane gives good hopes, but as we only know of two children who Lope
had his second wife (Marcela and Lope, the youngest, were the result
of other romantic relationships), and as the birth of their daughter
Feliciana coincides with the death of his mother (epistle Belardo
Amarilis á), we must infer that the child born to John, to mid-1603,
was the same Carlos.

This died, says Montalván, at the age of seven years, and therefore
his death could not occur before 1611, and if the set in the late
autumn of this year (when _Los pastors of Belén_ were already in
print) , Doña Juana had to live at least until late 1612.

Lope and then could be the brother of guilds, and only later arranged
for a priest. In the letter last referred to, and other content, copy
here Part of them, which provides some interest for the life of
Lope or the history of the theater, being worthy of special attention
as Cervantes said, because it implied that there were serious enmity
between these two great men.

I am sure Jack felt it,
for, as soon as he decently could, he got up to go. Alicia asked him
to remain to dinner.

"We are having a few friends to dine with us, but it is quite an
informal affair," she said sweetly.

I felt that Jack glanced at me for the fraction of a second. But I
remembered that Gus Sinclair was coming too, and I did not look at
him.

Then he declined quietly. He had a business engagement, he said.

I suppose Alicia had noticed that look at me, for she showed her
claws.

"Don't forget to call any time you are in Montreal," she said more
sweetly than ever. "I am sure Katherine will always be glad to see any
of her old friends, although some of her new ones _are_ proving very
absorbing--one, in especial. Don't blush, Katherine, I am sure Mr.
Willoughby won't tell any tales out of school to your old Valleyfield
friends."

I was not blushing, and I was furious. It was really too bad of
Alicia, although I don't see why I need have cared.

Alicia kept her eye on us both until Jack was fairly gone. Then she
remarked in the patronizing tone which I detest:

"Really, Katherine, Jack Willoughby has developed into quite a
passable-looking fellow, although he is rather shabby. But I suppose
he is poor."

"Yes," I answered curtly, "he is poor, in everything except youth and
manhood and goodness and truth! But I suppose those don't count for
anything."

Whereupon Alicia lifted her eyebrows and looked me over.

Just at dusk a box arrived with Jack's compliments. It was full of
lovely white carnations, and must have cost the extravagant fellow
more than he has any business to waste on flowers. I was beast enough
to put them on when I went down to listen to another man's
love-making.

This evening I sparkled and scintillated with unusual brilliancy, for
Jack's visit and my consequent crossing of swords with Alicia had
produced a certain elation of spirits. When Gus Sinclair was leaving
he asked if he might see me alone tomorrow afternoon.

I knew what that meant, and a cold shiver went up and down my
backbone. But I looked down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--_his_
neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three
o'clock.

Alicia had noticed our aside--when did anything ever escape her?--and
when he was gone she asked, significantly, what secret he had been
telling me.

"He wants to see me alone tomorrow afternoon. I suppose you know what
that means, Alicia?"

"Ah," purred Alicia, "I congratulate you, my dear."

"Aren't your congratulations a little premature?" I asked coldly. "I
haven't accepted him yet."

"But you will?"

"Oh, certainly. Isn't it what we've schemed and angled for? I'm very
well satisfied."

And so I am. But I wish it hadn't come so soon after Jack's visit,
because I feel rather upset yet. Of course I like Gus Sinclair very
much, and I am sure I shall be very fond of him.

Well, I must go to bed now and get my beauty sleep. I don't want to be
haggard and hollow-eyed at that important interview tomorrow--an
interview that will decide my destiny.

       *       *       *       *       *

                                   Thrush Hill, May 6, 18--.

Well, it did decide it, but not exactly in the way I anticipated. I
can look back on the whole affair quite calmly now, but I wouldn't
live it over again for all the wealth of Ind.

That day when Gus Sinclair came I was all ready for him. I had put on
my very prettiest new gown to do honour to the occasion, and Alicia
smilingly assured me I was looking very well.

"And _so_ cool and composed. Will you be able to keep that up? Don't
you really feel a little nervous, Katherine?"

"Not in the least," I said. "I suppose I ought to be, according to
traditions, but I never felt less flustered in my life."

When Bessie brought up Gus Sinclair's card Alicia dropped a pecky
little kiss on my cheek, and pushed me toward the door. I went down
calmly, although I'll admit that my heart _was_ beating wildly. Gus
Sinclair was plainly nervous, but I was composed enough for both. You
would really have thought that I was in the habit of being proposed to
by a millionaire every day.

"I suppose you know what I have come to say," he said, standing before
me, as I leaned gracefully back in a big chair, having taken care that
the folds of my dress fell just as they should.

And then he proceeded to say it in a rather jumbled-up fashion, but
very sincerely.

I remember thinking at the time that he must have composed the speech
in his head the night before, and rehearsed it several times, but was
forgetting it in spots.

When he ended with the self-same question that Jack had asked me three
months before at Thrush Hill he stopped and took my hands.

I looked up at him. His good, homely face was close to mine, and in
his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness.

I opened my mouth to say yes.

And then there came over me in one rush the most awful realization of
the sacrilege I was going to commit.

I forgot everything except that I loved Jack Willoughby, and that I
could never, never marry anybody in the world except him.

Then I pulled my hands away and burst into hysterical, undignified
tears.

"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Sinclair. "I did not mean to startle
you. Have I been too abrupt? Surely you must have known--you must have
expected--"

"Yes--yes--I knew," I cried miserably, "and I intended right up to
this very minute to marry you. I'm so sorry--but I can't--I can't."

"I don't understand," he said in a bewildered tone. "If you expected
it, then why--why--don't you care for me?"

"No, that's just it," I sobbed. "I don't love you at all--and I do
love somebody else. But he is poor, and I hate poverty. So I refused
him, and I meant to marry you just because you are rich."

Such a pained look came over his face. "I did not think this of you,"
he said in a low tone.

"Oh, I know I have acted shamefully," I said. "You can't think any
worse of me than I do of myself. How you must despise me!"

"No," he said, with a grim smile, "if I did it would be easier for me.
I might not love you then. Don't distress yourself, Katherine. I do
not deny that I feel greatly hurt and disappointed, but I am glad you
have been true to yourself at last. Don't cry, dear."

"You're very good," I answered disconsolately, "but all the same the
fact remains that I have behaved disgracefully to you, and I know you
think so. Oh, Mr. Sinclair, please, please, go away. I feel so
miserably ashamed of myself that I cannot look you in the face."

"I am going, dear," he said gently. "I know all this must be very
painful to you, but it is not easy for me, either."

"Can you forgive me?" I said wistfully.

"Yes, my dear, completely. Do not let yourself be unhappy over this.
Remember that I will always be your friend. Goodbye."

He held out his hand and gave mine an earnest clasp. Then he went
away.

I remained in the drawing-room, partly because I wanted to finish out
my cry, and partly because, miserable coward that I was, I didn't dare
face Alicia. Finally she came in, her face wreathed with anticipatory
smiles. But when her eyes fell on my forlorn, crumpled self she fairly
jumped.

"Katherine, what is the matter?" she asked sharply. "Didn't Mr.
Sinclair--"

"Yes, he did," I said desperately. "And I've refused him. There now,
Alicia!"

Then I waited for the storm to burst. It didn't all at once. The shock
was too great, and at first quite paralyzed my half-sister.

"Katherine," she gasped, "are you crazy? Have you lost your senses?"

"No, I've just come to them. It's true enough, Alicia. You can scold
all you like. I know I deserve it, and I won't flinch. I did really
intend to take him, but when it came to the point I couldn't. I didn't
love him."

Then, indeed, the storm burst. I never saw Alicia so angry before, and
I never got so roundly abused. But even Alicia has her limits, and at
last she grew calmer.

"You have behaved disgracefully," she concluded. "I am disgusted with
you. You have encouraged Gus Sinclair markedly right along, and now
you throw him over like this. I never dreamed that you were capable of
such unwomanly behaviour."

"That's a hard word, Alicia," I protested feebly.

She dealt me a withering glance. "It does not begin to be as hard as
your shameful conduct merits. To think of losing a fortune like that
for the sake of sentimental folly! I didn't think you were such a
consummate fool."

"I suppose you absorbed all the sense of our family," I said drearily.
"There now, Alicia, do leave me alone. I'm down in the very depths
already."

"What do you mean to do now?" said Alicia scornfully. "Go back to
Valleyfield and marry that starving country doctor of yours, I
suppose?"

I flared up then; Alicia might abuse me all she liked, but I wasn't
going to hear a word against Jack.

"Yes, I will, if he'll have me," I said, and I marched out of the room
and upstairs, with my head very high.

Of course I decided to leave Montreal as soon as I could. But I
couldn't get away within a week, and it was a very unpleasant one.
Alicia treated me with icy indifference, and I knew I should never be
reinstated in her good graces.

To my surprise, Roger took my part. "Let the girl alone," he told
Alicia. "If she doesn't love Sinclair, she was right in refusing him.
I, for one, am glad that she has got enough truth and womanliness in
her to keep her from selling herself."

Then he came to the library where I was moping, and laid his hand on
my head.

"Little girl," he said earnestly, "no matter what anyone says to you,
never marry a man for his money or for any other reason on earth
except because you love him."

This comforted me greatly, and I did not cry myself to sleep that
night as usual.

At last I got away. I had telegraphed to Jack: "Am coming home
Wednesday; meet me at train," and I knew he would be there. How I
longed to see him again--dear, old, badly treated Jack.

I got to Valleyfield just at dusk. It was a rainy evening, and
everything was slush and fog and gloom. But away up I saw the home
light at Thrush Hill, and Jack was waiting for me on the platform.

"Oh, Jack!" I said, clinging to him, regardless of appearances. "Oh,
I'm so glad to be back."

"That's right, Kitty. I knew you wouldn't forget us. How well you are
looking!"

"I suppose I ought to be looking wretched," I said penitently. "I've
been behaving very badly, Jack. Wait till we get away from the crowd
and I'll tell you all about it."

And I did.

I didn't gloss over anything, but just confessed the whole truth. Jack
heard me through in silence, and then he kissed me.

"Can you forgive me, Jack, and take me back?" I whispered, cuddling up
to him.

And he said--but, on second thought, I will not write down what he
said.

We are to be married in June.


A Substitute Journalist


Clifford Baxter came into the sitting-room where Patty was darning
stockings and reading a book at the same time. Patty could do things
like that. The stockings were well darned too, and Patty understood
and remembered what she read.

Clifford flung himself into a chair with a sigh of weariness. "Tired?"
queried Patty sympathetically.

"Yes, rather. I've been tramping about the wharves all day gathering
longshore items. But, Patty, I've got a chance at last. Tonight as I
was leaving the office Mr. Harmer gave me a real assignment for
tomorrow--two of them in fact, but only one of importance. I'm to go
and interview Mr. Keefe on this new railroad bill that's up before the
legislature. He's in town, visiting his old college friend, Mr. Reid,
and he's quite big game. I wouldn't have had the assignment, of
course, if there'd been anyone else to send, but most of the staff
will be away all day tomorrow to see about that mine explosion at
Midbury or the teamsters' strike at Bainsville, and I'm the only one
available. Harmer gave me a pretty broad hint that it was my chance to
win my spurs, and that if I worked up a good article out of it I'd
stand a fair show of being taken on permanently next month when Alsop
leaves. There'll be a shuffle all round then, you know. Everybody on
the staff will be pushed up a peg, and that will leave a vacant space
at the foot."

Patty threw down her darning needle and clapped her hands with
delight. Clifford gazed at her admiringly, thinking that he had the
prettiest sister in the world--she was so bright, so eager, so rosy.

"Oh, Clifford, how splendid!" she exclaimed. "Just as we'd begun to
give up hope too. Oh, you must get the position! You must hand in a
good write-up. Think what it means to us."

"Yes, I know." Clifford dropped his head on his hand and stared
rather moodily at the lamp. "But my joy is chastened, Patty. Of course
I want to get the permanency, since it seems to be the only possible
thing, but you know my heart isn't really in newspaper work. The plain
truth is I don't like it, although I do my best. You know Father
always said I was a born mechanic. If I only could get a position
somewhere among machinery--that would be my choice. There's one vacant
in the Steel and Iron Works at Bancroft--but of course I've no chance
of getting it."

"I know. It's too bad," said Patty, returning to her stockings with a
sigh. "I wish I were a boy with a foothold on the _Chronicle_. I
firmly believe that I'd make a good newspaper woman, if such a thing
had ever been heard of in Aylmer."

"That you would. You've twice as much knack in that line as I have.
You seem to know by instinct just what to leave out and put in. I
never do, and Harmer has to blue-pencil my copy mercilessly. Well,
I'll do my best with this, as it's very necessary I should get the
permanency, for I fear our family purse is growing very slim. Mother's
face has a new wrinkle of worry every day. It hurts me to see it."

"And me," sighed Patty. "I do wish I could find something to do too.
If only we both could get positions, everything would be all right.
Mother wouldn't have to worry so. Don't say anything about this chance
to her until you see what comes of it. She'd only be doubly
disappointed if nothing did. What is your other assignment?"

"Oh, I've got to go out to Bancroft on the morning train and write up
old Mr. Moreland's birthday celebration. He is a hundred years old,
and there's going to be a presentation and speeches and that sort of
thing. Nothing very exciting about it. I'll have to come back on the
three o'clock train and hurry out to catch my politician before he
leaves at five. Take a stroll down to meet my train, Patty. We can go
out as far as Mr. Reid's house together, and the walk will do you
good."

The Baxters lived in Aylmer, a lively little town with two
newspapers, the _Chronicle_ and the _Ledger_. Between these two was a
sharp journalistic rivalry in the matter of "beats" and "scoops." In
the preceding spring Clifford had been taken on the _Chronicle_ on
trial, as a sort of general handyman. There was no pay attached to the
position, but he was getting training and there was the possibility of
a permanency in September if he proved his mettle. Mr. Baxter had died
two years before, and the failure of the company in which Mrs.
Baxter's money was invested had left the little family dependent on
their own resources. Clifford, who had cherished dreams of a course in
mechanical engineering, knew that he must give them up and go to the
first work that offered itself, which he did staunchly and
uncomplainingly. Patty, who hitherto had had no designs on a "career,"
but had been sunnily content to be a home girl and Mother's right
hand, also realized that it would be well to look about her for
something to do. She was not really needed so far as the work of the
little house went, and the whole burden must not be allowed to fall on
Clifford's eighteen-year-old shoulders. Patty was his senior by a
year, and ready to do her part unflinchingly.

The next afternoon Patty went down to meet Clifford's train. When it
came, no Clifford appeared. Patty stared about her at the hurrying
throngs in bewilderment. Where was Clifford? Hadn't he come on the
train? Surely he must have, for there was no other until seven
o'clock. She must have missed him somehow. Patty waited until
everybody had left the station, then she walked slowly homeward. As
the _Chronicle_ office was on her way, she dropped in to see if
Clifford had reported there.

She found nobody in the editorial offices except the office boy, Larry
Brown, who promptly informed her that not only had Clifford not
arrived, but that there was a telegram from him saying that he had
missed his train. Patty gasped in dismay. It was dreadful!

"Where is Mr. Harmer?" she asked.

"He went home as soon as the afternoon edition came out. He left
before the telegram came. He'll be furious when he finds out that
nobody has gone to interview that foxy old politician," said Larry,
who knew all about Clifford's assignment and its importance.

"Isn't there anyone else here to go?" queried Patty desperately.

Larry shook his head. "No, there isn't a soul in. We're mighty
short-handed just now on account of the explosion and the strike."

Patty went downstairs and stood for a moment in the hall, rapt in
reflection. If she had been at home, she verily believed she would
have sat down and cried. Oh, it was too bad, too disappointing!
Clifford would certainly lose all chance of the permanency, even if
the irate news editor did not discharge him at once. What could she
do? Could she do anything? She _must_ do something.

"If I only could go in his place," moaned Patty softly to herself.

Then she started. Why not? Why not go and interview the big man
herself? To be sure, she did not know a great deal about interviewing,
still less about railroad bills, and nothing at all about politics.
But if she did her best it might be better than nothing, and might at
least save Clifford his present hold.

With Patty, to decide was to act. She flew back to the reporters'
room, pounced on a pencil and tablet, and hurried off, her breath
coming quickly, and her eyes shining with excitement. It was quite a
long walk out to Mr. Reid's place and Patty was tired when she got
there, but her courage was not a whit abated. She mounted the steps
and rang the bell undauntedly.

"Can I see Mr.--Mr.--Mr.--" Patty paused for a moment in dismay. She
had forgotten the name. The maid who had come to the door looked her
over so superciliously that Patty flushed with indignation. "The
gentleman who is visiting Mr. Reid," she said crisply. "I can't
remember his name, but I've come to interview him on behalf of the
_Chronicle_. Is he in?"

"If you mean Mr. Reefer, he is," said the maid quite respectfully.
Evidently the _Chronicle_'s name carried weight in the Reid
establishment. "Please come into the library. I'll go and tell him."

Patty had just time to seat herself at the table, spread out her paper
imposingly, and assume a businesslike air when Mr. Reefer came in. He
was a tall, handsome old man with white hair, jet-black eyes, and a
mouth that made Patty hope she wouldn't stumble on any questions he
wouldn't want to answer. Patty knew she would waste her breath if she
did. A man with a mouth like that would never tell anything he didn't
want to tell.

"Good afternoon. What can I do for you, madam?" inquired Mr. Reefer
with the air and tone of a man who means to be courteous, but has no
time or information to waste.

Patty was almost overcome by the "Madam." For a moment, she quailed.
She couldn't ask that masculine sphinx questions! Then the thought of
her mother's pale, careworn face flashed across her mind, and all her
courage came back with an inspiriting rush. She bent forward to look
eagerly into Mr. Reefer's carved, granite face, and said with a frank
smile:

"I have come to interview you on behalf of the _Chronicle_ about the
railroad bill. It was my brother who had the assignment, but he has
missed his train and I have come in his place because, you see, it is
so important to us. So much depends on this assignment. Perhaps Mr.
Harmer will give Clifford a permanent place on the staff if he turns
in a good article about you. He is only handyman now. I just couldn't
let him miss the chance--he might never have another. And it means so
much to us and Mother."

"Are you a member of the _Chronicle_ staff yourself?" inquired Mr.
Reefer with a shade more geniality in his tone.

"Oh, no! I've nothing to do with it, so you won't mind my being
inexperienced, will you? I don't know just what I should ask you, so
won't you please just tell me everything about the bill, and Mr.
Harmer can cut out what doesn't matter?"

Mr. Reefer looked at Patty for a few moments with a face about as
expressive as a graven image. Perhaps he was thinking about the bill,
and perhaps he was thinking what a bright, vivid, plucky little girl
this was with her waiting pencil and her air that strove to be
businesslike, and only succeeded in being eager and hopeful and
anxious.

"I'm not used to being interviewed myself," he said slowly, "so I
don't know very much about it. We're both green hands together, I
imagine. But I'd like to help you out, so I don't mind telling you
what I think about this bill, and its bearing on certain important
interests."

Mr. Reefer proceeded to tell her, and Patty's pencil flew as she
scribbled down his terse, pithy sentences. She found herself asking
questions too, and enjoying it. For the first time, Patty thought she
might rather like politics if she understood them--and they did not
seem so hard to understand when a man like Mr. Reefer explained them.
For half an hour he talked to her, and at the end of that time Patty
was in full possession of his opinion on the famous railroad bill in
all its aspects.

"There now, I'm talked out," said Mr. Reefer. "You can tell your news
editor that you know as much about the railroad bill as Andrew Reefer
knows. I hope you'll succeed in pleasing him, and that your brother
will get the position he wants. But he shouldn't have missed that
train. You tell him that. Boys with important things to do mustn't
miss trains. Perhaps it's just as well he did in this case though,
but tell him not to let it happen again."

Patty went straight home, wrote up her interview in ship-shape form,
and took it down to the _Chronicle_ office. There she found Mr.
Harmer, scowling blackly. The little news editor looked to be in a
rather bad temper, but he nodded not unkindly to Patty. Mr. Harmer
knew the Baxters well and liked them, although he would have
sacrificed them all without a qualm for a "scoop."

"Good evening, Patty. Take a chair. That brother of yours hasn't
turned up yet. The next time I give him an assignment, he'll manage to
be on hand in time to do it."

"Oh," cried Patty breathlessly, "please, Mr. Harmer, I have the
interview here. I thought perhaps I could do it in Clifford's place,
and I went out to Mr. Reid's and saw Mr. Reefer. He was very kind
and--"

"Mr. who?" fairly shouted Mr. Harmer.

"Mr. Reefer--Mr. Andrew Reefer. He told me to tell you that this
article contained all he knew or thought about the railroad bill
and--"

But Mr. Harmer was no longer listening. He had snatched the neatly
written sheets of Patty's report and was skimming over them with a
practised eye. Then Patty thought he must have gone crazy. He danced
around the office, waving the sheets in the air, and then he dashed
frantically up the stairs to the composing room.

Ten minutes later, he returned and shook the mystified Patty by the
hand.

"Patty, it's the biggest beat we've ever had! We've scooped not only
the _Ledger_, but every other newspaper in the country. How did you do
it? How did you ever beguile or bewitch Andrew Reefer into giving you
an interview?"

"Why," said Patty in utter bewilderment, "I just went out to Mr.
Reid's and asked for the gentleman who was visiting there--I'd
forgotten his name--and Mr. Reefer came down and I told him my
brother had been detailed to interview him on behalf of the
_Chronicle_ about the bill, and that Clifford had missed his train,
and wouldn't he let me interview him in his place and excuse my
inexperience--and he did."

"It wasn't Andrew Reefer I told Clifford to interview," laughed Mr.
Harmer. "It was John C. Keefe. I didn't know Reefer was in town, but
even if I had I wouldn't have thought it a particle of use to send a
man to him. He has never consented to be interviewed before on any
known subject, and he's been especially close-mouthed about this bill,
although men from all the big papers in the country have been after
him. He is notorious on that score. Why, Patty, it's the biggest
journalistic fish that has ever been landed in this office. Andrew
Reefer's opinion on the bill will have a tremendous influence. We'll
run the interview as a leader in a special edition that is under way
already. Of course, he must have been ready to give the information to
the public or nothing would have induced him to open his mouth. But to
think that we should be the first to get it! Patty, you're a brick!"

Clifford came home on the seven o'clock train, and Patty was there to
meet him, brimful of her story. But Clifford also had a story to tell
and got his word in first.

"Now, Patty, don't scold until you hear why I missed the train. I met
Mr. Peabody of the Steel and Iron Company at Mr. Moreland's and got
into conversation with him. When he found out who I was, he was
greatly interested and said Father had been one of his best friends
when they were at college together. I told him about wanting to get
the position in the company, and he had me go right out to the works
and see about it. And, Patty, I have the place. Goodbye to the grind
of newspaper items and fillers. I tried to get back to the station at
Bancroft in time to catch the train but I couldn't, and it was just as
well, for Mr. Keefe was suddenly summoned home this afternoon, and
when the three-thirty train from town stopped at Bancroft he was on
it. I found that out and I got on, going to the next station with him
and getting my interview after all. It's here in my notebook, and I
must hurry up to the office and hand it in. I suppose Mr. Harmer will
be very much vexed until he finds that I have it."

"Oh, no. Mr. Harmer is in a very good humour," said Patty with dancing
eyes. Then she told her story.

The interview with Mr. Reefer came out with glaring headlines, and the
_Chronicle_ had its hour of fame and glory. The next day Mr. Harmer
sent word to Patty that he wanted to see her.

"So Clifford is leaving," he said abruptly when she entered the
office. "Well, do you want his place?"

"Mr. Harmer, are you joking?" demanded Patty in amazement.

"Not I. That stuff you handed in was splendidly written--I didn't have
to use the pencil more than once or twice. You have the proper
journalist instinct all right. We need a lady on the staff anyhow, and
if you'll take the place it's yours for saying so, and the permanency
next month."

"I'll take it," said Patty promptly and joyfully.

"Good. Go down to the Symphony Club rehearsal this afternoon and
report it. You've just ten minutes to get there," and Patty joyfully
and promptly departed.


Anna's Love Letters


"Are you going to answer Gilbert's letter tonight, Anna?" asked Alma
Williams, standing in the pantry doorway, tall, fair, and grey-eyed,
with the sunset light coming down over the dark firs, through the
window behind her, and making a primrose nimbus around her shapely
head.

Anna, dark, vivid, and slender, was perched on the edge of the table,
idly swinging her slippered foot at the cat's head. She smiled
wickedly at Alma before replying.

"I am not going to answer it tonight or any other night," she said,
twisting her full, red lips in a way that Alma had learned to dread.
Mischief was ripening in Anna's brain when that twist was out.

"What do you mean?" asked Alma anxiously.

"Just what I say, dear," responded Anna, with deceptive meekness.
"Poor Gilbert is gone, and I don't intend to bother my head about him
any longer. He was amusing while he lasted, but of what use is a beau
two thousand miles away, Alma?"

Alma was patient--outwardly. It was never of any avail to show
impatience with Anna.

"Anna, you are talking foolishly. Of course you are going to answer
his letter. You are as good as engaged to him. Wasn't that practically
understood when he left?"

"No, no, dear," and Anna shook her sleek black head with the air of
explaining matters to an obtuse child. "_I_ was the only one who
understood. Gil _mis_understood. He thought that I would really wait
for him until he should have made enough money to come home and pay
off the mortgage. "No, certainly not," assured This. "Tell me
something now," the continued Senn, who has a few restless on the wet
cloth, which is now on the table was, then again to the small
kettle compatriots had.

"Tell me this, I have been since the cloth on my forehead had a
heraufkamst you this morning?"

Now this was very dark red. Because he thought if the Senn know
everything, what he had done, so it was perhaps not quite, and it
might be evil.

But Franz Anton looked at him now so deeply into their eyes
that everything he had to say: "I've even put it," he began timidly
to.

"Why, this?" Senn asked astonished. "Because they were so hot,"
said This. The more and more amazed Senn. "But I'm already awake at
sunrise," he said.

"When did you come up as?" "Today at five, or four clock", stuttered
fearful of this, "the milker was a long time afterwards." "What,
you're the whole night up here have been, what hast thou willed and
done? "Now saw the Franz Anton, that the this was quite
anxious, but he himself fell went back to the operations of the
last night.

Quite paternally he patted the boy on the shoulder and said encouraging:
"Before I need you not to fear this. Since, drink another one, and
then tell me everything you know from then on, when you here did
come up. " This encouragement took out of this new courage.

First he drank the milk in a few lines, because they tasted great.
Then he began to report: "I have just a little you wanted up here,
but just like all days, not because of the Käsfische. And because
the Milker long the milk had not come and you, I wanted you. And
then I found you on the ground, and you are red hot and thirsty and
have been held. Then I swiftly to swamp hole hinabgelaufen and have all
the great picked strawberries, which were still there, and have
brought them to you. And you have taken it gladly.

But you have shown on the head and on water demands. As I have from the
hut Chen brought the bowl and the small boiler, and on Pond brook, I
have filled him. Then, I have the bowl with the water on Chen's head
geschüttet and also to drink, because they have always had a thirst.
When the boiler was empty, I'm over to the stream and have it filled
again . But because the water is always so fast that, I thought was
a thick cloth to cool the head better. And I have the cloth out
of the hut and brought it very wet on your head. Only when it is dry
and then was hot, I have again dipped into the kettle and then wet
again on the head did. In the morning you are awakened, and I was
happy, I've always thought that if you only not sick. "The Senn
had listened with great attention.

Now everything was clear before him, what he had experienced the
night. He knew also, as he half-awake in fever and the angel with
the strawberries as a savior and then felt the waters of the Bach
Schwemme had felt and enjoyed.

       The Franz Anton This looked to be silent and puzzled, as if he had
never seen a boy.

No, he had such a never before seen. How was it possible that this boy,
all the stupid people just said this, had saved his life. If this
be the fever with the water removed, who knows what until morning
it would have become! And how did this this, nobody had a kind word, a
sacrifice to be able to capture the whole night at another and watched
him the habit!

The big, strong Franz Anton came the tears in his eyes when he was the
shy, this installations and despised everything covered. He now took
the boy by the hand and said: "We want to remain good friends, This,
I have much to thank thee, that I will not forget. Do me a favor just
yet, I shake the limbs so that I now resign must. now you go down to
my mother and tell her she should come up to me, unless I'm not
entirely comfortable.

You must also then come back with her, I have much to talk with you
today, do not forget it! " As long as he lived, this was never been so
happy. He started jumping down the hill as if he is not high enough
to jump up for joy. Now Senn had ordered him back, and he no
longer needed to hide, but the same could occur in the sheepfold.
Furthermore, the Franz Anton told him that he wanted good friend with
him to stay.
She could not
bear the thought that some day Anna might leave her and go far away to
live. In the second and largest place, she desired the marriage
because Gilbert did. She had always been desirous, even in the old,
childish play-days, that Gilbert should get just exactly what he
wanted. She had always taken a keen, strange delight in furthering his
wishes.

Anna's falseness would surely break his heart, and Alma winced at the
thought of his pain.

There was one thing she could do. Anna's tormenting suggestion had
fallen on fertile soil. Alma balanced pros and cons, admitting the
risk. But she would have taken a tenfold larger risk in the hope of
holding secure Anna's place in Gilbert's affections until Anna herself
should come to her senses.

When it grew quite dark and Anna had gone lilting down the lane on her
way to prayer meeting, Alma lighted her lamp, read Gilbert's
letter--and answered it. Her handwriting was much like Anna's. She
signed the letter "A. Williams," and there was nothing in it that
might not have been written by her to Gilbert; but she knew that
Gilbert would believe Anna had written it, and she intended him so to
believe. Alma never did a thing halfway when she did it at all. At
first she wrote rather constrainedly but, reflecting that in any case
Anna would have written a merely friendly letter, she allowed her
thoughts to run freely, and the resulting epistle was an excellent one
of its kind. Alma had the gift of expression and more brains than
Exeter people had ever imagined she possessed. When Gilbert read that
letter a fortnight later he was surprised to find that Anna was so
clever. He had always, with a secret regret, thought her much inferior
to Alma in this respect, but that delightful letter, witty, wise,
fanciful, was the letter of a clever woman.

When a year had passed Alma was still writing to Gilbert the letters
signed "A. Williams." She had ceased to fear being found out, and she
took a strange pleasure in the correspondence for its own sake. At
first she had been quakingly afraid of discovery. When she smuggled
the letters addressed in Gilbert's handwriting to Miss Anna Williams
out of the letter packet and hid them from Anna's eyes, she felt as
guilty as if she were breaking all the laws of the land at once. To be
sure, she knew that she would have to confess to Anna some day, when
the latter repented and began to wish she had written to Gilbert, but
that was a very different thing from premature disclosure.

But Anna had as yet given no sign of such repentance, although Alma
looked for it anxiously. Anna was having the time of her life. She was
the acknowledged beauty of five settlements, and she went forward on
her career of conquest quite undisturbed by the jealousies and
heart-burnings she provoked on every side.

One moonlight night she went for a sleigh-drive with Charlie Moore of
East Exeter--and returned to tell Alma that they were married!

"I knew you would make a fuss, Alma, because you don't like Charlie,
so we just took matters into our own hands. It was so much more
romantic, too. I'd always said I'd never be married in any of your
dull, commonplace ways. You might as well forgive me and be nice right
off, Alma, because you'd have to do it anyway, in time. Well, you do
look surprised!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Alma accepted the situation with an apathy that amazed Anna. The truth
was that Alma was stunned by a thought that had come to her even while
Anna was speaking.

"Gilbert will find out about the letters now, and despise me."

Nothing else, not even the fact that Anna had married shiftless
Charlie Moore, seemed worth while considering beside this. The fear
and shame of it haunted her like a nightmare; she shrank every morning
from the thought of all the mail that was coming that day, fearing
that there would be an angry, puzzled letter from Gilbert. He must
certainly soon hear of Anna's marriage; he would see it in the home
paper, other correspondents in Exeter would write him of it. Alma grew
sick at heart thinking of the complications in front of her.

When Gilbert's letter came she left it for a whole day before she
could summon courage to open it. But it was a harmless epistle after
all; he had not yet heard of Anna's marriage. Alma had at first no
thought of answering it, yet her fingers ached to do so. Now that Anna
was gone, her loneliness was unbearable. She realized how much
Gilbert's letters had meant to her, even when written to another
woman. She could bear her life well enough, she thought, if she only
had his letters to look forward to.

No more letters came from Gilbert for six weeks. Then came one,
alarmed at Anna's silence, anxiously asking the reason for it; Gilbert
had heard no word of the marriage. He was working in a remote district
where newspapers seldom penetrated. He had no other correspondent in
Exeter now; except his mother, and she, not knowing that he supposed
himself engaged to Anna had forgotten to mention it.

Alma answered that letter. She told herself recklessly that she would
keep on writing to him until he found out. She would lose his
friendship anyhow, when that occurred, but meanwhile she would have
the letters a little longer. She could not learn to live without them
until she had to.

The correspondence slipped back into its old groove. The harassed look
which Alma's face had worn, and which Exeter people had attributed to
worry over Anna, disappeared. She did not even feel lonely, and
reproached herself for lack of proper feeling in missing Anna so
little. Besides, to her horror and dismay, she detected in herself a
strange undercurrent of relief at the thought that Gilbert could never
marry Anna now! She could not understand it. Had not that marriage
been her dearest wish for years? Why then should she feel this strange
gladness at the impossibility of its fulfilment? Altogether, Alma
feared that her condition of mind and morals must be sadly askew.
Perhaps, she thought mournfully, this perversion of proper feeling was
her punishment for the deception she had practised. She had
deliberately done evil that good might come, and now the very
imaginations of her heart were stained by that evil. Alma cried
herself to sleep many a night in her repentance, but she kept on
writing to Gilbert, for all that.

The winter passed, and the spring and summer waned, and Alma's outward
life flowed as smoothly as the currents of the seasons, broken only by
vivid eruptions from Anna, who came over often from East Exeter,
glorying in her young matronhood, "to cheer Alma up." Alma, so said
Exeter people, was becoming unsociable and old maidish. She lost her
liking for company, and seldom went anywhere among her neighbours. Her
once frequent visits across the yard to chat with old Mrs. Murray
became few and far between. She could not bear to hear the old lady
talking about Gilbert, and she was afraid that some day she would be
told that he was coming home. Gilbert's home-coming was the nightmare
dread that darkened poor Alma's whole horizon.

       *       *       *       *       *

One October day, two years after Gilbert's departure, Alma, standing
at her window in the reflected glow of a red maple outside, looked
down the lane and saw him striding up it! She had had no warning of
his coming. His last letter, dated three weeks back, had not hinted at
it. Yet there he was--and with him Alma's Nemesis.

She was very calm. Now that the worst had come, she felt quite strong
to meet it. She would tell Gilbert the truth, and he would go away in
anger and never forgive her, but she deserved it. As she went
downstairs, the only thing that really worried her was the thought of
the pain Gilbert would suffer when she told him of Anna's
faithlessness. She had seen his face as he passed under her window,
and it was the face of a blithe man who had not heard any evil
tidings. It was left to her to tell him; surely, she thought
apathetically, that was punishment enough for what she had done.

With her hand on the doorknob, she paused to wonder what she should
say when he asked her why she had not told him of Anna's marriage when
it occurred--why she had still continued the deception when it had no
longer an end to serve. Well, she would tell him the truth--that it
was because she could not bear the thought of giving up writing to
him. It was a humiliating thing to confess, but that did not
matter--nothing mattered now. She opened the door.

Gilbert was standing on the big round door-stone under the red
maple--a tall, handsome young fellow with a bronzed face and laughing
eyes. His exile had improved him. Alma found time and ability to
reflect that she had never known Gilbert was so fine-looking.

He put his arm around her and kissed her cheek in his frank delight at
seeing her again. Alma coldly asked him in. Her face was still as pale
as when she came downstairs, but a curious little spot of fiery red
blossomed out where Gilbert's lips had touched it.

Gilbert followed her into the sitting-room and looked about eagerly.

"When did you come home?" she said slowly. "I did not know you were
expected."

"Got homesick, and just came! I wanted to surprise you all," he
answered, laughing. "I arrived only a few minutes ago. Just took time
to hug my mother, and here I am. Where's Anna?"

The pent-up retribution of two years descended on Alma's head in the
last question of Gilbert's. But she did not flinch. She stood straight
before him, tall and fair and pale, with the red maple light streaming
in through the open door behind her, staining her light house-dress
and mellowing the golden sheen of her hair. Gilbert reflected that
Alma Williams was really a very handsome girl. These two years had
improved her. What splendid big grey eyes she had! He had always
wished that Anna's eyes had not been quite so black.

"Anna is not here," said Alma. "She is married."

"Married!"

Gilbert sat down suddenly on a chair and looked at Alma in
bewilderment.

"She has been married for a year," said Alma steadily. "She married
Charlie Moore of East Exeter, and has been living there ever since."

"Then," said Gilbert, laying hold of the one solid fact that loomed
out of the mist of his confused understanding, "why did she keep on
writing letters to me after she was married?"

"She never wrote to you at all. It was I that wrote the letters."

Gilbert looked at Alma doubtfully. Was she crazy? There was something
odd about her, now that he noticed, as she stood rigidly there, with
that queer red spot on her face, a strange fire in her eyes, and that
weird reflection from the maple enveloping her like an immaterial
flame.

"I don't understand," he said helplessly.

Still standing there, Alma told the whole story, giving full
explanations, but no excuses. She told it clearly and simply, for she
had often pictured this scene to herself and thought out what she must
say. Her memory worked automatically, and her tongue obeyed it
promptly. To herself she seemed like a machine, talking mechanically,
while her soul stood on one side and listened.

When she had finished there was a silence lasting perhaps ten seconds.
To Alma it seemed like hours. Would Gilbert overwhelm her with angry
reproaches, or would he simply rise up and leave her in unutterable
contempt? It was the most tragic moment of her life, and her whole
personality was strung up to meet it and withstand it.

"Well, they were good letters, anyhow," said Gilbert finally;
"interesting letters," he added, as if by way of a meditative
afterthought.

It was so anti-climactic that Alma broke into an hysterical giggle,
cut short by a sob. She dropped into a chair by the table and flung
her hands over her face, laughing and sobbing softly to herself.
Gilbert rose and walked to the door, where he stood with his back to
her until she regained her self-control. Then he turned and looked
down at her quizzically.

Alma's hands lay limply in her lap, and her eyes were cast down, with
tears glistening on the long fair lashes. She felt his gaze on her.

"Can you ever forgive me, Gilbert?" she said humbly.

"I don't know that there is much to forgive," he answered. "I have
some explanations to make too and, since we're at it, we might as well
get them all over and have done with them. Two years ago I did
honestly think I was in love with Anna--at least when I was round
where she was. She had a taking way with her. But, somehow, even then,
when I wasn't with her she seemed to kind of grow dim and not count
for so awful much after all. I used to wish she was more like
you--quieter, you know, and not so sparkling. When I parted from her
that last night before I went west, I did feel very bad, and she
seemed very dear to me, but it was six weeks from that before
her--your--letter came, and in that time she seemed to have faded out
of my thoughts. Honestly, I wasn't thinking much about her at all.
Then came the letter--and it was a splendid one, too. I had never
thought that Anna could write a letter like that, and I was as pleased
as Punch about it. The letters kept coming, and I kept on looking for
them more and more all the time. I fell in love all over again--with
the writer of those letters. I thought it was Anna, but since you
wrote the letters, it must have been with you, Alma. I thought it was
because she was growing more womanly that she could write such
letters. That was why I came home. I wanted to get acquainted all over
again, before she grew beyond me altogether--I wanted to find the real
Anna the letters showed me. I--I--didn't expect this. But I don't care
if Anna is married, so long as the girl who wrote those letters isn't.
It's you I love, Alma."

He bent down and put his arm about her, laying his cheek against hers.
The little red spot where his kiss had fallen was now quite drowned
out in the colour that rushed over her face.

"If you'll marry me, Alma, I'll forgive you," he said.

A little smile escaped from the duress of Alma's lips and twitched her
dimples.

"I'm willing to do anything that will win your forgiveness, Gilbert,"
she said meekly.


Aunt Caroline's Silk Dress


Patty came in from her walk to the post office with cheeks finely
reddened by the crisp air. Carry surveyed her with pleasure. Of late
Patty's cheeks had been entirely too pale to please Carry, and Patty
had not had a very good appetite. Once or twice she had even
complained of a headache. So Carry had sent her to the office for a
walk that night, although the post office trip was usually Carry's own
special constitutional, always very welcome to her after a weary day
of sewing on other people's pretty dresses.

Carry never sewed on pretty dresses for herself, for the simple reason
that she never had any pretty dresses. Carry was twenty-two--and
feeling forty, her last pretty dress had been when she was a girl of
twelve, before her father had died. To be sure, there was the silk
organdie Aunt Kathleen had sent her, but that was fit only for
parties, and Carry never went to any parties.

"Did you get any mail, Patty?" she asked unexpectantly. There was
never much mail for the Lea girls.

"Yes'm," said Patty briskly. "Here's the _Weekly Advocate_, and a
patent medicine almanac with all your dreams expounded, _and_ a letter
for Miss Carry M. Lea. It's postmarked Enfield, and has a suspiciously
matrimonial look. I'm sure it's an invitation to Chris Fairley's
wedding. Hurry up and see, Caddy."

Carry, with a little flush of excitement on her face, opened her
letter. Sure enough, it contained an invitation "to be present at the
marriage of Christine Fairley."

"How jolly!" exclaimed Patty. "Of course you'll go, Caddy. You'll have
a chance to wear that lovely organdie of yours at last."

"It was sweet of Chris to invite me," said Carry. "I really didn't
expect it."

"Well, I did. Wasn't she your most intimate friend when she lived in
Enderby?"

"Oh, yes, but it is four years since she left, and some people might
forget in four years. But I might have known Chris wouldn't. Of course
I'll go."

"And you'll make up your organdie?"

"I shall have to," laughed Carry, forgetting all her troubles for a
moment, and feeling young and joyous over the prospect of a festivity.
"I haven't another thing that would do to wear to a wedding. If I
hadn't that blessed organdie I couldn't go, that's all."

"But you have it, and it will look lovely made up with a tucked skirt.
Tucks are so fashionable now. And there's that lace of mine you can
have for a bertha. I want you to look just right, you see. Enfield is
a big place, and there will be lots of grandees at the wedding. Let's
get the last fashion sheet and pick out a design right away. Here's
one on the very first page that would be nice. You could wear it to
perfection, Caddy you're so tall and slender. It wouldn't suit a plump
and podgy person like myself at all."

Carry liked the pattern, and they had an animated discussion over it.
But, in the end, Carry sighed, and pushed the sheet away from her,
with all the brightness gone out of face.

"It's no use, Patty. I'd forgotten for a few minutes, but it's all
come back now. I can't think of weddings and new dresses, when the
thought of that interest crowds everything else out. It's due next
month--fifty dollars--and I've only ten saved up. I can't make forty
dollars in a month, even if I had any amount of sewing, and you know
hardly anyone wants sewing done just now. I don't know what we shall
do. Oh, I suppose we can rent a couple of rooms in the village and
_exist_ in them. But it breaks my heart to think of leaving our old
home."

"Perhaps Mr. Kerr will let us have more time," suggested Patty, not
very hopefully. The sparkle had gone out of her face too. Patty loved
their little home as much as Carry did.

"You know he won't. He has been only too anxious for an excuse to
foreclose, this long time. He wants the land the house is on. Oh, if I
only hadn't been sick so long in the summer--just when everybody had
sewing to do. I've tried so hard to catch up, but I couldn't." Carry's
voice broke in a sob.

Patty leaned over the table and patted her sister's glossy dark hair
gently.

"You've worked too hard, dearie. You've just gone to skin and bone.
Oh, I know how hard it is! I can't bear to think of leaving this dear
old spot either. If we could only induce Mr. Kerr to give us a year's
grace! I'd be teaching then, and we could easily pay the interest and
some of the principal too. Perhaps he will if we both go to him and
coax very hard. Anyway, don't worry over it till after the wedding. I
want you to go and have a good time. You never have good times,
Carry."

"Neither do you," said Carry rebelliously. "You never have anything
that other girls have, Patty--not even pretty clothes."

"Deed, and I've lots of things to be thankful for," said Patty
cheerily. "Don't you fret about me. I'm vain enough to think I've got
some brains anyway, and I'm a-meaning to do something with them too.
Now I think I'll go upstairs and study this evening. It will be warm
enough there tonight, and the noise of the machine rather bothers me."

Patty whisked out, and Carry knew she should go to her sewing. But she
sat a long while at the table in dismal thought. She was so tired, and
so hopeless. It had been such a hard struggle, and it seemed now as if
it would all come to naught. For five years, ever since her mother's
death, Carry had supported herself and Patty by dressmaking. They had
been a hard five years of pinching and economizing and going without,
for Enderby was only a small place, and there were two other
dressmakers. Then there was always the mortgage to devour everything.
Carry had kept it at bay till now, but at last she was conquered. She
had had typhoid fever in the spring and had not been able to work for
a long time. Indeed, she had gone to work before she should. The
doctor's bill was yet unpaid, but Dr. Hamilton had told her to take
her time. Carry knew she would not be pressed for that, and next year
Patty would be able to help her. But next year would be too late. The
dear little home would be lost then.

When Carry roused herself from her sad reflections, she saw a crumpled
note lying on the floor. She picked it up and absently smoothed it
out. Seeing Patty's name at the top she was about to lay it aside
without reading it, but the lines were few, and the sense of them
flashed into Carry's brain. The note was an invitation to Clare
Forbes's party! The Lea girls had known that the Forbes girls were
going to give a party, but they had not expected that Patty would be
invited. Of course, Clare Forbes was in Patty's class at school and
was always very nice and friendly with her. But then the Forbes set
was not the Lea set.

Carry ran upstairs to Patty's room. "Patty, you dropped this on the
floor. I couldn't help seeing what it was. Why didn't you tell me
Clare had invited you?"

"Because I knew I couldn't go, and I thought you would feel badly over
that. Caddy, I wish you hadn't seen it."

"Oh, Patty, I _do_ wish you could go to the party. It was so sweet of
Clare to invite you, and perhaps she will be offended if you don't
go--she won't understand. Clare Forbes isn't a girl whose friendship
is to be lightly thrown away when it is offered."

"I know that. But, Caddy dear, it is impossible. I don't think that I
have any foolish pride about clothes, but you know it is out of the
question to think of going to Clare Forbes's party in my last winter's
plaid dress, which is a good two inches too short and skimpy in
proportion. Putting my own feelings aside, it would be an insult to
Clare. There, don't think any more about it."

But Carry did think about it. She lay awake half the night wondering
if there might not be some way for Patty to go to that party. She knew
it was impossible, unless Patty had a new dress, and how could a new
dress be had? Yet she did so want Patty to go. Patty never had any
good times, and she was studying so hard. Then, all at once, Carry
thought of a way by which Patty might have a new dress. She had been
tossing restlessly, but now she lay very still, staring with wide-open
eyes at the moonlit window, with the big willow boughs branching
darkly across it. Yes, it was a way, but could she? _Could_ she? Yes,
she could, and she would. Carry buried her face in her pillow with a
sob and a gulp. But she had decided what must be done, and how it must
be done.

"Are you going to begin on your organdie today?" asked Patty in the
morning, before she started for school.

"I must finish Mrs. Pidgeon's suit first," Carry answered. "Next week
will be time enough to think about my wedding garments."

She tried to laugh and failed. Patty thought with a pang that Carry
looked horribly pale and tired--probably she had worried most of the
night over the interest. "I'm so glad she's going to Chris's wedding,"
thought Patty, as she hurried down the street. "It will take her out
of herself and give her something nice to think of for ever so long."

Nothing more was said that week about the organdie, or the wedding, or
the Forbes's party. Carry sewed fiercely, and sat at her machine for
hours after Patty had gone to bed. The night before the party she said
to Patty, "Braid your hair tonight, Patty. You'll want it nice and
wavy to go to the Forbes's tomorrow night."

Patty thought that Carry was actually trying to perpetrate a weak
joke, and endeavoured to laugh. But it was a rather dreary laugh.
Patty, after a hard evening's study, felt tired and discouraged, and
she was really dreadfully disappointed about the party, although she
wouldn't have let Carry suspect it for the world.

"You're going, you know," said Carry, as serious as a judge, although
there was a little twinkle in her eyes.

"In a faded plaid two inches too short?" Patty smiled as brightly as
possible.

"Oh, no. I have a dress all ready for you." Carry opened the wardrobe
door and took out--the loveliest girlish dress of creamy organdie,
with pale pink roses scattered over it, made with the daintiest of
ruffles and tucks, with a bertha of soft creamy lace, and a girdle of
white silk. "This is for you," said Carry.

Patty gazed at the dress with horror-stricken eyes. "Caroline Lea,
_that is your organdie!_ And you've gone and made it up for _me_!
Carry Lea, what are you going to wear to the wedding?"

"Nothing. I'm not going."

"You are--you must--you shall. I won't take the organdie."

"You'll have to now, because it's made to fit you. Come, Patty dear,
I've set my heart on your going to that party. You mustn't disappoint
me--you _can't_, for what good would it do? I can never wear the dress
now."

Patty realized that. She knew she might as well go to the party, but
she did not feel much pleasure in the prospect. Nevertheless, when she
was ready for it the next evening, she couldn't help a little thrill
of delight. The dress was so pretty, and dainty, and becoming.

"You look sweet," exclaimed Carry admiringly. "There, I hear the
Browns' carriage. Patty, I want you to promise me this--that you'll
not let any thought of me, or my not going to the wedding, spoil your
enjoyment this evening. I gave you the dress that you might have a
good time, so don't make my gift of no effect."

"I'll try," promised Patty, flying downstairs, where her next-door
neighbours were waiting for her.

At two o'clock that night Carry was awakened to see Patty bending over
her, flushed and radiant. Carry sat sleepily up. "I hope you had a
good time," she said.

"I had--oh, I had--but I didn't waken you out of your hard-earned
slumbers at this wee sma' hour to tell you that. Carry, I've thought
of a way for you to go to the wedding. It just came to me at supper.
Mrs. Forbes was sitting opposite to me, and her dress suggested it.
You must make over Aunt Caroline's silk dress."

"Nonsense," said Carry, a little crossly; even sweet-tempered people
are sometimes cross when they are wakened up for--as it
seemed--nothing.

"It's good plain sense. Of course, you must make it over and--"

"Patty Lea, you're crazy. I wouldn't dream of wearing that hideous
thing. Bright green silk, with huge yellow brocade flowers as big as
cabbages all over it! I think I see myself in it."

"Caddy, listen to me. You know there's enough of that black lace of
mother's for the waist, and the big black lace shawl of Grandmother
Lea's will do for the skirt. Make it over--"

"A plain slip of the silk," gasped Carry, her quick brain seizing on
all the possibilities of the plan. "Why didn't I think of it before?
It will be just the thing, the greens and yellow will be toned down to
a nice shimmer under the black lace. And I'll make cuffs of black
velvet with double puffs above--and just cut out a wee bit at the
throat with a frill of lace and a band of black velvet ribbon around
my neck. Patty Lea, it's an inspiration."

Carry was out of bed by daylight the next morning and, while Patty
still slumbered, she mounted to the garret, and took Aunt Caroline's
silk dress from the chest where it had lain forgotten for three
years. Carry held it up at arm's length, and looked at it with
amusement.

"It is certainly ugly, but with the lace over it it will look very
different. There's enough of it, anyway, and that skirt is stiff
enough to stand alone. Poor Aunt Caroline, I'm afraid I wasn't
particularly grateful for her gift at the time, but I really am now."

Aunt Caroline, who had given the dress to Carry three years before,
was, an old lady of eighty, the aunt of Carry's father. She had once
possessed a snug farm but in an evil hour she had been persuaded to
deed it to her nephew, Edward Curry, whom she had brought up. Poor
Aunt Caroline had lived to regret this step, for everyone in Enderby
knew that Edward Curry and his wife had repaid her with ingratitude
and greed.

Carry, who was named for her, was her favourite grandniece and often
went to see her, though such visits were coldly received by the
Currys, who always took especial care never to leave Aunt Caroline
alone with any of her relatives. On one occasion, when Carry was
there, Aunt Caroline had brought out this silk dress.

"I'm going to give this to you, Carry," she said timidly. "It's a good
silk, and not so very old. Mr. Greenley gave it to me for a birthday
present fifteen years ago. Maybe you can make it over for yourself."

Mrs. Edward, who was on duty at the time, sniffed disagreeably, but
she said nothing. The dress was of no value in her eyes, for the
pattern was so ugly and old-fashioned that none of her smart daughters
would have worn it. Had it been otherwise, Aunt Caroline would
probably not have been allowed to give it away.

Carry had thanked Aunt Caroline sincerely. If she did not care much
for the silk, she at least prized the kindly motive behind the gift.
Perhaps she and Patty laughed a little over it as they packed it away
in the garret. It was so very ugly, but Carry thought it was sweet of
Aunt Caroline to have given her something. Poor old Aunt Caroline had
died soon after, and Carry had not thought about the silk dress again.
She had too many other things to think of, this poor worried Carry.

After breakfast Carry began to rip the skirt breadths apart. Snip,
snip, went her scissors, while her thoughts roamed far afield--now
looking forward with renewed pleasure to Christine's wedding, now
dwelling dolefully on the mortgage. Patty, who was washing the dishes,
knew just what her thoughts were by the light and shadow on her
expressive face.

"Why!--what?" exclaimed Carry suddenly. Patty wheeled about to see
Carry staring at the silk dress like one bewitched. Between the silk
and the lining which she had just ripped apart was a twenty-dollar
bill, and beside it a sheet of letter paper covered with writing in a
cramped angular hand, both secured very carefully to the silk.

"Carry Lea!" gasped Patty.

With trembling fingers Carry snipped away the stitches that held the
letter, and read it aloud.

    "My dear Caroline," it ran, "I do not know when you will find
    this letter and this money, but when you do it belongs to you.
    I have a hundred dollars which I always meant to give you
    because you were named for me. But Edward and his wife do not
    know I have it, and I don't want them to find out. They would
    not let me give it to you if they knew, so I have thought of
    this way of getting it to you. I have sewed five twenty-dollar
    bills under the lining of this skirt, and they are all yours,
    with your Aunt Caroline's best love. You were always a good
    girl, Carry, and you've worked hard, and I've given Edward
    enough. Just take this money and use it as you like.

                                   "Aunt Caroline Greenley."


"Carry Lea, are we both dreaming?" gasped Patty.

With crimson cheeks Carry ripped the other breadths apart, and there
were the other four bills. Then she slipped down in a little heap on
the sofa cushions and began to cry--happy tears of relief and
gladness.

He did not need incentives. Wanted to return health to the Father but
he knew that his situation was desperate, that only a miracle could
save him, and he did not believe in miracles.

Humanely, meanwhile, knew he could and soon. Did not want to bleed
the patient because he was too weak, but gave the strongest and
best-known drugs for these cases.

In order to prevent or to cede to the inflammation of the membranes
of the head, put him in a caustic back together to the neck, and
he used a lever to draw blood and heat to the extremities.

All, however, was in vain.

The news of the illness of Father ran away by the place and reached the
ears of Doña Luz , who came to see him instantly. Who knows the
strange and sad thoughts that torment Doña Luz, when he entered
the room where the father was in bed in the room she had occupied
it until she married and where he slept for more than twelve years?

Silent and serious doña Luz came to the bedside. There, with his head
lifted and supported by several pillows, was the Father without
any sign of knowledge. The eyes as asleep, environments eyelids, the
tongue moves.

Maybe I felt, saw and understood yet, but had no means of communicating
their feelings due to lack of muscle strength. Long time he
looked doña Luz without saying word. Finally broke into bitter weeping.
Then sat in a chair in the darkest corner of the bedroom, and remained
silent and crying, and tried to forget his presence there. With the
turmoil of the three attendants of the patient, there was a time when
they left him alone with Ms light. She then rose from his seat, and
look again with peer, with obstinacy, with invincible attraction,
as when the traveler is on the brink of an abyss the abyss looks that
attracted him, and anxious to see what's what deep and dark in her
womb. doña Luz Tears gushed with greater abundance then. Believed,
as ever, with more vehemence than ever, that the man was dead and his
Christ appeared. Imagined, or was in effect, that the Father, still,
felt and understood it back in and looked in an effort to dominate
even with the brilliance of will, nerve and muscle inert no longer
obey him. Understood, finally, that the look of the supplicant was
sick, love, sadly sweet. For an irresistible impulse, deeply moved,
almost without realizing it, without hesitation and without thinking
too, as it does not hesitate or think what moves driven by a fatal
Doña Luz approached gently to the face of the Father, and placed in the
mouth macilenta his forehead, and then sleeping in their
eyelids, and then in her mouth, and contracted, and kissed with fervent
devotion, as one who kisses relics. It was more Doña Luz. Exhale a woe!
Acute fainted and fell on the floor. The father remained motionless
as before. Don Anselmo, D. Acisclo Ramón and went away. - What nonsense!
- Said Don Anselmo -.

What we have left here alone with this lady? This lady is very vehement,
and should not be here. In addition, the patient needs solitude. Doña
Luz was recovered a little, and resisted the last words of Mr Anselmo,
who was able to hear and understand well, Father left the room. Three
hours later Fr Enrique had ceased to exist.

Rare is the man whose memory survives long years of death. The
time just to grief, the body consumes the earth and oblivion
swallows memories.

But always or almost always, a little death occurs for every man
the time of greatest indulgence, affection and estimate that the
world gives.

Those who are unaware of the strong as insignificant, think of him
when he died, because death makes it more worthy of commemoration
of his life; _realiza its esencia_, as the philosophers to fashion:
those who envied him lay the envy, the you hated hatred, those who
were tired of seeing inwardly rejoice that you no longer see, and
for the joy of relief, and avoid coming at night, in pain, pulling
on the feet, making him the highest praise, all of their flaws
disappear anytime soon, as if sinking into the grave, and only see
their perfections in resolution, the dead are dying reconciles with
almost all mankind, so that it always goes away and leaves inherit
something: if not fifth and palaces, one for begging in the sun.

Either way, with the death of the Father, from whom, except the
places, and nobody did Villafría case, there was a place around the
resurgence of enthusiasm and affection towards him. Came to admire
and to celebrate a thousand times more than in the days of their
arrival. We just had the same treaty, vulgar imagination could invent
and fantasize at will. Their virtues were weighted. Were brought to
light many works of mercy that he indeed did.

Bordeaux is the simple story of his death with a thousand details
that played in the marvelous.

Beatas assumed that it was the same Father announced the exact day and
hour of his glorious transit, and many credited that he had died in the
odor of sanctity, and that gift should try to canonize Acisclo sent
to Rome for this purpose a file Clavet well.

Some skeptics of the place wanted to imply that all that was said to
flatter Acisclo Don, who really regretted the death of nephew and
praised in all the tones that he could use.

Otherwise, disbelief and gullible, or by making a chorus D. Acisclo
either because they feel, all agreed that the dead had been what is
called a beautiful subject, full of kindness and discretion, and
even holy, understanding each other's holiness in their own way.

No one, however, cried with more tenderness, had more serious penalty
for the death of Fr Enrique that the person knew or believed to have
evidence that he was not holy at all.

Doña Luz during the early days was desolate. Built up unique brooding
penalty.

On the one hand some pride when he returned to believe that she had
instilled a passion killer, and then the horror it caused such
pride, otherwise the confused and vague remorse suspicion that she
instinctively abhorrent, without reflection, birth had caused
and done that before so lost in soul and blissfully quiet, and finally
everything was clear that their dream of vanity.

Is not Ms Luz could have forged a novel? What the Father had told him
to believe in love? He had died of love or stroke? The romantic, the
sentimental was she who kissed him madly when expired.

"If I have been lighter, the watermelon and extravagant?

If I must have been love with the monk, who believed in me but not
with paternal affection, innocent and simple? ". Doña Luz Al ruminate
and filled with shame and trembling like a azogue and is angry with
herself, tried criminal, crazy and up infidel. While this was happening
in the spirit of Doña Luz, gift Acisclo divided among their children
or keep for themselves and the few poor articles that Father had left,
and that more had to be preserved as sacred by the memory
that they had little worth. In this partition reserved D. Doña Luz
Acisclo for the few books that the friar had. There was unaware D.
Acisclo the father was writing a book until he thought it might give
the appearance, although it had been incomplete. To get the manuscript,
he found, and considering that the only two people capable of
understanding in place what he called a _monserga_ were D.

Anselmo and Doña Luz, and D. Anselmo did not appreciate being wicked
as well as the _monserga_ Doña Luz, who was a believer, do not hesitate
to bring the manuscript to doña Luz, even without opening its
pages, because it hampered the black, as accounts were not winning
and he left reaching in its favor.

Doña Luz received the manuscript of the revered Father, and not
well D.

Acisclo left alone, he opened with eager curiosity and began to read.

In his impatience hojeaba and walked all the pages, devouring its contents
on the fly, trying to understand the whole, and then leaving to read
everything carefully. A bit of browsing, was doña Luz with loose leaves.
His look was fixed on them. The heart told him to shut something very
interesting. Then to read the break, with interruptions, with frequent
interruptions, because the tears in their eyes crowded and cegaba and
not consenting to read. In each of these inevitable interruptions in
a low voice as if afraid to be heard, interspersed with words of
grief, exclaimed Dona Luz: - It was true.

It was true. I loved my God! How much, how much they loved me! In
the latter, and then beyond what we know, the day before his death,
Fr Henry had written the following, Doña Luz also read: "These
pages, unless the trait or burn, Iran invariably, after I die, at
her beautiful hands.

Even then I am not ashamed that she knows my love. Sorry, my God, my
new fault. I want her to know. In what the know and that may disturb
the peace of his noble life? She has loved me, she loves me like an
angel to love a saint, and I've loved as a man loves a woman. It would
be hypocritical if I did not reveal that angels do not deserve your
love, that I loved as loves a sinner. It is necessary for my eternal
sleep she will forgive me for having become the balm and poison
their innocent affection incentive vicious, for having fed the pure
light of her eyes that this fire of hell burns me how clean and
stain your image I have been engraved in the soul.

Although you, my God, even though you and against you, bearing the
indelible traits. All the brilliance of my will, the strength of
heaven, all the punishments of hell can not boot from there.

Doña Luz and the love of Doña Luz live immortal life in my spirit.
"When you're done reading, Doña Luz pain became more acute, the most
abundant tears came to his eyes and the sobs that seemed to drown
iban, but looks like the iris between the black clouds, a sweet
smile of triumph and gratitude for that love, which only asked for
forgiveness, and shone in the fresh red lips of a gentle lady.
nineteenth-embassy D.

Gregorio Sadness Doña Luz past few days, it was more bitter than sweet:
while not stop being sad, it was mitigated by the satisfaction he
felt doña Luz have inspired sympathy so alive, for the statement made
by the same father, she was not pretty, and the acquittal, which
it gave, after a very rigorous examination of conscience.

Doña Luz was not the fault of that love appreciation, nor of his death
that he regretted. His friendship, admiration and reverence to the
Father could not have been higher.

If Father would have inspired a more lively feeling, she had sinned
against God, against the world, against his honor and his dignity.
However, his love for D . Jaime was legitimate, correct, according
to the type and position of her, and founded, finally, causes no less
poetic love than by P. Henry, if it had been lawful, it had been
felt. In order to strengthen and magnify the causes of love poetry
that was a D. James, Doña Luz estimated high of D. Jaime to her. His
disinterest was evident. He has found hundreds of the best parties
in Madrid. Would have easily titled Women and income, just who has
searched. Don Jaime was certainly neglected by the most brilliant
weddings. Then the adored Don Jaime. AND D. Jaime, elegant, noble
family, full of future, honored and respected as a skilful and
courageous captain and soldier, proud to be one woman who gave her
name and his hand.

D. Jaime also was still young, dashing and arrogant figure, discreet
and fun. The letters he wrote from Madrid Doña Luz showed her love for
the tender and loving and their wits and their wit, so well written
and thank you and that haul included. Doña Luz, therefore, in view
of the above agreed with herself that her husband was enamoradísima,
they had reason to be and to have married him, and his tenderness
for parent friendly and the tears that poured through his death,
and even the kisses that had given , were of a very different, which
in no way opposed or alter, or modify in an apex, or loosen a single
point in the bond of love and marriage to a D.

Jaime the link. And missing a few days to D. Jaime back for her.
Already he had taken home by the way, and almost had furnished. Had
already taken the title. Spouses and could be called the Marquis of
Villafría. Jaime was going to arrive within one week, and it was already
Wednesday. Doña Luz was in his room, had just returned from church
and had prayed fervently for the soul of Fr Enrique, who continually
and tender and melancholy thought, when Jane, the maid, saying: -
Madam, a stranger wants to talk to USIA. - Your name - Don Gregorio
Salinas. - I do not know him .

What look like? - Rather good as bad. Comes very decently dressed,
but on the road. It is known that just arrived.

Alice Chaos is, plump, red as a beet, and smiled as if pleased.

However, was in mourning. - Look, Jane, I have no desire to receive
visitors. Tell him I have a headache, back again if you have
something important to say that today no receipt. Juana came to the
message, and then returned with a letter put in the hands of Doña Luz.
- Don Gregorio Salinas - Juana said - I just deliver the letter,
ensuring that it will be admitted as USIA read. Said that the letter
is his credential. Doña Luz, as it took the letter and watched the
superscript, was amazed.

He acknowledged the letter from his father. The opened hastily, and
looked at the signature. It was also his father. He read the date
right away and saw that the letter was written for more than fifteen
years. The letter was laconic. No more than these words: 'Dear
daughter: The bearer of this letter will be Don Gregorio Salinas, Madrid
notary, person of my confidence. Gives full credit to what you say;
Oyelaran and atiéndele and accept and receive it without the slightest
compunction, that offers and delivers. "- Passing out that gentleman
- Doña Luz said.

Juana went looking, and D. Gregory entered the room where doña Luz
was. After completion of the usual sitting Doña Luz and its
hitherto unknown guest in comfortable seats, he spoke with sleep and
who has a lot to say, as follows: - You know that my name USIA Gregorio
Salinas. Now I am a scribe and I am not wrong goods fortune. Ventiocho
years ago I was a poor student, without a penny in my pocket, but
instead, nor fat, had no gray hair, or bald, or wrinkled, and the people
stated, USIA forgive the immodesty that I remember that I was a
nice kid, smart and funny.

This is not surprising, therefore, to be in love with my wife of one
of my outstanding merit Joaquina. Joaquina This is my wife, to serve
USIA. I love USIA and sends me a thousand respectful and
affectionate terms. - Thank you - Doña Luz said, breaking Don Gregorio
-. V. Treatment and let you call me, and also forgive me if I say
frankly that relieves her story because I'm curious. - Have V. calm
lady marchioness; have V. calm. I promise not to be tedious or
annoying. Iré al grano. Do not believe you that nothing I say is a
smoke straws.

Everything you need to V. becomes aware. - Come, follow V., and again
to forgive my interruption. - Well, as I was saying - continued D.
Gregory - My wife is now a matronaza guapetona still fresh and although
the years do not go in vain. Five children has given me five dollars.
All orders are V., Mrs marquesa. Then, when the engagement was a
girl of my Joaquina the most select that walking in Madrid, and served
as a maiden lady some of the most encopetadas whose privacy was
complete and all its most intimate secrets possessed. -- And how
this lady was called - The Exma.

Ms. Countess of Fajalauza. Doña Luz, who hears a name like that for
the first time sounds in your ears, shrugged and was silent. D.
Gregory continued speaking: - Much should my wife and I to this lady.
She married us, she protected us, and she gave us the means conducive
to reach the welfare and prosperity we have come.

God will increase and we pay for glory. Well you deserve it because,
finally, if an offense committed in this naughty world was his
purgatory. The Countess was married to Mr terrible to be known today.
All you shaking, starting with his wife. He had several sets of the
callers of honor, and weighed three deaths and several injuries
on his conscience.

He was reputed as the matador, who is believed capable of killing
a kick of a mosquito that flew passed fifty yards away, and a thrust
through the very devil to be put to quarrel with him.

Add to this that the Earl was jealous as a Turk, not as much love to the
Countess, but for other reasons.

The poor Countess had not given any during eight years of marriage.
That lady was a saint, very experienced, very wise and very good
Christian. Doña visible light began to show interest in the story. Don
Gregory continued: - The Countess brought to the marriage substantial
assets.

Bad languages have in spreading the Count, to marry her, but did not
take into account your business. Nothing of love. Countess almost
married girl, excited to do so by his mother, and understand the
full significance of that step. Soon his mother died, and the orphan,
no brothers or close relatives, was alone in the world, face to
face of that tyrant, that may not be called husband and partner.

Condesa was not any reason to love and respect her husband, but loved
the cleanliness of their fame, and feared God and revered religious
and moral precepts. Nothing, as I said, we had to censor it in the
first eight years of marriage. Lived resigned as a martyr. Even had
the consolation and shelter with other women, devoting their hearts to
maternal love.

The damn link was sterile.

Fajalauza of the counts had no children. An issue of great interest
at that time claimed the presence of the Count in Lima. No one should
trust the question that mattered and there was an arch-respectable sum.
The countess was very delicate health and unable to accompany her
husband as long navigation.

The Count, after much hesitation, decided to go alone. It was, therefore,
was in Peru nearly a year and a half.

In the absence of Count Countess was not presented at meetings or in
theaters; lived quite withdrawn, but there were Galan and suitors
seek to love it.

The Countess of disdain for all. There was one, however, endowed with
so rare and bright clothes, or pretend to love so much art that he was
so discreet, smooth and seductive young man who succeeded to capture
the soul of the unhappy Countess. Contributed greatly to this result,
as always happens, the fame of the conqueror who had trouserpress.
Nothing much to women as that which it seeks the disdain for her love
of other women's fashion, young, beautiful, rich and distinguished.
In sum, and who it is, loved the Countess trouserpress, and such was
his passion to win made it despite their severe principles. These
relations were involved in the most impenetrable mystery. Joaquina
I just learned from them.

The Countess was a unique woman. Dragged by the irresistible violence
of his affection, only to see his friend, then cried as the
Magdalena, prayed, abhorrent of themselves as if they were believed
to be the most vile and despicable, and desperate for God to forgive.

In This spiritual scuffle between guilt and repentance, she was until
her husband returned. The secret had been such that nobody had
suspected that neither the slightest. The Count, however, was wary
and suspicious, and suspected somewhat since the days of his return.
Perhaps the excitement of his wife, the disgust in her trunk before
the coolness with which he received, some words, some sighing,
some woe!

whistleblower who heard him in dreams, enough to put on the track.

One night while he slept the countess, her husband took over the
key to the desk of his wife and recorded in detail as it locked.

The Countess had committed the imprudence of keeping the first letter
he wrote his mistress and the Count was able to read them. As such,
these letters did not prove the full complicity of the Countess. So
it could have been preserved, not for love of whom he wrote, but
because of vanity and testimony have been so beloved.

The letters were enough, however, that the Count had appalling scenes
with his wife. If the letters had proved him guilty, had killed the
Count. As the letters were merely an indication, the Count was
limited to harassing his wife and distrustful of her and watch her.
With a plausible excuse was brought to live at home with a spinster
sister who had, it was a fury of hell.

This woman was a spy since then, the companion, the owner, the black
shadow of the Countess. As for the trouser, named the Count
discovered by the letters, the letters cost him too expensive. The
Count, so that nobody knows and try to inquire the reason, he
sought to trouserpress and forced him to quarrel with him to the
sword, with none of the procedures and formalities of mourning.

The trouser was mortally wounded in his own home, and only a miracle
could save the surgery there. - I knew that my father haul - Doña Luz
said - but he was unaware of his opponent and the cause of the
haul .

V. continue, Mr. D. Gregorio. - I know that V. was that the gallant
Mr Marquis, his father V., follow this story bearing his name.

If any sentence is beyond me that it can hurt, even slightly, the
memory of Mr.

Marquis, I to V. since then a million excuses. Doña Luz made a gesture
and moved his head as if to indicate that the apologies were accepted
beforehand. D. Gregory continued: - The terror it inspired her husband,
monitoring the Argos in a skirt in his repentance and his own sister,
the Countess made no secret to see the Marquis. This discarded his soul,
walking time, love and so dangerous and impossible or nearly impossible
to meet, and are more easily distracted loves. A bond had been broken,
and any relationship between the Marquis and the Countess had left be
forever, if the sky had not prepared it to be a living memory of
love and the guilt of both, the one who unites and whose fate and
future should ensure both equally. - And my mother - then exclaimed
Doña Luz -, could not ever see me again since her husband returned
from Lima - Could go back to V. from afar but never hug or kiss her
or talk.

His thought, however, was always with V. - Unhappy mother mine! - The
Countess knew V. I Joaquina. Joaquina by my understanding with the
Count in all that V. mattered, the only issue that was already among
the Marquis and the Countess. You, Madam Marquise, lived first in
my home, cared for my Joaquina. Our seamstress, such Antonia
Gutierrez, who had a slip and whose son had died was the mother of V.

The gleam in his eye seemed to say:

"I've got you two unprincipled subscription hunters beautifully treed
and it's treed you're going to stay. That is what I call satisfying."

I reported the state of the case to Melissa.

"What shall we do?" I asked.

"Do?" said Melissa, snappishly. "Why, stay here till Isaac Appleby
comes out and takes that brute away? What else can we do?"

"What if he isn't at home?" I suggested.

"We'll stay here till he comes home. Oh, this is a nice predicament.
This is what comes of cushioning churches!"

"It might be worse," I said comfortingly. "Suppose the roof hadn't
been flat?"

"Call Isaac," said Melissa shortly.

I didn't fancy calling Isaac, but call him I did, and when that failed
to bring him Melissa condescended to call, too; but scream as we
might, no Isaac appeared, and that dog sat there and smiled
internally.

"It's no use," said Melissa sulkily at last. "Isaac Appleby is dead or
away."

Half an hour passed; it seemed as long as a day. The sun just boiled
down on that roof and we were nearly melted. We were dreadfully
thirsty, and the heat made our heads ache, and I could see my muslin
dress fading before my very eyes. As for the roses on my best hat--but
that was too harrowing to think about.

Then we saw a welcome sight--Isaac Appleby coming through the yard
with a hoe over his shoulder. He had probably been working in his
field at the back of the house. I never thought I should have been so
glad to see him.

"Isaac, oh, Isaac!" I called joyfully, leaning over as far as I dared.

Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over
the edge of the roof. Then he saw the dog and took in the situation.
The creature actually grinned.

"Won't you call off your dog and let us get down, Isaac?" I said
pleadingly.

Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two. Then he came slowly
forward and, before we realized what he was going to do, he took that
ladder down and laid it on the ground.

"Isaac Appleby, what do you mean?" demanded Melissa wrathfully.

Isaac folded his arms and looked up. It would be hard to say which
face was the more determined, his or the dog's. But Isaac had the
advantage in point of looks, I will say that for him.

"I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you
agrees to marry me," said Isaac solemnly.

I gasped.

"Isaac Appleby, you can't be in earnest?" I cried incredulously. "You
couldn't be so mean?"

"I am in earnest. I want a wife, and I am going to have one. You two
will stay up there, and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of
you makes up her mind to take me. You can settle it between
yourselves, and let me know when you have come to a decision."

And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house.

"The man can't mean it!" said Melissa. "He is trying to play a joke on
us."

"He does mean it," I said gloomily. "An Appleby never says anything he
doesn't mean. He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry
him."

"It won't be me, then," said Melissa in a calm sort of rage. "I won't
marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life. You
can take him. It's really you he wants, anyway; he asked you first."

I always knew that rankled with Melissa.

I thought the situation over before I said anything more. We certainly
couldn't get off that roof, and if we could, there was Julius Caesar.
The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove, and
nobody might come near it for a week. To be sure, when Melissa and I
didn't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us; but that
wouldn't be for two or three days anyhow.

Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows
propped up on her knees, looking gloomily out to sea. I was afraid I
couldn't coax her into marrying Isaac. As for me, I hadn't any real
objection to marrying him, after all, for if he was short of romance
he was good-natured and has a fat bank account; but I hated to be
driven into it that way.

"You'd better take him, Melissa," I said entreatingly. "I've had one
husband and that is enough."

"More than enough for me, thank you," said Melissa sarcastically.

"Isaac is a fine man and has a lovely house; and you aren't sure the
Kingsbridge man really means anything," I went on.

"I would rather," said Melissa, with the same awful calmness, "jump
down from this roof and break my neck, or be devoured piecemeal by
that fiend down there than marry Isaac Appleby."

It didn't seem worth while to say anything more after that. We sat
there in stony silence and the time dragged by. I was hot, hungry,
thirsty, cross; and besides, I felt that I was in a ridiculous
position, which was worse than all the rest. We could see Isaac
sitting in the shade of one of his apple trees in the front orchard
comfortably reading a newspaper. I think if he hadn't aggravated me by
doing that I'd have given in sooner. But as it was, I was determined
to be as stubborn as everybody else. We were four obstinate
creatures--Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I.

At four o'clock Isaac got up and went into the house; in a few minutes
he came out again with a basket in one hand and a ball of cord in the
other.

"I don't intend to starve you, of course, ladies," he said politely,
"I will throw this ball up to you and you can then draw up the
basket."

I caught the ball, for Melissa never turned her head. I would have
preferred to be scornful, too, and reject the food altogether; but I
was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride in my pocket and hauled
the basket up. Besides, I thought it might enable us to hold out until
some loophole of escape presented itself.

Isaac went back into the house and I unpacked the basket. There was a
bottle of milk, some bread and butter, and a pie. Melissa wouldn't
take a morsel of the food, but she was so thirsty she had to take a
drink of milk.

She tried to lift her veil--and something caught; Melissa gave it a
savage twitch, and off came veil and hat--and all her front hair!

You never saw such a sight. I'd always suspected Melissa wore a false
front, but I'd never had any proof before.

Melissa pinned on her hair again and put on her hat and drank the
milk, all without a word; but she was purple. I felt sorry for her.

And I felt sorry for Isaac when I tried to eat that bread. It was sour
and dreadful. As for the pie, it was hopeless. I tasted it, and then
threw it down to Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar, not being over
particular, ate it up. I thought perhaps it would kill him, for
anything might come of eating such a concoction. That pie was a strong
argument for Isaac. I thought a man who had to live on such cookery
did indeed need a wife and might be pardoned for taking desperate
measures to get one. I was dreadfully tired of broiling on the roof
anyhow.

But it was the thunderstorm that decided me. When I saw it coming up,
black and quick, from the northwest, I gave in at once. I had endured
a good deal and was prepared to endure more; but I had paid ten
dollars for my hat and I was not going to have it ruined by a
thunderstorm. I called to Isaac and out he came.

"If you will let us down and promise to dispose of that dog before I
come here I will marry you, Isaac," I said, "but I'll make you sorry
for it afterwards, though."

"I'll take the risk of that, Anne," he said; "and, of course, I'll
sell the dog. I won't need him when I have you."

Isaac meant to be complimentary, though you mightn't have thought so
if you had seen the face of that dog.

Isaac ordered Julius Caesar away and put up the ladder, and turned his
back, real considerately, while we climbed down. We had to go in his
house and stay till the shower was over. I didn't forget the object of
our call and I produced our subscription list at once.

"How much have you got?" asked Isaac.

"Seventy dollars and we want a hundred and fifty," I said.

"You may put me down for the remaining eighty, then," said Isaac
calmly.

The Applebys are never mean where money is concerned, I must say.

Isaac offered to drive us home when it cleared up, but I said "No." I
wanted to settle Melissa before she got a chance to talk.

On the way home I said to her:

"I hope you won't mention this to anyone, Melissa. I don't mind
marrying Isaac, but I don't want people to know how it came about."

"Oh, I won't say anything about it," said Melissa, laughing a little
disagreeably.

"Because," I said, to clinch the matter, looking significantly at her
front hair as I said it, "I have something to tell, too."

Melissa will hold her tongue.


By the Rule of Contrary


"Look here, Burton," said old John Ellis in an ominous tone of voice,
"I want to know if what that old busybody of a Mary Keane came here
today gossiping about is true. If it is--well, I've something to say
about the matter! Have you been courting that niece of Susan Oliver's
all summer on the sly?"

Burton Ellis's handsome, boyish face flushed darkly crimson to the
roots of his curly black hair. Something in the father's tone roused
anger and rebellion in the son. He straightened himself up from the
turnip row he was hoeing, looked his father squarely in the face, and
said quietly,

"Not on the sly, sir, I never do things that way. But I have been
going to see Madge Oliver for some time, and we are engaged. We are
thinking of being married this fall, and we hope you will not object."

Burton's frankness nearly took away his father's breath. Old John
fairly choked with rage.

"You young fool," he spluttered, bringing down his hoe with such
energy that he sliced off half a dozen of his finest young turnip
plants, "have you gone clean crazy? No, sir, I'll never consent to
your marrying an Oliver, and you needn't have any idea that I will."

"Then I'll marry her without your consent," retorted Burton angrily,
losing the temper he had been trying to keep.

"Oh, will you indeed! Well, if you do, out you go, and not a cent of
my money or a rod of my land do you ever get."

"What have you got against Madge?" asked Burton, forcing himself to
speak calmly, for he knew his father too well to doubt for a minute
that he meant and would do just what he said.

"She's an Oliver," said old John crustily, "and that's enough." And
considering that he had settled the matter, John Ellis threw down his
hoe and left the field in a towering rage.

Burton hoed away savagely until his anger had spent itself on the
weeds. Give up Madge--dear, sweet little Madge? Not he! Yet if his
father remained of the same mind, their marriage was out of the
question at present. And Burton knew quite well that his father would
remain of the same mind. Old John Ellis had the reputation of being
the most contrary man in Greenwood.

When Burton had finished his row he left the turnip field and went
straight across lots to see Madge and tell her his dismal story. An
hour later Miss Susan Oliver went up the stairs of her little brown
house to Madge's room and found her niece lying on the bed, her pretty
curls tumbled, her soft cheeks flushed crimson, crying as if her heart
would break.

Miss Susan was a tall, grim, angular spinster who looked like the last
person in the world to whom a love affair might be confided. But never
were appearances more deceptive than in this case. Behind her
unprepossessing exterior Miss Susan had a warm, sympathetic heart
filled to the brim with kindly affection for her pretty niece. She had
seen Burton Ellis going moodily across the fields homeward and guessed
that something had gone wrong.

"Now, dearie, what is the matter?" she said, tenderly patting the
brown head.

Madge sobbed out the whole story disconsolately. Burton's father would
not let him marry her because she was an Oliver. And, oh, what would
she do?

"Don't worry, Madge," said Miss Susan comfortingly. "I'll soon settle
old John Ellis."

"Why, what can you do?" asked Madge forlornly.

Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused.

"You'll see. I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself. He is
the most contrary man the Lord ever made. I went to school with him. I
learned how to manage him then, and I haven't forgotten how. I'm going
straight up to interview him."

"Are you sure that will do any good?" said Madge doubtfully. "If you
go to him and take Burton's and my part, won't it only make him
worse?"

"Madge, dear," said Miss Susan, busily twisting her scanty, iron-grey
hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge's
glass, "you just wait. I'm not young, and I'm not pretty, and I'm not
in love, but I've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will
have. You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something.
You'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis."

Burton had returned to the turnip field, but old John Ellis was taking
his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of
his house. Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a
cutting sarcasm contained therein, he saw a tall, angular figure
coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and
flutter of shawl and skirt.

"Old Susan Oliver, as sure as a gun," said old John with another
chuckle. "She looks mad clean through. I suppose she's coming here to
blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers. She's
been angling and scheming for it for years, but she will find who she
has to deal with. Come on, Miss Susan."

John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile.

Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them. She did
indeed look angry and disturbed. Without any preliminary greeting she
burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe's
breath.

"Look here, John Ellis, I want to know what this means. I've
discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours, who ought to be
in short trousers yet, has been courting my niece, Madge Oliver, all
summer. He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry
her. I won't have it, I tell you, and you can tell your son so. Marry
my niece indeed! A pretty pass the world is coming to! I'll never
consent to it."

Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts
thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and
taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment, but I doubt it.
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the
Ellis contrariness was roused.

"What have you got to say against my son?" he fairly shouted in his
rage. "Isn't he good enough for your girl, Susan Oliver, I'd like to
know?"

"No, he isn't," retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly.
"He's well enough in his place, but you'll please to remember, John
Ellis, that my niece is an Oliver, and the Olivers don't marry beneath
them."

Old John was furious. "Beneath them indeed! Why, woman, it is
condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece--condescension,
that is what it is. You are as poor as church mice."

"We come of good family, though," retorted Miss Susan. "You Ellises
are nobodies. Your grandfather was a hired man! And yet you have the
presumption to think you're fit to marry into an old, respectable
family like the Olivers. But talking doesn't signify. I simply won't
allow this nonsense to go on. I came here today to tell you so plump
and plain. It's your duty to stop it; if you don't I will, that's
all."

"Oh, will you?" John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and
stubbornness now. "We'll see, Miss Susan, we'll see. My son shall
marry whatever girl he pleases, and I'll back him up in it--do you
hear that? Come here and tell me my son isn't good enough for your
niece indeed! I'll show you he can get her anyway."

"You've heard what I've said," was the answer, "and you'd better go by
it, that's all. I shan't stay to bandy words with you, John Ellis. I'm
going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain, and what I
want her to do, and she'll do it, I haven't a fear."

Miss Susan was halfway down the steps, but John Ellis ran to the
railing of the verandah to get the last word.

"I'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what
_he_ wants her to do, and we'll see whether she'll sooner listen to
you than to him," he shouted.

Miss Susan deigned no reply. Old John strode out to the turnip field.
Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath, but
his father's first words almost took away his breath.

"See here, Burt, I take back all I said this afternoon. I want you to
marry Madge Oliver now, and the sooner, the better. That old cat of a
Susan had the face to come up and tell me you weren't good enough for
her niece. I told her a few plain truths. Don't you mind the old
crosspatch. I'll back you up."

By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously, to hide the amused
twinkle of comprehension in his eyes. He admired Miss Susan's tactics,
but he did not say so.

"All right, Father," he answered dutifully.

When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put
on her new pink muslin, because she guessed Burton would be down that
evening.

"Oh, Auntie, how did you manage it?" cried Madge.

"Madge," said Miss Susan solemnly, but with dancing eyes, "do you know
how to drive a pig? Just try to make it go in the opposite direction
and it will bolt the way you want it. Remember that, my dear."


Fair Exchange and No Robbery


Katherine Rangely was packing up. Her chum and roommate, Edith Wilmer,
was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion
peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer.

"It does seem too provoking," said Katherine, as she tugged at an
obstinate shawl strap, "that Ned should be transferred here now, just
when I'm going away. The powers that be might have waited until
vacation was over. Ned won't know a soul here and he'll be horribly
lonesome."

"I'll do my best to befriend him, with your permission," said Edith
consolingly.

"Oh, I know. You're a special Providence, Ede. Ned will be up tonight
first thing, of course, and I'll introduce him. Try to keep the poor
fellow amused until I get back. Two months! Just fancy! And Aunt
Elizabeth won't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay
with her. Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull, too."

Then the talk drifted around to Edith's affairs. She was engaged to a
certain Sidney Keith, who was a professor in some college.

"I don't expect to see much of Sidney this summer," said Edith. "He's
writing another book. He is so terribly addicted to literature."

"How lovely," sighed Katherine, who had aspirations in that line
herself. "If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy. But
Ned is so prosaic. He doesn't care a rap for poetry, and he laughs
when I enthuse. It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up
writing seriously. He says women writers are an abomination on the
face of the earth. Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous?"

"He is very handsome, though," said Edith, with a glance at his
photograph on Katherine's dressing table. "And that is what Sid is
not. He is rather distinguished looking, but as plain as he can
possibly be."

Edith sighed. She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it
rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover.

"He has lovely eyes," said Katherine comfortingly, "and handsome men
are always vain. Even Ned is. I have to snub him regularly. But I
think you'll like him."

Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night. He was a
handsome off-handed young fellow, who seemed to admire Katherine
immensely, and be a little afraid of her into the bargain.

"Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away,"
she told him in their good-bye chat. "She is a dear girl--you'll like
her, I know. It's really too bad I have to go away now, but it can't
be helped."

"I shall be awfully lonesome," grumbled Ned. "Don't you forget to
write regularly, Kitty."

"Of course I'll write, but for pity's sake, Ned, don't call me Kitty.
It sounds so childish. Well, bye-bye, dear boy. I'll be back in two
months and then we'll have a lovely time."

       *       *       *       *       *

When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how
upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven. Harbour Hill
was noted for its beauty, but not every woman can live by scenery
alone.

"Aunt Elizabeth," said Katherine one day, "does anybody ever die in
Harbour Hill? Because it doesn't seem to me it would be any change for
them if they did."

Aunt Elizabeth's only reply to this was a shocked look.

To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds, and this
involved long tramps along the shore. On one of these occasions she
met with an adventure. The place was a remote spot far up the shore.
Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings, tucked up her skirt,
rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows, and was deep in the
absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland. She
looked anything but dignified while so employed, but under the
circumstances dignity did not matter.

Presently she heard a shout from the shore and, turning around in
dismay, she beheld a man on the rocks behind her. He was evidently
shouting at her. What on earth could the creature want?

"Come in," he called, gesticulating wildly. "You'll be in the
bottomless pit in another moment if you don't look out."

"He certainly must be a lunatic," said Katherine to herself, "or else
he's drunk. What am I to do?"

"Come in, I tell you," insisted the stranger. "What in the world do
you mean by wading out to such a place? Why, it's madness."

Katherine's indignation got the better of her fear.

"I do not think I am trespassing," she called back as icily as
possible.

The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all. He came down to the
very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly. He was
dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles. He did
not look like a lunatic, and he did not seem to be drunk.

"I implore you to come in," he said earnestly. "You must be standing
on the very brink of the bottomless pit."

He is certainly off his balance, thought Katherine. He must be some
revivalist who has gone insane on one point. I suppose I'd better go
in. He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I don't.

She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens. The
stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks.

"I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in
that fashion for a handful of seaweeds," he said.

"I haven't the faintest idea what you mean," said Miss Rangely. "You
don't look crazy, but you talk as if you were."

"Do you mean to say you don't know that what the people hereabouts
call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point--the most
dangerous spot along the whole coast?"

"No, I didn't," said Katherine, horrified. She remembered now that
Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along
shore, but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it
to be in quite another direction. "I am a stranger here."

"Well, I hardly thought you'd be foolish enough to be out there if you
knew," said the other in mollified accents. "The place ought not to be
left without warning, anyhow. It is the most careless thing I ever
heard of. There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever
been able to find the bottom of it. A person who got into it would
never be heard of again. The rocks there form an eddy that sucks
everything right down."

"I am very grateful to you for calling me in," said Katherine humbly.
"I had no idea I was in such danger."

"You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds, I see," said the unknown.

But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds. She suddenly
realized what she must look like--bare feet, draggled skirts, dripping
arms. And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was
undoubtedly a gentleman. Oh, if he would only go and give her a chance
to put on her shoes and stockings!

Nothing seemed further from his intentions. When Katherine had picked
up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward, he walked beside her,
still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly
accustomed to walking with barefooted young women. In spite of
herself, Katherine couldn't help listening to him, for he managed to
invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest. She finally decided that
as he didn't seem to mind her bare feet, she wouldn't either.

He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly
amateurish beside him. He looked over her specimens and pointed out
the valuable ones. He explained the best method of preserving and
mounting them, and told her of other and less dangerous places along
the shore where she might get some new varieties.

When they came in sight of Harbour Hill, Katherine began to wonder
what on earth she would do with him. It wasn't exactly permissible to
snub a man who had practically saved your life, but, on the other
hand, the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour
Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman
discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated.

The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself. He said that he must really
go back or he would be late for dinner, lifted his hat politely, and
departed. Katherine waited until he was out of sight, then sat down on
the sand and put on her shoes and stockings.

"Who on earth can he be?" she said to herself. "And where have I seen
him before? There was certainly something familiar about his
appearance. He is very nice, but he must have thought me crazy. I
wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill."

The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith
awaiting her.

"I see Ned quite often," wrote the latter, "and I think he is
perfectly splendid. You are a lucky girl, Kate. But oh, do you know
that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill, too, or at least quite near
it? I had a letter from him yesterday. He has gone down there to spend
his vacation, because it is so quiet, and to finish up some horrid
scientific book he is working at. He's boarding at some little
farmhouse up the shore. I've written to him today to hunt you up and
consider himself introduced to you. I think you'll like him, for he's
just your style."

Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith's card was brought up to her that
evening and went down to meet him. Her companion of the morning rose
to meet her.

"You!" he said.

"Yes, me," said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically. "You
didn't expect it, did you? I was sure I had seen you before--only it
wasn't you but your photograph."

When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to
call again. He did not fail to avail himself of it--in fact, he became
a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa. Katherine wrote all about it to
Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience.

They got on capitally together. They went on long expeditions up shore
after seaweeds, and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a
collection of the Harbour Hill flora. This involved more long,
companionable expeditions. Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor
Keith found time to work on his book, but as he made no reference to
the subject, neither did she.

Once in a while, when she had time to think of them, she wondered how
Ned and Edith were getting on. At first Edith's letters had been full
of Ned, but in her last two or three she had said little about him.
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled.
Edith wrote back and said, "What nonsense." She and Ned were as good
friends as ever, but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and
wasn't so dependent on her society, etc.

Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith. It was
getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more.
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she
mentioned this fact inconsequently. The professor prodded the harmless
dust with his cane. Well, he supposed she would find a return to work
pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends
again.

"I'm dying to see Edith," said Katherine.

"And Ned?" suggested Professor Keith.

"Oh yes. Ned, of course," assented Katherine without enthusiasm. There
didn't seem to be anything more to say. One cannot talk everlastingly
about ferns, so they got up and went home.

Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night.
Then she went to bed and cried.

When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve
of her departure from Harbour Hill, he looked like a man who was being
led to execution without benefit of clergy. But he kept himself well
in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects. After all, it was
Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye.
She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly
stopped short, and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver.

The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him. His hat
dropped under their feet and was trampled on, but I doubt if Professor
Keith knows the difference to this day, for he was fully absorbed in
kissing Katherine's hair. When she became cognizant of this fact, she
drew herself away.

"Oh, Sidney, don't!--think of Edith! I feel like a traitor."

"Do you think she would care very much if I--if you--if we--"
hesitated the professor.

"Oh, it would break her heart," cried Katherine with convincing
earnestness. "I know it would--and Ned's too. They must never know."

The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat. He was
a long time finding it, and when he did he went softly to the door.
With his hand on the knob, he paused and looked back.

"Good-bye, Miss Rangely," he said softly.

But Katherine, whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge,
did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone.

       *       *       *       *       *

Katharine felt that life was stale, flat and unprofitable when she
alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening. She was
not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her. She
walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered
her room unannounced. Edith, who was lying on the bed, sprang up with
a surprised greeting. It was too dark to be sure, but Katherine had an
uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying, and her heart
quaked guiltily. Could Edith have suspected anything?

"Why, we didn't think you'd be up till the 8:30 train, and Ned and I
were going to meet you."

"I found I could catch an earlier train, so I took it," said
Katherine, as she dropped listlessly into a chair. "I am tired to
death and I have such a headache. I can't see anyone tonight, not even
Ned."

"You poor dear," said Edith sympathetically, beginning a search for
the cologne. "Lie down on the bed and I'll bathe your poor head. Did
you have a good time at Harbour Hill? And how did you leave Sid? Did
he say anything about coming up?"

"Oh, he was quite well," said Katherine wearily. "I didn't hear him
say if he intended to come up or not. There, thanks--that will do
nicely."

After Edith had gone down, Katherine tossed about restlessly. She knew
Ned had come and she did not want to see him. But, after all, it was
only putting off the evil day, and it was treating him rather
shabbily. She would go down for a minute.

There were two doors to the parlour, and Katherine went by way of the
library one, over which a portiere was hanging. Her hand was lifted to
draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement.

A woman was crying in the room beyond. It was Edith--and what was she
saying?

"Oh, Ned, it is all perfectly dreadful! I couldn't look Catherine in
the face when she came home. I'm so ashamed of myself and I never
meant to be so false. We must never let her suspect for a minute."

"It's pretty rough on a fellow," said another voice--Ned's voice--in a
choked sort of a way. "Upon my word, Edith, I don't see how I'm going
to keep it up."

"You must," sobbed Edith. "It would break her heart--and Sidney's too.
We must just make up our minds to forget each other, Ned, and you must
marry Katherine."

Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping
and she went away noiselessly. She did not look in the least like a
person who has received a mortal blow, and she had forgotten her
headache altogether.

When Edith came up half an hour later, she found the worn-out invalid
sitting up and reading a novel.

"How is your headache, dear?" she asked, carefully keeping her face
turned away from Katherine.

"Oh, it's all gone," said Miss Rangely cheerfully.

"Why didn't you come down then? Ned was here."

"Well, Ede, I did go down, but I thought I wasn't particularly wanted,
so I came back."

Edith faced her friend in dismay, forgetful of swollen lids and
tear-stained cheeks.

"Katherine!"

"Don't look so conscience stricken, my dear child. There is no harm
done."

"You heard--"

"Some surprising speeches. So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love
with one another?"

"Oh, Katherine," sobbed Edith, "we--we--couldn't help it--but it's all
over. Oh, don't be angry with me!"

"Angry? My dear, I'm delighted."

"Delighted?"

"Yes, you dear goose. Can't you guess, or must I tell you? Sidney and
I did the very same, and had just such a melancholy parting last night
as I suspect you and Ned had tonight."

"Katherine!"

"Yes, it's quite true. And of course we made up our minds to sacrifice
ourselves on the altar of duty and all that. But now, thank goodness,
there is no need of such wholesale immolation. So just let's forgive
each other."

"Oh," sighed Edith happily, "it is almost too good to be true."

"It is really providentially ordered, isn't it?" said Katherine. "Ned
and I would never have got on together in the world, and you and
Sidney would have bored each other to death. As it is, there will be
four perfectly happy people instead of four miserable ones. I'll tell
Ned so tomorrow."


Four Winds


Alan Douglas threw down his pen with an impatient exclamation. It was
high time his next Sunday's sermon was written, but he could not
concentrate his thoughts on his chosen text. For one thing he did not
like it and had selected it only because Elder Trewin, in his call of
the evening before, had hinted that it was time for a good stiff
doctrinal discourse, such as his predecessor in Rexton, the Rev. Jabez
Strong, had delighted in. Alan hated doctrines--"the soul's
staylaces," he called them--but Elder Trewin was a man to be reckoned
with and Alan preached an occasional sermon to please him.

"It's no use," he said wearily. "I could have written a sermon in
keeping with that text in November or midwinter, but now, when the
whole world is reawakening in a miracle of beauty and love, I can't do
it. If a northeast rainstorm doesn't set in before next Sunday, Mr.
Trewin will not have his sermon. I shall take as my text instead,
'The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds has
come.'"

He rose and went to his study window, outside of which a young vine
was glowing in soft tender green tints, its small dainty leaves
casting quivering shadows on the opposite wall where the portrait of
Alan's mother hung. She had a fine, strong, sweet face; the same face,
cast in a masculine mould, was repeated in her son, and the
resemblance was striking as he stood in the searching evening
sunshine. The black hair grew around his forehead in the same way; his
eyes were steel blue, like hers, with a similar expression, half
brooding, half tender, in their depths. He had the mobile, smiling
mouth of the picture, but his chin was deeper and squarer, dented with
a dimple which, combined with a certain occasional whimsicality of
opinion and glance, had caused Elder Trewin some qualms of doubt
regarding the fitness of this young man for his high and holy
vocation. The Rev. Jabez Strong had never indulged in dimples or
jokes; but then, as Elder Trewin, being a just man, had to admit, the
Rev. Jabez Strong had preached many a time and oft to more empty pews
than full ones, while now the church was crowded to its utmost
capacity on Sundays and people came to hear Mr. Douglas who had not
darkened a church door for years. All things considered, Elder Trewin
decided to overlook the dimple. There was sure to be some drawback in
every minister.

Alan from his study looked down on all the length of the Rexton
valley, at the head of which the manse was situated, and thought that
Eden might have looked so in its innocence, for all the orchards were
abloom and the distant hills were tremulous and aerial in springtime
gauzes of pale purple and pearl. But in any garden, despite its
beauty, is an element of tameness and domesticity, and Alan's eyes,
after a moment's delighted gazing, strayed wistfully off to the north
where the hills broke away into a long sloping lowland of pine and
fir. Beyond it stretched the wide expanse of the lake, flashing in the
molten gold and crimson of evening. Its lure was irresistible. Alan
had been born and bred beside a faraway sea and the love of it was
strong in his heart--so strong that he knew he must go back to it
sometime. Meanwhile, the great lake, mimicking the sea in its vast
expanse and the storms that often swept over it, was his comfort and
solace. As often as he could he stole away to its wild and lonely
shore, leaving the snug bounds of cultivated home lands behind him
with something like a sense of relief. Down there by the lake was a
primitive wilderness where man was as naught and man-made doctrines
had no place. There one might walk hand in hand with nature and so
come very close to God. Gracious Lord, we can not bring him out, where

King.

On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore
road. She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the
needles for a cushion. Yet the thought came into Alan's mind that she
was spying on him and, although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy, it
continued to lurk there.

For a week he avoided the shore, but there came a day when its
inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly. It was a warm,
windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous, the lake misty and
blue. There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed
as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it. The
Captain's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was
generally anchored and, though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs
made Alan's heart beat expectantly, he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver. He
was on the point of turning homeward, with an unreasoning sense of
disappointment, when one of Lynde's dogs broke down through the hedge
of spruces, barking loudly.

Alan looked for Lynde to follow, but she did not, and he speedily saw
that there was something unusual about the dog's behaviour. The animal
circled around him, still barking excitedly, then ran off for a short
distance, stopped, barked again, and returned, repeating the
manoeuvre. It was plain that he wanted Alan to follow him, and it
occurred to the young minister that the dog's mistress must be in
danger of some kind. Instantly he set off after him; and the dog, with
a final sharp bark of satisfaction, sprang up the low bank into the
spruces.

Alan followed him across the peninsula and then along the further
shore, which rapidly grew steep and high. Half a mile down the cliffs
were rocky and precipitous, while the beach beneath them was heaped
with huge boulders. Alan followed the dog along one of the narrow
paths with which the barrens abounded until nearly a mile from Four
Winds. Then the animal halted, ran to the edge of the cliff and
barked.

It was an ugly-looking place where a portion of the soil had evidently
broken away recently, and Alan stepped cautiously out to the brink and
looked down. He could not repress an exclamation of dismay and alarm.

A few feet below him Lynde Oliver was lying on a mass of mossy soil
which was apparently on the verge of slipping over a sloping shelf of
rock, below which was a sheer drop of thirty feet to the cruel
boulders below. The extreme danger of her position was manifest at a
glance; the soil on which she lay was stationary, yet it seemed as if
the slightest motion on her part would send it over the brink.

Lynde lay movelessly; her face was white, and both fear and appeal
were visible in her large dilated eyes. Yet she was quite calm and a
faint smile crossed her pale lips as she saw the man and the dog.

"Good faithful Pat, so you did bring help," she said.

"But how can I help you, Miss Oliver?" said Alan hoarsely. "I cannot
reach you--and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would send
that broken earth over the brink."

"I fear it would. You must go back to Four Winds and get a rope."

"And leave you here alone--in such danger?"

"Pat will stay with me. Besides, there is nothing else to do. You will
find a rope in that little house where you put the water for Emily.
Father and Emily are away. I think I am quite safe here if I don't
move at all."

Alan's own common sense told him that, as she said, there was nothing
else to do and, much as he hated to leave her alone thus, he realized
that he must lose no time in doing it.

"I'll be back as quickly as possible," he said hurriedly.

Alan had been a noted runner at college and his muscles had not
forgotten their old training. Yet it seemed to him an age ere he
reached Four Winds, secured the rope, and returned. At every flying
step he was haunted by the thought of the girl lying on the brink of
the precipice and the fear that she might slip over it before he could
rescue her. When he reached the scene of the accident he dreaded to
look over the broken edge, but she was lying there safely and she
smiled when she saw him--a brave smile that softened her tense white
face into the likeness of a frightened child's.

"If I drop the rope down to you, are you strong enough to hold to it
while the earth goes and then draw yourself up the slope hand over
hand?" asked Alan anxiously.

"Yes," she answered fearlessly.

Alan passed down one end of the rope and then braced himself firmly to
hold it, for there was no tree near enough to be of any assistance.
The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it, for at her
first movement the soil beneath her slipped away. Alan's heart
sickened; what if she went with it? Could she cling to the rope while
he drew her up?

Then he saw she was still safe on the sloping shelf. Carefully and
painfully she drew herself to her knees and, dinging to the rope,
crept up the rock hand over hand. When she came within his reach he
grasped her arms and lifted her up into safety beside him.

"Thank God," he said, with whiter lips than her own.

For a few moments Lynde sat silent on the sod, exhausted with fright
and exertion, while her dog fawned on her in an ecstasy of joy.
Finally she looked up into Alan's anxious face and their eyes met. It
was something more than the physical reaction that suddenly flushed
the girl's cheeks. She sprang lithely to her feet.

"Can you walk back home?" Alan asked.

"Oh, yes, I am all right now. It was very foolish of me to get into
such a predicament. Father and Emily went down the lake in the yacht
this afternoon and I started out for a ramble. When I came here I saw
some junebells growing right out on the ledge and I crept out to
gather them. I should have known better. It broke away under me and
the more I tried to scramble back the faster it slid down, carrying me
with it. I thought it would go right over the brink"--she gave a
little involuntary shudder--"but just at the very edge it stopped. I
knew I must lie very still or it would go right over. It seemed like
days. Pat was with me and I told him to go for help, but I knew there
was no one at home--and I was horribly afraid," she concluded with
another shiver. "I never was afraid in my life before--at least not
with that kind of fear."

"You have had a terrible experience and a narrow escape," said Alan
lamely. He could think of nothing more to say; his usual readiness of
utterance seemed to have failed him.

"You saved my life," she said, "you and Pat--for doggie must have his
share of credit."

"A much larger share than mine," said Alan, smiling. "If Pat had not
come for me, I would not have known of your danger. What a magnificent
fellow he is!"

"Isn't he?" she agreed proudly. "And so is Laddie, my other dog. He
went with Father today. I love my dogs more than people." She looked
at him with a little defiance in her eyes. "I suppose you think that
terrible."

"I think many dogs are much more lovable--and worthy of love--than
many people," said Alan, laughing.

How childlike she was in some ways! That trace of defiance--it was so
like a child who expected to be scolded for some wrong attitude of
mind. And yet there were moments when she looked the tall proud queen.
Sometimes, when the path grew narrow, she walked before him, her hand
on the dog's head. Alan liked this, since it left him free to watch
admiringly the swinging grace of her step and the white curves of her
neck beneath the thick braid of hair, which today was wound about her
head. When she dropped back beside him in the wider spaces, he could
only have stolen glances at her profile, delicately, strongly cut,
virginal in its soft curves, childlike in its purity. Once she looked
around and caught his glance; again she flushed, and something strange
and exultant stirred in Alan's heart. It was as if that maiden blush
were the involuntary, unconscious admission of some power he had over
her--a power which her hitherto unfettered spirit had never before
felt. The cold indifference he had seen in her face at their first
meeting was gone, and something told him it was gone forever.

When they came in sight of Four Winds they saw two people walking up
the road from the harbour and a few further steps brought them face to
face with Captain Anthony Oliver and his old housekeeper.

The Captain's appearance was a fresh surprise to Alan. He had expected
to meet a rough, burly sailor, loud of voice and forbidding of manner.
Instead, Captain Anthony was a tall, well-built man of perhaps fifty.
His face, beneath its shock of iron-grey hair, was handsome but wore a
somewhat forbidding expression, and there was something in it, apart
from line or feature, which did not please Alan. He had no time to
analyze this impression, for Lynde said hurriedly, "Father, this is
Mr. Douglas. He has just done me a great service."

She briefly explained her accident; when she had finished, the Captain
turned to Alan and held out his hand, a frank smile replacing the
rather suspicious and contemptuous scowl which had previously
overshadowed it.

"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Douglas," he said cordially. "You must
come up to the house and let me thank you at leisure. As a rule I'm
not very partial to the cloth, as you may have heard. In this case it
is the man, not the minister, I invite."

The front door of Four Winds opened directly into a wide,
low-ceilinged living room, furnished with simplicity and good taste.
Leaving the two men there, Lynde and the old cousin vanished, and Alan
found himself talking freely with the Captain who could, as it
appeared, talk well on many subjects far removed from Four Winds. He
was evidently a clever, self-educated man, somewhat opinionated and
given to sarcasm; he never made any references to his own past life or
experiences, but Alan discovered him to be surprisingly well read in
politics and science. Sometimes in the pauses of the conversation Alan
found the older man looking at him in a furtive way he did not like,
but the Captain was such an improvement on what he had been led to
expect that he was not inclined to be over critical. At least, this
was what he honestly thought. He did not suspect that it was because
this man was Lynde's father that he wished to think as well as
possible of him.

Presently Lynde came in. She had changed her outdoor dress, stained
with moss and soil in her fall, for a soft clinging garment of some
pale yellow material, and her long, thick braid of hair hung over her
shoulder. She sat mutely down in a dim corner and took no part in the
conversation except to answer briefly the remarks which Alan addressed
to her. Emily came in and lighted the lamp on the table. She was as
grim and unsmiling as ever, yet she cast a look of satisfaction on
Alan as she passed out. One dog lay down at Lynde's feet, the other
sat on his haunches by her side and laid his head on her lap. Rexton
and its quiet round of parish duties seemed thousands of miles away
from Alan, and he wondered a little if this were not all a dream.

When he went away the Captain invited him back.

"If you like to come, that is," he said brusquely, "and always as the
man, not the priest, remember. I don't want you by and by to be slyly
slipping in the thin end of any professional wedges. You'll waste your
time if you do. Come as man to man and you'll be welcome, for I like
you--and it's few men I like. But don't try to talk religion to me."

"I never talk religion," said Alan emphatically. "I try to live it.
I'll not come to your house as a self-appointed missionary, sir, but I
shall certainly act and speak at all times as my conscience and my
reverence for my vocation demands. If I respect your beliefs, whatever
they may be, I shall expect you to respect mine, Captain Oliver."

"Oh, I won't insult your God," said the Captain with a faint sneer.

Alan went home in a tumult of contending feelings. He did not
altogether like Captain Anthony--that was very clear to him, and yet
there was something about the man that attracted him. Intellectually
he was a worthy foeman, and Alan had often longed for such since
coming to Rexton. He missed the keen, stimulating debates of his
college days and, now there seemed a chance of renewing them, he was
eager to grasp it. And Lynde--how beautiful she was! What though she
shared--as was not unlikely--in her father's lack of belief? She could
not be essentially irreligious--that were impossible in a true woman.
Might not this be his opportunity to help her--to lead her into dearer
light? Alan Douglas was a sincere man, with himself as well as with
others, yet there are some motives that lie, in their first inception,
too deep even for the probe of self-analysis. He had not as yet the
faintest suspicion as to the real source of his interest in Lynde
Oliver--in his sudden forceful desire to be of use and service to
her--to rescue her from spiritual peril as he had that day rescued her
from bodily danger.

She must have a lonely, unsatisfying life, he thought. It is my duty
to help her if I can.

It did not then occur to him that duty in this instance wore a much
more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience.

       *       *       *       *       *

Alan did not mean to be oversoon in going back to Four Winds, but
three days later a book came to him which Captain Anthony had
expressed a wish to see. It furnished an excuse for an earlier call.
After that he went often. He always found the Captain courteous and
affable, old Emily grimly cordial, Lynde sometimes remote and demure,
sometimes frankly friendly. Occasionally, when the Captain was away in
his yacht, he went for a walk with her and her dogs along the shore or
through the sweet-smelling pinelands up the lake. He found that she
loved books and was avid for more of them than she could obtain; he
was glad to take her several and discuss them with her. She liked
history and travels best. With novels she had no patience, she said
disdainfully. She seldom spoke of herself or her past life and Alan
fancied she avoided any personal reference. But once she said
abruptly, "Why do you never ask me to go to church? I've always been
afraid you would."

"Because I do not think it would do you any good to go if you didn't
want to," said Alan gravely. "Souls should not be rudely handled any
more than bodies."

She looked at him reflectively, her finger denting her chin in a
meditative fashion she had.

"You are not at all like Mr. Strong. He always scolded me, when he got
a chance, for not going to church. I would have hated him if it had
been worthwhile. I told him one day that I was nearer to God under
these pines than I could be in any building fashioned by human hands.
He was very much shocked. But I don't want you to misunderstand me.
Father does not go to church because he does not believe there is a
God. But I know there is. Mother taught me so. I have never gone to
church because Father would not allow me, and I could not go now in
Rexton where the people talk about me so. Oh, I know they do--you know
it, too--but I do not care for them. I know I'm not like other girls.
I would like to be but I can't be--I never can be--now."

There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite
understand--a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the
circumstances that hedged her in.

"Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not
content you?" he said gently.

"But it does content me," said Lynde imperiously. "I want no other--I
wish this life to go on forever--forever, do you understand? If I were
sure that it would--if I were sure that no change would ever come to
me, I would be perfectly content. It is the fear that a change will
come that makes me wretched. Oh!" She shuddered and put her hands over
her eyes.

Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be
alone in the world. He wanted to comfort her--reassure her--but he did
not know how.

One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and,
seeing the Captain in the living room, he stepped in unannounced.
Captain Anthony was sitting by the table, his head in his hands; at
Alan's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face, blackened by a
furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence.

"What do you want here?" he said, following up the demand with a
string of vile oaths.

Before Alan could summon his scattered wits, Lynde glided in with a
white, appealing face. Wordlessly she grasped Alan's arm, drew him
out, and shut the door.

"Oh, I've been watching for you," she said breathlessly. "I was afraid
you might come tonight--but I missed you."

"But your father?" said Alan in amazement. "How have I angered him?"

"Hush. Come into the garden. I will explain there."

He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white
roses were now in full blow.

"Father isn't angry with you," said Lynde in a low shamed voice. "It's
just--he takes strange moods sometimes. Then he seems to hate us
all--even me--and he is like that for days. He seems to suspect and
dread everybody as if they were plotting against him. You--perhaps you
think he has been drinking? No, that is not the trouble. These
terrible moods come on without any cause that we know of. Even Mother
could not do anything with him when he was like that. You must go away
now--and do not come back until his dark mood has passed. He will be
just as glad to see you as ever then, and this will not make any
difference with him. Don't come back for a week at least."

"I do not like to leave you in such trouble, Miss Oliver."

"Oh, it doesn't matter about me--I have Emily. And there is nothing
you could do. Please go at once. Father knows I am talking to you and
that will vex him still more."

Alan, realizing that he could not help her and that his presence only
made matters worse, went away perplexedly. The following week was a
miserable one for him. His duties were distasteful to him and meeting
his people a positive torture. Sometimes Mrs. Danby looked dubiously
at him and seemed on the point of saying something--but never said it.
Isabel King watched him when they met, with bold probing eyes. In his
abstraction he did not notice this any more than he noticed a certain
subtle change which had come over the members of his congregation--as
if a breath of suspicion had blown across them and troubled their
confidence and trust. Once Alan would have been keenly and instantly
conscious of this slight chill; now he was not even aware of it.

When he ventured to go back to Four Winds he found the Captain on the
point of starting off for a cruise in his yacht. He was urbane and
friendly, utterly ignoring the incident of Alan's last visit and
regretting that business compelled him to go down the lake. Alan saw
him off with small regret and turned joyfully to Lynde, who was
walking under the pines with her dogs. She looked pale and tired and
her eyes were still troubled, but she smiled proudly and made no
reference to what had happened.

"I'm going to put these flowers on Mother's grave," she said, lifting
her slender hands filled with late white roses. "Mother loved flowers
and I always keep them near her when I can. You may come with me if
you like."

Alan had known Lynde's mother was buried under the pines but he had
never visited the spot before. The grave was at the westernmost end of
the pine wood, where it gave out on the lake, a beautiful spot, given
over to silence and shadow.

"Mother wished to be buried here," Lynde said, kneeling to arrange her
flowers. "Father would have taken her anywhere but she said she wanted
to be near us and near the lake she had loved so well. Father buried
her himself. He wouldn't have anyone else do anything for her. I am so
glad she is here. It would have been terrible to have seen her taken
far away--my sweet little mother."

"A mother is the best thing in the world--I realized that when I lost
mine," said Alan gently. "How long is it since your mother died?"

"Three years. Oh, I thought I should die too when she did. She was
very ill--she was never strong, you know--but I never thought she
could die. There was a year then--part of the time I didn't believe in
God at all and the rest I hated Him. I was very wicked but I was so
unhappy. Father had so many dreadful moods and--there was something
else. I used to wish to die."

She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground. Alan,
leaning against a pine tree, looked down at her. The sunlight fell
through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted
up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood
brown. All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time
and she seemed like a helpless, weary child. He wanted to take her in
his arms and comfort her.

"You must resemble your mother," he said absently, as if thinking
aloud. "You don't look at all like your father."

Lynde shook her head.

"No, I don't look like Mother either. She was tiny and dark--she had a
sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair. Oh,
I remember her look so well. I wish I did resemble her. I loved her
so--I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble. At
least, she died in peace."

There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl's voice
as she spoke the last sentence. Again Alan felt the unpleasant
impression that there was much in her that he did not understand--might
never understand--although such understanding was necessary to perfect
friendship. She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him
before, yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in
jealous repression. It must be something connected with her father,
Alan thought. Doubtless, Captain Anthony's past would not bear
inspection, and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her
knowledge. His heart filled with aching pity for her; he raged secretly
because he was so powerless to help her. Her girlhood had been
blighted, robbed of its meed of happiness and joy. Was she likewise to
miss her womanhood? Alan's hands clenched involuntarily at the
unuttered question.

On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King. She turned and
walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its
inhabitants. If Alan had troubled himself to look, he would have seen
a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes. But the only eyes which
had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver.

       *       *       *       *       *

During Alan's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde,
either in the house or out of it. This surprised and worried him.
There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony, who continued to
be suave and friendly. Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the
Captain, who was witty, incisive, and pungent; yet he disliked the man
himself more at every visit. If he had been compelled to define his
impression, he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel.

But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something.
Sometimes he caught her glance, full of perplexity and--it almost
seemed--distrust. She looked as if she felt hostile towards him. But
Alan dismissed the idea as absurd. She had been friendly from the
first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval. Lynde's
mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem. She had not gone
away, for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her, he responded
indifferently that she was out walking. Alan caught a glint of
amusement in the older man's eyes as he spoke. He could have sworn it
was malicious amusement.

One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore. As he turned the
headland of the cove, he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet
away. The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared
among the firs.

Alan was thunderstruck. There was no room for doubt that she meant to
avoid him. He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings
which he did not even then understand. He only realized that he felt
bitterly hurt and grieved--puzzled as well. What did it all mean?

He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and
stopped her resolutely.

"Miss Oliver," he said bluntly, "is Miss Lynde angry with me? And
why?"

Emily looked at him piercingly.

"Have you no idea why?" she asked shortly.

"None in the world."

She looked at him through and through a moment longer. Then, seeming
satisfied with her scrutiny, she picked up her pail.

"Come down to the spring with me," she said.

As soon as they were out of sight of the house, Emily began abruptly.

"If you don't know why Lynde is acting so, I can't tell you, for I
don't know either. I don't even know if she is angry. I only thought
perhaps she was--that you had done or said something to vex
her--plaguing her to go to church maybe. But if you didn't, it may not
be anger at all. I don't understand that girl. She's been different
ever since her mother died. She used to tell me everything before
that. You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong. But
maybe I can tell you something. Did you write her a letter a
fortnight ago?"

"A letter? No."

"Well, she got one then. I thought it came from you--I didn't know who
else would be writing to her. A boy brought it and gave it to her at
the door. She's been acting strange ever since. She cries at
night--something Lynde never did before except when her mother died.
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed. You
must find out what was in that letter, Mr. Douglas."

"Have you any idea who the boy was?" Alan asked, feeling somewhat
relieved. The mystery was clearing up, he thought. No doubt it was the
old story of some cowardly anonymous letter. His thoughts flew
involuntarily to Isabel King.

Emily shook her head.

"No. He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a
little."

"Oh, that is the postmaster's son," said Alan disappointedly. "That
puts us further off the scent than ever. The letter was probably
dropped in the box at the office and there will consequently be no way
of tracing the writer."

"Well, I can't tell you anything more," said Emily. "You'll have to
ask Lynde for the truth."

This Alan was determined to do whenever he should meet her. He did not
go to the house with Emily but wandered about the shore, watching for
Lynde and not seeing her. At length he went home, a prey to stormy
emotions. He realized at last that he loved Lynde Oliver. He wondered
how he could have been so long blind to it. He knew that he must have
loved her ever since he had first seen her. The discovery amazed but
did not shock him. There was no reason why he should not love
her--should not woo and win her for his wife if she cared for him. She
was good and sweet and true. Anything of doubt in her antecedents
could not touch her. Probably the world would look upon Captain
Anthony as a somewhat undesirable father-in-law for a minister, but
that aspect of the question did not disturb Alan. As for the trouble
of the letter, he felt sure he would easily be able to clear it away.
Probably some malicious busybody had become aware of his frequent
calls at Four Winds and chose to interfere in his private affairs
thus. For the first time it occurred to him that there had been a
certain lack of cordiality among his people of late. If it were really
so, doubtless this was the reason. At any other time this would have
been of moment to him. But now his thoughts were too wholly taken up
with Lynde and the estrangement on her part to attach much importance
to anything else. What she thought mattered incalculably more to Alan
than what all the people in Rexton put together thought. He had the
right, like any other man, to woo the woman of his choice and he would
certainly brook no outside interference in the matter.

After a sleepless night he went back to Four Winds in the morning.
Lynde would not expect him at that time and he would have more chance
of finding her. The result justified his idea, for he met her by the
spring.

Alan felt shocked at the change in her appearance. She looked as if
years of suffering had passed over her. Her lips were pallid, and
hollow circles under her eyes made them appear unnaturally large. He
had last left the girl in the bloom of her youth; he found her again a
woman on whom life had laid its heavy hand.

A burning flood of colour swept over her face as they met, then
receded as quickly, leaving her whiter than before. Without any waste
of words, Alan plunged abruptly into the subject.

"Miss Oliver, why have you avoided me so of late? Have I done anything
to offend you?"

"No." She spoke as if the word hurt her, her eyes persistently cast
down.

"Then what is the trouble?"

There was no answer. She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if
seeking some way of escape. There was none, for the spring was set
about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path.

He leaned forward and took her hands in his.

"Miss Oliver, you must tell me what the trouble is," he said firmly.

She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face, her form
shaken by stormy sobs. In distress he put his arm about her and drew
her closer.

"Tell me, Lynde," he whispered tenderly.

She broke away from him, saying passionately, "You must not come to
Four Winds any more. You must not have anything more to do with
us--any of us. We have done you enough harm already. But I never
thought it could hurt you--oh, I am sorry, sorry!"

"Miss Oliver, I want to see that letter you received the other
evening. Oh"--as she started with surprise--"I know about it--Emily
told me. Who wrote it?"

"There was no name signed to it," she faltered.

"Just as I thought. Well, you must let me see it."

"I cannot--I burned it."

"Then tell me what was in it. You must. This matter must be cleared
up--I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the
malice of some coward. What did that letter say?"

"It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your
frequent visits here--that it had made a great scandal--that it was
doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having
to leave Rexton."

"That would be a catastrophe indeed," said Alan drily. "Well, what
else?"

"Nothing more--at least, nothing about you. The rest was about
myself--I did not mind it--much. But I was so sorry to think that I
had done you harm. It is not too late to undo it. You must not come
here any more. Then they will forget."

"Perhaps--but I should not forget. It's a little too late for me.
Lynde, you must not let this venomous letter come between us. I love
you, dear--I've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my
wife."

Alan had not intended to say that just then, but the words came to his
lips in spite of himself. She looked so sad and appealing and weary
that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her.

She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or
shrinking in them. Instead, they were full of a blank, incredulous
horror that swallowed up every other feeling. There was no mistaking
their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan's heart. He had
certainly not expected a too ready response on her part--he knew that
even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her
avowal of it--but he certainly had not expected to see such evident
abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed. She put up her hand as if
warding a blow.

"Don't--don't," she gasped. "You must not say that--you must never say
it. Oh, I never dreamed of this. If I had thought it possible you
could--love me, I would never have been friends with you. Oh, I've
made a terrible mistake."

She wrung her hands piteously together, looking like a soul in
torment. Alan could not bear to see her pain.

"Don't feel such distress," he implored. "I suppose I've spoken too
abruptly--but I'll be so patient, dear, if you'll only try to care for
me a little. Can't you, dear?"

"I can't marry you," said Lynde desperately. She leaned against a slim
white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly.
"Won't you please go away and forget me?"

Púseme happy with him; rogóme that will help a bit there and left
the room: llegóse mine, put his head inside it, did the same in the
middle of the hall bedroom, and trance then the door of it. When
he returned to his starting point, from where I was watching full
of surprise, also closed the door locked, and I said pleasant and
smiling, but tired of drowning: - Are you amazed a little snooping
of these lebrel, eh?

Respondíle yes, adding: - Well, all are necessary, so people are curious,
when the case requires it now.

Meanwhile, repairs or what I go jaciendo, and be charitable when you
ask for help. That said, he went to the cupboard which was near the
window and on the same wall, and opened with a keys on a key chain
that took out, pushing much of an inside pocket of his waistcoat.

The cupboard was little substance, and no more than one shelf at
half height.

And on the shelf below it had a dozen bundles, arranciados most of
them and tied with twine and frayed half destorcido. - They are
copies of deeds - I told my uncle - old accounts partition property,
waste paper and other family ...

Putting it all go above that comfortable because I have not already
winded or alone to raise his arms ... My life of hell ... of pispajo!
... I did what I ordered, and was taken out of the cupboard, in
addition to the bundles, three pairs of silver candlesticks, a
tray and covered several of the same metal, and a pile of crap,
including more than six pounds of dust salvadera wrapped in a paper
estraza and a half carafe of white azumbre with a paluco inside.

The inside of the jar and paluco were covered with a very dark crust
removed and fourth. Asked my uncle with a look what it that and
he replied: - This is for ink ... I was, because the latter made the
past year, has to spare. The did it with guts and Caparra, and stir
into the pitcher that paluco, which is higar, because no other
wood is: Take the wrong color ink. After emptying the cupboard, my
uncle sent me that pulled the shelf pulling me. Remove the shelf, which
was heavy and brown, as the whole interior of the cupboard. Remained
on the bottom of it, vertically and one in each corner, two wide
strips, which appeared to be there to hold the ends of the two horizontal
and closer, which rested on the shelf, but his was another very different
destination were single and used to hide some pins of iron that
attaches to the side panels of the merits. This brought to an end,
after you remove the hindrance of the four strips, and overcome the
difficulty, not small, rusty pins running, a lump appeared in the
black bowels of the wall. - Jala that cá pa-dragging - my uncle said
to me pointing out the package with your hand over my shoulder
half embedded in the cupboard. Embutílos still more to do what I ordered
my uncle, arrived with his hands on the package, which had four faces,
hard and cold as they were of iron, bent fingers on the edges of the
bottom, and pull me - but I am not satisfied on the first pull,
because the box was very heavy, and I need to repeat with greater
force to drag it to the mouth of the cupboard, where I left it on
behalf of my uncle. - Now - I ordered - then give half back, so as to
face us back. Hícelo well, and she appeared in the lock, which to the
naked eye was nothing of particular. The box would measure just over
a foot wide, by foot and half of something high. - Current - said my
uncle then -. Now let me get where you are, but repaired well see what
I do best to find what you going to explain.

So chose one of the keys to your key ring, and with hands trembling
slightly, was directed to a certain point of lock box. All of these
procedures and details iban putting my curiosity and my surprise at
an extraordinary level of tension.

The look of the room, so austere that bordered on the poor, its
doors and immediately locked, exhausted man, wrapped in a rough
and disheveled clothing, which included the face livid, eyes sunk
and shining, hands and dead bodies, that of black cupboard and fund
it, even over black, a box hidden in an iron trap more or less
ingenious, a light illuminating the gloomy stay, and outside the
bellows of the hurricane I was looking at a whole passage of
melodrama, in which I played a gallant role of young, sheltered
desalmado usurer, for one of those incomprehensible whims of the
human heart. - This box - my uncle told me when I revealed the
secret of his virtually lock, easy to learn, after explanation -
the one went and Jizo jerreru here very much and amañante idea, and
gave my father and for it was opened, walking time, the pantry in
this morio, not four feet lower massif.

There is no record of attempted robbery in the house, but since
there was a box with something to keep secret in it ...

As soon as it opened, and given a good part of what saved my uncle
turned to me and she said, as if reading the thoughts in my head
bullies - the least you figured you to see what is happening here while
ago, that your uncle is a avariento forsaken of God; dealing with
deslumbrarte eyes the fruits of their prey. The truth, Marcelo: I figure
it, since in your case. I smiled without saying a word, and my uncle
continued: - But as with everything, this time the signals fail.
This that you see here is, in sum settlement and to save your Uncle
Celso ... and the pot of poor Tablanca.

These are the loose jewelry that have arrived to my hands, as were
similar to those of your father, inheritance of older, less a
few, they start gold necklaces and these reefs, and this silver
locket fine stone, which I gave to my poor wife when we married
and had legármelos commitment to his death. These cartridges short or
long, thick and thin, gold coins are all of them.

I do not know what to set up, because I never wanted to sweat to
find out.

What I do know is that it declines depends on the needs they have outside
of my house. To me and those that live in it, with us about what
gives us the land each year, and we treat it well and what you want
your mouth. The sources that have been flowing, they are not, as you
can understand the poor and the tierrucas won Tablanca: others
are far from here, and old in the family, better springs.'ll Have news
of all, when need them in roles that are in these files and up
above the comfortable ... velos there a while ago because I walked
with them in hand.

What is important to know without delay so that it can thunder, is that
had this joriaco what you have in view and is not in stock anywhere,
and that this, jewelry and coins is one of your membership from
this very moment.

Surprised with the occurrence, I tried to do very formal objections
to my uncle.

I consented to say a single word. - It is my business - told me, tapándome
mouth with one hand, cold as stone burial - and he resolved on
giving me the win.

I am also into vena talking, and I just need to speak and no one cutting
me the word ... ¡Trastajo! Up to get the backlog of these days
Murria black. The worst is for life! Pispajo! I am missing is the
breath ... Let rest a little. Sat on a chair breathing hard, lívido
more expensive than before, and transudate. Encourage re not
talking about that case or any other, because he needed rest and
quiet, but I took no account of the council. A little while, but
without moving from your chair, and continued: - It warns you,
you have to understand, not try to match this to the great misery
that gives me little to do.

The proof of this, if you do not just my word, I will find, made at the
gates of death, when the first attack of this disease ... bitch I
repeat that I let me just talk until you finish everything I want
to tell you. Another day you speak, and leg ... Returning to the case,
I say that all this is yours now, have left many of these people believe
that miracles mine, because many times do I have to pray a little
with the excuse of not being able, because of soft letting them
discover the early spring from it and Poor Poor Me, son of the soul!

because, at settlement, these men, though good in the main, they
are rude and which are governed more by mouth than by understanding
...

Nor do I say this from the source to be bound thereby anything, but
because it is the truth and not know where ... as I know everyone
has their own way to kill fleas, and you'll have your own particular,
therefore, will make your layer a coat or two, or that you crave ...
or none, if you feel better. But (the example and go to see the case
on both sides) if you searched here for some days to follow the
same tastes that I have had with respect to this neighborhood, do
not hide that I have to cost a lot of work to beginning, and after
some trouble.

To help selvedging the initial difficulties, I recommend the
Cure, who knows as well as I do, and even much better than me, how
lame walk each of his parishioners. Also you can help, and good,
Celis Neluco, the doctor, that guy though, will have a pearl for these
things, great eye and understanding. I warn you that the cure is
the only man outside the two of us, who knows what is stored on this
wall. I thought I should declare if you did not, because they
do not ever eat mice, or were to stop in time, hands that do not
deserve it, because I have no forced heirs or other relatives that
these two poor bandits me talked the other day, and are not deserving,
rather than a shackle that will not fail, if they live ...

Let me pass this blow me cough and take another breath. Oh, trastajo,
what are we perhaps miseriuca! This time it was the longest
break from my uncle, because he was the greatest fatigue cough.

As they answered a bit, he continued: - Well, and what you would:
you're aware of things and you have your plan in motion: begin here
the joys of the good involved, but the big disappointment, weapons
if you do not much patience, but far pispajo!

Because again I say that these men, as you fall so quickly, they
are not all saints.

But we have five fingers on each hand and no two are equal: the
same is true among the children of family and going into a family
and a few blood alone, what does not happen in a family of many,
as is that there are so many sons of different mothers?

Toparás, occasionally, even ungrateful, and you will see that this
is the stumbling block over the most painful and forced to close
their eyes to go ahead with the duty that one has with God and their
good intentions, and work well , to look to these unfortunate
children who most need their weakness, love and monitoring of the
father.

In any luck, prosperity and thank you for the good consoles the
ingratitude of those who are not so much because evil itself, I do
not know here: truth be told.

Taken in this way the task, eventually taking a lot of law, but Beware
of giving either never secured by the firm believe that everywhere,
and because higher towers of the same make have been the ground
of the night to morning.

So sure I like these men, had to Coteruco of my great friend
of Don Román Llosía, and already I have counted how and why, two
years ago, came as the new policies that govern us today, in an
open and closed eyes were the hands, and grateful, and loving men,
became fierce enemies his own, to the point of having the gentleman,
more pain that what he saw for fear that I had to move Santander
to his residence with his family.

And there are going to date, without taking the eyes of his people,
albeit with the consolation, of late, seeing how there are fewer and
Joanna sighed for him that he vilified them as stools go back
to the bottom of the cuba, revolt by vile hands.

What you try on the other hand, my son, that the good seed can not
ever bad fruit, and in the short or long, and well after seeding,
the good always triumphs afloat and out above all.

I do not tire you more for now, and we will leave, if you paez, as
were all junk.

To do so is, I came because my poor uncle was not to move the chair,
and barely managed to drawn from the key ring from the chest after
I closed and opened several times under his direction, not to forget
me the secret of the lock, and while I was putting everything in
its place the cupboard and trance, which Key also wanted to separate
the key ring, and I finally separated, their players, or forces him
to have no patience for this.

He gave me two keys, without the slightest word against his decision
irrevocable. - But soul of God - I said finally thinking - do not
you know that you are useless in my keychain?

Have you seen it or move tablucas desclavadas I have left the
cupboard forces and How, without giving quarter to the crier, I
have to compose to get their hands on what is inside the box?

Do not you think? For if (as is expected) I needed something so I have
left in life, not to achieve the ordinary walking over to the
hand in the drawers of that comfort, ask yourself the point was settled.
So enough of this conversation, and another thing ... I also bring
you to your room these roles he was browsing when I entered here,
to get you aware of them if you do not have anything more fun in
what entertained.

He hurried awkwardly and with all those who were scattered on the
chest of drawers, a pitiful mess, and I handed them well.

As I folded and ordered a little better, he apologized and explained
that objections were futile: I did not want to hear me.

When I finished my brief and easy task, he said: - Now turn, my
son, your chores a little orear and head for the house and go with
the confidence that if the treaty between the two here I've removed
off the disease, you have given me strength and spirit that no
longer had to carry it without fear or penalty to the burial, and
this, in my view, is worth more than good health. then hugged me,
and I still said before I move toward the exit, turning him into
the sunshine: - Look, man, until God's anger seems to have calmed
down too: and therefore it does not rain nor thunder nor rebomba
the wind as before.

And it was the truth: the light of the stay, go away despite the
afternoon, it was less sad than when I entered it.

XIX Closing the evening of that day were only rumors about the storm
distant and intermittent, like panting of his tiredness after a
fierce and continuous fighting and a half weeks.

On this occasion was the gathering something more lively than the
previous last patriarch and chairman until it seemed another chatterbox
who was so espabilado and humor. Well I knew the cause of the miracle.
As Facia knew that, unlike all others, so downcast and gloomy walk
the few times you see left in the kitchen.

Missing those prints to the poor of the storm at the mouth of the
chimney, which showed the soot collected thousands of scabs as big
as the palm of the hand that redouble the hail on the doors and
windows of the mansion ; that incessant trickle of goteriales the
roof, and that flow of rain by patios and courtyards, sparkling racing
despeñaban which then declines to seek out the river no longer fit in
its bed. Mirabal I sometimes compassionate, and she respondíame with
a melancholy look, which seemed to mean: "It is good there, Do you
see how miserable I am?"

And this was what worried me most that night, when both self and
had to use imagination after what happened two hours earlier in the
room of my uncle.

       Are not you the naughty things unexplained human condition?

But then tables are turned and I paid all together, as is often said,
because it just hit in the eye all night, and that I had gotten into
bed quite neglected to have seen my uncle in his sleep with the peace
a boy. Then I saw it with the most insignificant details, and with all
its light and its attendant assumptions, inferences and comments
from the scene that afternoon! I could not see if in the end,
thinking so much and she was both pleased and mortified me: there
were nuances to everything in the box and thoughts.

The truth was that anxiety and nervous with the battle of my concerns
in the dark, turned on the light, and though I had not turned on,
I remembered my uncle's papers that I had to say in his room, and I
had saved then in a convenient drawer. - good action - I thought - to
endure those long hours of sleeplessness. Levantéme away, I took the
papers and I went to bed, ready to hear them. The main three
were: the testament of my uncle, an inventory of properties for sale
and rental value, and a dedicated memory for me, yours lyrics, with
lines very cluttered and very twisted: it was signed after the date
of testament, and very little prior to the first letter I wrote after
getting sick. I started to the testament, which was long and thorough.
After sending the pious and charitable, who were many, including one
very important on the local primary school, was very good legacies to
his servants, particularly Facia, which left the property, apart from
its legacy cash The house, with land and livestock, in which he
had recently married to the knave who deceived her, forgave all
debts to their convecinos of Tablanca and the income year in which
death llevadores to their farms, flocks and herds .

My sister left an estate of two he had in the province of Leon, and
the remaining flow after them and made other minor deductions, I called
my heir, being the only male in the direct line of Ruiz de Bejos.
Put things here, and much to my surprise after the treaty in the evening
hand in hand with the testator, joined vivid desire to know
the approximate value of the estate. After all, what a devil!, I
was too skinny for meat like other men. As I expected, which was
acquired by a history of my father, the entire flow of my uncle, a
man of his way to live, was very considerable, but for Ruiz Bejos
of my habits and customs, it was something very different: rather,
that flow, as he enjoyed Tablanca enjoyed my uncle was a real wealth,
living as I lived in Madrid without manirroto be much less, I would
have eaten in a few years.

Yet (what do not deny what dislike because it is inherent in the human
frame?), I was very pleased with the estate, which would become
the first landowner in Tablanca. Who would dislike to be the first
anywhere in the world habitable and inhabited by dark, it is minimal?
It compensated for this weakness, the mortification she felt the
concerns that were not so selfless as I thought with loving gratitude
to my heart responded to the largess of my uncle and distinctions.

His memory, along with the spontaneous and enjoyable disheveled that
he himself was reduced to expose myself, broadly speaking, the shell
of his charity, called him "his duty", the main fruits of it, what it
will cost you money every year, because patience is not calo had no
degree, and a list of families Tablanca more worthy, for their
particular conditions and capabilities, and the under estimation
of the "mansion".

Everything I just said to my government. The only task that I did,
and very expensive, was to ensure that no break in my life the heritage
of the Ruiz de Bejos happened to my hands full and as he had received
from his father and him those of his, nor my children to inherit,
if they have them, and if not, what will happen to my sister with
the same recommendation for the same purposes, provided they were
compatible with the laws.

For suddenly, and for "what behind closed doors" to let me guide the
directions of the priest Don Sabas Peña, and if he did not live
longer, the person I look for his mandate.

He could not be explained more clearly there, because the roles are
things that light takes the air easily, "and you will know in whose
hands will give the best."

Then I name the person responsible for administering the estates' that
lay 'outside the valley and the province, warning and concluded
that, as stated in the will, when he wrote those lines that owed
nothing to anyone, as not his soul to God, whose mercy and whom he
hoped to make calling a miracle that I ever felt the desire to leave
the bones in the cemetery of Tablanca, having lived many years in
the house of the Ruiz de Bejos.

Like the other roles, though related to the flow of my uncle gave
me no great interest, I quit reading his arrest at the time, and
devoted the time he had well over a space of imagination, the eyes
closed, by varied field of the events of that day.

So I took the dream very close to the dawn. When I woke up, came
the light in my office by the quarter that always left the door ajar
in the sunshine.

I thought the light was more cheerful than I had been greeted in
identical cases over the last two weeks, or that the sun was already
high up, which would not be so strange that I had stayed late at
night.

Watch reló I had the head of the bed and saw that they were little
more than eight.

Despite the lack of which made me sleep a while more, and opened
levantéme entire quarter. The sky was low since there was a blue
satin and silk cloth, and sun bathing and all the peaks of the West.
Relucían rocks and logs and Bardales and soil all around, yes, and
she felt a cold wet and sticky until it reached the bone, but was
smiling and calm nature, and it lifted their spirits much.

Pensando rather than the things on my uncle, who wanted to salute like
to get up every day (especially since he was so downcast, and I had
recommended the doctor much greater vigilance on him), and discussing
with the memories that this feeling is iban awakening in my memory,
I dispatched my air operations in the toilet.
It would injure you. There is Father. I
love him and he has always been very kind to me. But--but--there's
something wrong--you know it--some crime in his past--"

"The only man who knew that is dead."

"We do not know that he was the only man. I am the daughter of a
criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas. No, Alan, don't plead,
please. I won't think differently--I never can."

There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan's
heart. He prepared to entreat and argue, but before he could utter a
word, the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down
from the bank.

"I've been listening," he announced coolly, "and I think it high time
I took a share in the conversation. You seem to have run up against a
snag, Mr. Douglas. You say Frank Harmon is dead. That's good riddance
if it's true. Is it true?"

"His brother declares it is."

"Well, then, I'll help you all I can. I like you, Mr. Douglas, and I
happen to be fond of Lynde, too--though you mayn't believe it. I'm
fond of her for her mother's sake and I'd like to see her happy. I
didn't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I
couldn't help myself. He had the upper hand, curse him. It wasn't for
my own sake, though--it was for my wife's. However, that's all over
and done with and I'll do the best I can to atone for it. So you won't
marry your minister because your father was not a good man, Lynde?
Well, I don't suppose he was a very good man--a man who makes his
wife's life a hell, even in a refined way, isn't exactly a saint, to
my way of thinking. But that's the worst that could be said of him and
it doesn't entail any indelible disgrace on his family, I suppose. I
am not your father, Lynde."

"Not my father?" Lynde echoed the words blankly.

"No. Your father was your mother's first husband. She never told you
of him. When I said he made her life a hell, I said the truth, no
more, no less. I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy, Lynde.
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was
possible to win her love. She married James Ashley. He was a
gentleman, so called--and he didn't kick or beat her. Oh no, he just
tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy, that was all.
He died when you were a baby. And a year later I found out your mother
could love me, rough sailor and all as I was. I married her and
brought her here. We had fifteen years of happiness together. I'm not
a good man--but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked
health and her dark memories. It was her wish that you should be known
as my daughter, but under the present circumstances I know she would
wish that you should be told the truth. Marry your man, Lynde, and go
away with him. Emily will go with you if you like. I'm going back to
the sea. I've been hankering for it ever since your mother died. I'll
go out of your life. There, don't cry--I hate to see a woman cry. Mr.
Douglas, I'll leave you to dry her tears and I'll go up to the house
and have a talk with Harmon."

When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point, Alan turned to
Lynde. She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears. Alan
drew her head down on his shoulder.

"Sweetheart, the dark past is all put by. Our future begins with
promise. All is well with us, dear Lynde."

Like a child, she put her arms about his neck and their lips met.


Marcella's Reward


Dr. Clark shook his head gravely. "She is not improving as fast as I
should like to see," he said. "In fact--er--she seems to have gone
backward the past week. You must send her to the country, Miss
Langley. The heat here is too trying for her."

Dr. Clark might as well have said, "You must send her to the moon"--or
so Marcella thought bitterly. Despair filled her heart as she looked
at Patty's white face and transparent hands and listened to the
doctor's coolly professional advice. Patty's illness had already swept
away the scant savings of three years. Marcella had nothing left with
which to do anything more for her.

She did not make any answer to the doctor--she could not. Besides,
what could she say, with Patty's big blue eyes, bigger and bluer than
ever in her thin face, looking at her so wistfully? She dared not say
it was impossible. But Aunt Emma had no such scruples. With a great
clatter and racket, that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty's
almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept
time to her jerky movements.

"Goodness me, doctor, do you think you're talking to millionaires?
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the
country? _I_ can't afford it, that is certain. I think I do pretty
well to give Marcella and Patty their board free, and I have to work
my fingers to the bone to do _that_. It's all nonsense about Patty,
anyhow. What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better. She
doesn't--she just mopes and pines. She won't eat a thing I cook for
her. How can anyone expect to get better if she doesn't eat?"

Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that
she had propounded an unanswerable question. A dull red flush rose to
Marcella's face.

"Oh, Aunt Emma, I _can't_ eat!" said Patty wearily. "It isn't because
I won't--indeed, I can't."

"Humph! I suppose my cooking isn't fancy enough for you--that's the
trouble. Well, I haven't the time to put any frills on it. I think I
do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up
before me. But some people imagine that they were born to be waited
on."

Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room,
slamming the door behind her.

The doctor shrugged his shoulders. He had become used to Miss Gibson's
tirades during Patty's illness. But Marcella had never got used to
them--never, in all the three years she had lived with her aunt. They
flicked on the raw as keenly as ever. This morning it seemed
unbearable. It took every atom of Marcella's self-control to keep her
from voicing her resentful thoughts. It was only for Patty's sake that
she was able to restrain herself. It was only for Patty's sake, too,
that she did not, as soon as the doctor had gone, give way to tears.
Instead, she smiled bravely into the little sister's eyes.

"Let me brush your hair now, dear, and bathe your face."

"Have you time?" said Patty anxiously.

"Yes, I think so."

Patty gave a sigh of content.

"I'm so glad! Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair--she
is in such a hurry. You're so gentle, Marcella, you don't make my head
ache at all. But oh! I'm so tired of being sick. I wish I could get
well faster. Marcy, do you think I can be sent to the country?"

"I--I don't know, dear. I'll see if I can think of any way to manage
it," said Marcella, striving to speak hopefully.

Patty drew a long breath.

"Oh, Marcy, it would be lovely to see the green fields again, and the
woods and brooks, as we did that summer we spent in the country
before Father died. I wish we could live in the country always. I'm
sure I would soon get better if I could go--if it was only for a
little while. It's so hot here--and the factory makes such a noise--my
head seems to go round and round all the time. And Aunt Emma scolds
so."

"You mustn't mind Aunt Emma, dear," said Marcella. "You know she
doesn't really mean it--it is just a habit she has got into. She was
really very good to you when you were so sick. She sat up night after
night with you, and made me go to bed. There now, dearie, you're fresh
and sweet, and I must hurry to the store, or I'll be late. Try and
have a little nap, and I'll bring you home some oranges tonight."

Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty's cheek, put on her hat and went out.
As soon as she left the house, she quickened her steps almost to a
run. She feared she would be late, and that meant a ten-cent fine. Ten
cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella's eyes when every
dime meant so much. But fast as she went, her distracted thoughts went
faster. She could not send Patty to the country. There was no way,
think, plan, worry as she might. And if she could not! Marcella
remembered Patty's face and the doctor's look, and her heart sank like
lead. Patty was growing weaker every day instead of stronger, and the
weather was getting hotter. Oh, if Patty were to--to--but Marcella
could not complete the sentence even in thought.

If they were not so desperately poor! You will be charged, because we
would have to be careful, these young people racing to keep locked
up. But so far went to him our love, we deluded ourselves against
what the intelligence required, and compared hierinn a person with a
bad injury is tainted, and made him fear that he wants to be known, so
long nourished until he the Mark of his life has weggefressen. Where
is he gone? Queen.Three years before, when Marcella had been sixteen and Patty nine,
their parents had died, leaving them absolutely alone in the world
except for their father's half-sister, Miss Gibson, who lived in
Canning and earned her livelihood washing and mending for the hands
employed in the big factory nearby. She had grudgingly offered the
girls a home, which Marcella had accepted because she must. She
obtained a position in one of the Canning stores at three dollars a
week, out of which she contrived to dress herself and Patty and send
the latter to school. Her life for three years was one of absolute
drudgery, yet until now she had never lost courage, but had struggled
bravely on, hoping for better times in the future when she should get
promotion and Patty would be old enough to teach school.

But now Marcella's courage and hopefulness had gone out like a spent
candle. She was late at the store, and that meant a fine; her head
ached, and her feet felt like lead as she climbed the stairs to her
department--a hot, dark, stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter.
It was warm and close at any time, but today it was stifling, and
there was already a crowd of customers, for it was the day of a
bargain sale. The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella's
tortured nerves. She felt that she wanted to scream, but instead she
turned calmly to a waiting customer--a big, handsome, richly dressed
woman. Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the
woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in
the country for a year.

She was Mrs. Liddell--Marcella knew her by sight--and she was in a
very bad temper because she had been kept waiting. For the next half
hour she badgered and worried Marcella to the point of distraction.
Nothing suited her. Pile after pile, box after box, of shirtwaists
did Marcella take down for her, only to have them flung aside with
sarcastic remarks. Mrs. Liddell seemed to hold Marcella responsible
for the lack of waists that suited her; her tongue grew sharper and
sharper and her comments more trying. Then she mislaid her purse, and
was disagreeable about that until it turned up.

Marcella shut her lips so tightly that they turned white to keep back
the impatient retort that rose momentarily to her lips. The insolence
of some customers was always trying to the sensitive, high-spirited
girl, but today it seemed unbearable. Her head throbbed fiercely with
the pain of the ever-increasing ache, and--what was the lady on her
right saying to a friend?

"Yes, she had typhoid, you know--a very bad form. She rallied from it,
but she was so exhausted that she couldn't really recover, and the
doctor said--"

"Really," interrupted Mrs. Liddell's sharp voice, "may I ask you to
attend to me, if you please? No doubt gossip may be very interesting
to you, but I am accustomed to having a clerk pay _some_ small
attention to my requirements. If you cannot attend to your business, I
shall go to the floor walker and ask him to direct me to somebody who
can. The laziness and disobligingness of the girls in this store is
really getting beyond endurance."

A passionate answer was on the point of Marcella's tongue. All her
bitterness and suffering and resentment flashed into her face and
eyes. For one moment she was determined to speak out, to repay Mrs.
Liddell's insolence in kind. A retort was ready to her hand. Everyone
knew that Mrs. Liddell, before her marriage to a wealthy man, had been
a working girl. What could be easier than to say contemptuously: "You
should be a judge of a clerk's courtesy and ability, madam. You were a
shop girl yourself once?"

But if she said it, what would follow? Prompt and instant dismissal.
And Patty? The thought of the little sister quelled the storm in
Marcella's soul. For Patty's sake she must control her temper--and she
did. With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back
the hot words and said quietly: "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Liddell. I
did not mean to be inattentive. Let me show you some of our new
lingerie waists, I think you will like them."

But Mrs. Liddell did not like the new lingerie waists which Marcella
brought to her in her trembling hands. For another half hour she
examined and found fault and sneered. Then she swept away with the
scornful remark that she didn't see a thing there that was fit to
wear, and she would go to Markwell Bros. and see if they had anything
worth looking at.

When she had gone, Marcella leaned against the counter, pale and
exhausted. She must have a breathing spell. Oh, how her head ached!
How hot and stifling and horrible everything was! She longed for the
country herself. Oh, if she and Patty could only go away to some place
where there were green clover meadows and cool breezes and great hills
where the air was sweet and pure!

During all this time a middle-aged woman had been sitting on a stool
beside the bargain counter. When a clerk asked her if she wished to be
waited on, she said, "No, I'm just waiting here for a friend who
promised to meet me."

Finally, he stopped and he was satisfied by the white stubble beard
rubbed, as if this is mainly due to the excellent development of
thought would be involved, he gave loud and determined his opinion:
"No, no surgery, but they must be in a Solbad -- yes, yes - quite right
- and now, because it is the highest of all time. "" In a bath?
"repeated Wilms confused, while he is slowly on the forehead
stressed.

And it was again the unfortunate guilt, which failed, and how he
was missing almost everything, just the house keeping to deny.

The drops of sweat appeared on his forehead, only with severe tongue,
he could argue: "But - but the means to do so will probably be very
large?"

"Yes, it's not cheap," Dr. Hull said, and saw the participating tenants
to: "So tomorrow I write to you while your wife has to go." Thus it is
adopted, took his stick, shook his hand and Wilms just wanted the
girl paternally gallantly kissing the tips of her fingers, as he properly
horrified by it substantially, and with a loud call from his breast
pocket a multiple sealed letter demographic aging. "That I had almost
forgotten," he punished himself, "child, here - your father has
to remove it to me. - There is money inside, and he told me that
you already expect.

Oh, yes that would be a nice story. What? Well, adieu, Kindting.
"This progressive and Dr. Hull breitbeinig venerable addition
to the door and drove straight to Försterin whose skin still on
the evening every scratch insignia showed the Physici stubble of
beard and his cure every left. - - - In the unpleasant "good office"
of the lease house remained two people alone.

Both looked to the country and shy man with palpitations, the girl
and nearly urging as they expect, the brother wants to ask why they
have the money after the leave. Typically they pressed the letter against
her chest and had her brown eyes encouraging to his hanging, but
was silent Wilms and bit lips firmly together.

One should now follow humiliation - "not just money of it - just
not, "he went through the mind, and he raffte and wanted to go.

Since sounded from the sick room a weak voice röchelnde between." Wilms
- Hedwig - comes to me. "Both frightened. It sounded so distant,
so ghostly. Now it had happened. Marriage is Wilms versah, Hedwig
stood close to the husbandman, and aware, and as there would be no
opposition, they pushed him with a fixed view the letter in his
hand.

He pushed him back, as if the paper between his fingers biting
fire would, but fierce, angry that the girl was Dargebotene again
by itself.

"Come to me," complained it again from inside, "why is it taking so
long? "" Hedwig - what should I do? "stammered Wilms, to the letter
the way."

Quick! - There are 5000 marks - one third of my inheritance -
Wilms, so you need to help you and then pay ELSES travel, you hear?

"I can not - I can not, Hedwig."

"Why not?" "Because - because - -" he did not answer and kept only
as of disgust covered much of the money itself.

"Will you just not be obliged to me?" "Yes," he moaned. "And from what
why?

"" Because - - "The farmers flickered before his eyes, the throat
as he was zugeschnürt.

O, he clearly felt that he should not take money, because this

foreign woman in his thinking had pushed, sinful and abscheuerregend
Unrecognized and yet something in him awake which is painful and
refreshing at the same time he emporhob.

"And if I really understand you ask?"

Hedwig urged simply trust him and laid a hand on his shoulder.
Both looked at each other in a second. there it was again. Since it
broke out again from him. Wilms shook the whole body, a thousand
conflicting voices screamed at him in confusion. "Beat them down,"
irritating to the one. "Hast thou not long enough a woman does?"
Whispered the other, "Embrace it, küss' it." " Great God, what are
you doing out of me, Hedwig? "he tonlos show." I can not! "" And
do you want Elsenhans not help? "she asked again. Never had it so
softly spoken to him. From the hospital room penetrated a matt, first
bender sound. Since Wilms suddenly pressed with his brutal giant of
their two hands in his, still enclosed in the letter, and approached
his head to hers, as if the girl he wanted something zuraunen. But
no word came over his lips, he saw only, and only after some
time it came out piecemeal, "I take 'is yes - if you want it - because
you're good - you're so good." It was like a secret agreement has
come about both. And now she smiled at him fresh and frankly, when
they asked him, after his business to see, because they themselves would
Else everything about the upcoming trip was decided, carefully and
calmly made. He nodded and turned slowly. But even at the door, he
stretched her überwallendem feeling for the second hand. Hedwig stood
still and smiled. "Go only." "Yes, yes," Wilms murmured as if in a
dream, and with a long view: "Thou art good. "X. In the afternoon the
two sisters were alone. Wilms was driven into the city to the Lord
rose to repay money advanced. It was the eighth straight day. And so
were the two women dependent on itself.

Motionless was sick in her bed, in the Bible, on whose cover she softly
back and forth herkratzte, apathy, staring out to the yard, which is
already shrouded in twilight. Hedwig had been awake and busy in
an elegant silk embroidery work but now she is also at the window down
and his head supported on the hand, they are now dreaming,
softly humming a tune, in the declining long time. Dark red sun went
behind the barn to Upgrade. A moment was the entire room plunged
into magical splendor, even the face of the sick in a wonderful splendor
beamed. "How beautiful you are, Hedwig," murmured the floor when
her sister took the sight in their golden-brown hair, the purple
lights, played as in the Transfiguration.

And then she whimpered: "God - that I was once, and now wretched, lame,
always dependent on foreign people."

"Jesus Christ," she suddenly screamed in ecstatic glow and lifted
the emaciated hands in the luminous height, that as they appeared
stained with blood. »Take me to you, but make an end with a destitute
cripple me - I's earnings are no longer so when I see others, so
beautiful, so young, and I - - oh, in the bath water so it's not even
better will be. "Hedwig is not touched. The patient stared anxiously
after her, and she seemed to want to ask something, but her chest
lifted somewhat volatile than usual, since the old slipped Krischan,
the toothless, deaf old man into the room, put with his trembling hand
a sheet of newspaper on the table, and away wordlessly, as he had
appeared. Since Hedwig Pachthof stayed on, she was out of town a
newspaper nachgesandt; eilfertig rose and the girl, therefore, in
order to ignite the lamp and a look at the sheet to be able to throw.

"Hedwig," cried the sick with a trembling voice in between, as the
girl is already a few quiet minutes in the glow of the lamp, the
current events have pursued.

It was the reader, however, escaped as her sister does not look she
had used, although they are excited threw back and forth. "Will you now
take your medicine?"

Asked willingly called by the newspaper laid down.

"No, my child, not yet - I want - but sit down here to me in bed,
- - If I now but in the bathroom, then we will no longer sit so long.

"Silently Hedwig followed the wishes the sister and sat down on a
Korblehnstuhl, to the heads of the bed stood. The sick crouching with
her head completely in the proximity of the sister finally took Hedwigs
hand and laid it on the chest. Clearly the girl felt like panting
and Respiratory went quickly. For a time they remained so, but when
after a while the younger anew after the medicine bottle handy,
Else nervously shook his head and asked, hastily, as if it is
already long in the soul would have been: "Hedwig, I wanted to ask
you, because you like us?

"It was so afraid something in the tone of the poor woman that Hedwig
was restless." Certainly, "she returned quickly," moreover, I came but
only to you to maintain - "The patient was directed to
laboriously:" And what do you think - of Wilms?

"she continued hastily, without just heard raised. terrified Hedwig.
They themselves knew not why. Involuntarily she had just now remember
how ironclad Wilms noted this morning had their hands clasped. The
strong girl was suddenly being alone with the agitated patient and
incredibly oppressive. "Do you suffer from it?" The latter investigated
urgently and umschlang in its seated position, with the neck of his
sister. "Oh yes" - this muttered confused - » Your husband makes a
good, honest impression. And above all, he seems to get so sincerely
worried. "" Do you believe? "Sighed the sick relief. - Then they pushed
the sister to attracting so that her cheek rested on the Hedwigs.
Shuddering felt the touch of the younger fiebergeschüttelten moist
skin, is an unwillingness quieter beschlich her when she is now sick
from the hot and tenderly kissed on the cheek has been. "Yes,
Gottlob," whispered the poor is close to the ear of his sister. "He
loves me still. - But - but - O God, Hedwig, I will confide something
to you.

Look, if I see you, so beautiful and healthy, just like I do now might
be even if I am happy our youth presenting it is to me sometimes as if

it is to me sometimes as if I hated my husband, - you hear? - All

And - oh, yes you can not understand - and I long so for him, but I

and tore the shining eyes wide. "No - no - no - oh, you are my God,

she lifted according to pray; confused confused, in the words
of the Psalm:" Lord God, my Savior, as I scream day and night
before thee.

heavy and dull in their back cushions, and remained with eyes is
slowly extinguishing.

Durchfröstelt cold, but full resistance to this infuses Hedwig ecstatic

drops of soothing medicine. Then she wiped the sweat from his forehead,
which is the end all suffering with the same rigid, less expressive
trains had happened. Nearly one hours verrann so. No sound stirred
in the great room. Dämmernd confidential, as always, spread the big
lamp light, and Hedwig sat on the bed and looked shyly at the
woman, which her husband as the destroyer of their health and hated
at the same time longed for him in a wild, impure passion. " unclean?

"With a weak smile twitched the armpits and the nurse turned her
thoughts back on itself and that a moment, where first a man had
crossed their life.

both arms and bent over it, always violent - with his honest face,
so rough and angry face could.

O, it was so painful, unfortunate-happy feeling. - - And they said
in their Hinträumen that everything was just the sound of After

"So late already? - Where to stay Wilms only liked?

"And again she was shocked that they expect it. Because - she went
on. Her voice to something?"

Oh, mine is much better, "whispered softly to the sick and exciting
put their wet hands on the back of his sister: "You're so quiet and
gentle, my sweet Heting." Well one hours before had the poor fatigue
located in deep slumber, now she is tired and broken and turned dull

Where he went out? "" After Grimmen. "" So? "murmured the sick
in descending together -» he told you that? "And after some time they
sat indifferent adding: "He probably has a lot of confidence to
you?"

"Yes, I think."

The patient fell from her hand Hedwigs medicine, the girl beat her
pillow rightly so that the sufferer calms and quieter than could extend
so far. Then she stood and looked at her beautiful sister for several
minutes pondering disrupted and in the face. Hedwig shot the blood
in his cheeks. You do not even know why. "You want something?" Researched
it quickly.

"No, no, nothing. Come, my darling, I want to ask you something - I'm
your sister, and you're grown up now - Look, there möcht 'I like to
know my Heting, - you can but I do not resent - whether you - what
you over there so experienced in the boarding house have?

"It sounded a little anxious, but more intrusive and curious. Instead
of a reply Hedwig leaned deep into her chair back and closed his eyes.
- It was her, lower than the low ceiling of the room they always deeper
down, as it is lacking in air, as if everything is too narrow and
desolate in this world forsaken Pachthofe. - What did the only sister
with this silly question? - How much Spießbürgerlichkeit was in
it. What she went to all this?

"Ah, now I understand you," she said at last with her clear voice.
"You think of what Count Brach joke told yesterday." They moved the
arms behind the head and the chair rocked quietly back and forth.
"Yes, yes," agreed with Else, "this is not me in the head . And that
is precisely the two women were there. It sounded all so dark, Hedwig,
tell me, my darling, what did you with the Count? "" What I had with
him? "" Yes - you must understand me right - - oh, it stimulates me
so on and chases after me so much fear, complies - - you're still
so inexperienced - - this terrible restlessness has me completely
niedergeworfen since yesterday. - We both have no more mother,
Hedwig, and here am I - "" What I had with him?

"On the face of the younger ones slipped a cold, strange smile, which
probably was the ugly expression, which the patient elected had.
Then they extended their full, reclining chairs in the shape and
shook her head as she wanted to make the call once and for all performers.
"Hedwig, torment me not," cried the sick suddenly with sharp,
irritated voice.

"What did you do with him?" The younger people wanted to get up.
The ordinariness of the expression they just stung, but the
sultriness that this emaciated woman out, the dull seriousness of
which are already strong Wilms worn had also pressed them into her
chair back.

"Will you give me an answer?" "Yes , "said Hedwig." So - I beg you. ""
Quite simply, Else. - The count is, as you know, a Lebemann - "" Oh God
- what? "" You heard yesterday. Therefore, he urged, because many
pretty girls he suspected there in our retirement, and then tried all
sorts of loose Tändeleien's. "" But with thee - Hedwig - with
you? "" With me? "" Yes. "A quick breath was audible. The beautiful,
young body of this beautiful woman walked in as if it were a painful
empfände touch, an almost visible Rain trickles out about them, but
then it crashed and how quickly rushed through her lips: "He once
tried to force me to kiss - nothing more. "" Nothing?

"first and foremost a long satisfied sigh of saturated curiosity. Then
raffte the sick and painstakingly looked at the slim, form the sister
back with terrible joint prior amazement, envy and admiration glowing
eyes. "Yes," she shot through the morbidly excited sense, while it
almost greedily after this fresh young hinstarrte, "yes she is seductively
beautiful, hingestreckte this thing with the light brown hair
goldfunkelnden."

And, with fierce passion awakening overflew the blooming face color of
his sister, raptured at the veiled lights and flashes of eyes and
felt how noble the tight black dress all the enclosed shape. "Heting,
my sweet child," she stammered, and covered the hand of unexpected
surprises with burning kisses. A mistaken, this practical hope dawned
in her: "Love you for the count so much?" Hedwig twitched and was very
pale. Else noticed it.

"Let this," replied the younger finally herb, rose rapidly and progressively
to to the table to get the bulb to unscrew. "No?" cried Else
horrified, "yes but why?" "He's just been naughty."

"Naughty?
He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out,
much to Marilla's disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard
reflection Matthew arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not
dressed like the other girls!

The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced
that Anne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she
had come to Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark
dresses, all made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew
there was such a thing as fashion in dress it is as much as he did;
but he was quite sure that Anne's sleeves did not look at all like the
sleeves the other girls wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls
he had seen around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue
and pink and white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so
plainly and soberly gowned.

Of course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was
bringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be
served thereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have
one pretty dress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew
decided that he would give her one; that surely could not be objected
to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a
fortnight off. A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present.
Matthew, with a sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to
bed, while Marilla opened all the doors and aired the house.

The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the
dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It
would be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things
Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he
would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's
dress.

After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson's store
instead of William Blair's. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone
to William Blair's; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with
them as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But
William Blair's two daughters frequently waited on customers there and
Matthew held them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with
them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but
in such a matter as this, requiring explanation and consultation,
Matthew felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter. So he
would go to Lawson's, where Samuel or his son would wait on him.

Alas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his
business, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife's
and a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping
pompadour, big, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and
bewildering smile. She was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore
several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with
every movement of her hands. Matthew was covered with confusion at
finding her there at all; and those bangles completely wrecked his
wits at one fell swoop.

"What can I do for you this evening. Mr. Cuthbert?" Miss Lucilla
Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with
both hands.

"Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?" stammered
Matthew.

Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a
man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.

"I believe we have one or two left over," she said, "but they're
upstairs in the lumber-room. I'll go and see."

During her absence Matthew collected his scattered senses for another
effort.

When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:
"Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?" Matthew took his courage in
both hands and replied: "Well now, since you suggest it, I might as
well--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed."

Miss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded
that he was entirely crazy.

"We only keep hayseed in the spring," she explained loftily. "We've
none on hand just now."

"Oh, certainly--certainly--just as you say," stammered unhappy
Matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he
recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.
While Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers
for a final desperate attempt.

"Well now--if it isn't too much trouble--I might as well--that is--I'd
like to look at--at--some sugar."

"White or brown?" queried Miss Harris patiently.

"Oh--well now--brown," said Matthew feebly.

"There's a barrel of it over there," said Miss Harris, shaking her
bangles at it. "It's the only kind we have."

"I'll--I'll take twenty pounds of it," said Matthew, with beads of
perspiration standing on his forehead.

Matthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It
had been a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought,
for committing the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached
home he hid the rake in the tool-house, but the sugar he carried in to
Marilla.

"Brown sugar!" exclaimed Marilla. "Whatever possessed you to get so
much? You know I never use it except for the hired man's porridge or
black fruit-cake. Jerry's gone and I've made my cake long ago. It's
not good sugar, either--it's coarse and dark--William Blair doesn't
usually keep sugar like that."

"I--I thought it might come in handy sometime," said Matthew, making
good his escape.

When Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was
required to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question.
Matthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once.
Remained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would
Matthew have dared to ask advice. To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly,
and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man's
hands.

"Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I'm going
to Carmody tomorrow and I'll attend to it. Have you something
particular in mind? No? Well, I'll just go by my own judgment then. I
believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has
some new gloria in that's real pretty. Perhaps you'd like me to make
it up for her, too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would
probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise? Well,
I'll do it. No, it isn't a mite of trouble. I like sewing. I'll make
it to fit my niece, Jenny Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two
peas as far as figure goes."

"Well now, I'm much obliged," said Matthew, "and--and--I dunno--but
I'd like--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what
they used to be. If it wouldn't be asking too much I--I'd like them
made in the new way."

"Puffs? Of course. You needn't worry a speck more about it, Matthew.
I'll make it up in the very latest fashion," said Mrs. Lynde. To
herself she added when Matthew had gone:

"It'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something
decent for once. The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous,
that's what, and I've ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times. I've
held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn't want advice and
she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all
she's an old maid. But that's always the way. Folks that has brought
up children know that there's no hard and fast method in the world
that'll suit every child. But them as never have think it's all as
plain and easy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so
fashion, and the sum'll work out correct. But flesh and blood don't
come under the head of arithmetic and that's where Marilla Cuthbert
makes her mistake. I suppose she's trying to cultivate a spirit of
humility in Anne by dressing her as she does: but it's more likely to
cultivate envy and discontent. I'm sure the child must feel the
difference between her clothes and the other girls'. But to think of
Matthew taking notice of it! That man is waking up after being asleep
for over sixty years."

Marilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on
his mind, but what it was she could not guess, until Christmas Eve,
when Mrs. Lynde brought up the new dress. Marilla behaved pretty well
on the whole, although it is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde's
diplomatic explanation that she had made the dress because Matthew was
afraid Anne would find out about it too soon if Marilla made it.

"So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and
grinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?" she said a little
stiffly but tolerantly. "I knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I
must say I don't think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three
good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer
extravagance. There's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a
waist, I declare there is. You'll just pamper Anne's vanity, Matthew,
and she's as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she'll be satisfied
at last, for I know she's been hankering after those silly sleeves
ever since they came in, although she never said a word after the
first. The puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right
along; they're as big as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears
them will have to go through a door sideways."

Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very
mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but
just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne
peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs
in the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches and
wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the ploughed fields were
stretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that
was glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice re-echoed
through Green Gables.

"Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn't it a lovely
Christmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't
seem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're _not_
green--they're just nasty faded browns and greys. What makes people
call them green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!"

Matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and
held it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be
contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene
out of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.

Anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how
pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk;
a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately
pin-tucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy
lace at the neck. But the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long
elbow cuffs, and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of
shirring and bows of brown silk ribbon.

"That's a Christmas present for you, Anne," said Matthew shyly.
"Why--why--Anne, don't you like it? Well now--well now."

For Anne's eyes had suddenly filled with tears.

"_Like_ it! Oh, Matthew!" Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped
her hands. "Matthew, it's perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank
you enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a
happy dream."

"Well, well, let us have breakfast," interrupted Marilla. "I must say,
Anne, I don't think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it
for you, see that you take good care of it. There's a hair ribbon Mrs.
Lynde left for you. It's brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in."

"I don't see how I'm going to eat breakfast," said Anne rapturously.
"Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I'd rather
feast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are
still fashionable. It did seem to me that I'd never get over it if
they went out before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt
quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the
ribbon, too. I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It's
at times like this I'm sorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always
resolve that I will be in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out
your resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really
will make an extra effort after this."

When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the
white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson
ulster. Anne flew down the slope to meet her.

"Merry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it's a wonderful Christmas. I've
something splendid to show you. Matthew has given me the loveliest
dress, with _such_ sleeves. I couldn't even imagine any nicer."

"I've got something more for you," said Diana breathlessly.
"Here--this box. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so
many things in it--and this is for you. I'd have brought it over last
night, but it didn't come until after dark, and I never feel very
comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now."

Anne opened the box and peeped in. First a card with "For the
Anne-girl and Merry Christmas," written on it; and then, a pair of the
daintiest little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and
glistening buckles.

"Oh," said Anne, "Diana, this is too much, I must be dreaming."

"_I_ call it providential," said Diana. "You won't have to borrow
Ruby's slippers now, and that's a blessing, for they're two sizes too
big for you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie
Pye would be delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye
from the practice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal
to that?"

All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for
the hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.

The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The
little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but
Anne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in
the shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny.

"Oh, hasn't it been a brilliant evening?" sighed Anne, when it was all
over and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry
sky.

"Everything went off very well," said Diana practically. "I guess we
must have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to
send an account of it to the Charlottetown papers."

"Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill
to think of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder
than you did when it was encored. I just said to myself, 'It is my
dear bosom friend who is so honoured.'"

"Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad
one was simply splendid."

"Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I
really cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a
million eyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful
moment I was sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely
puffed sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those
sleeves, Diana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from
ever so far away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I
practised those recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never
have been able to get through. Did I groan all right?"

"Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely," assured Diana.

"I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was
splendid to think I had touched somebody's heart. It's so romantic to
take part in a concert isn't it? Oh, it's been a very memorable
occasion indeed."

"Wasn't the boys' dialogue fine?" said Diana. "Gilbert Blythe was just
splendid. Anne, I do think it's awful mean the way you treat Gil. Wait
till I tell you. When you ran off the platform after the fairy
dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil pick it up
and put it in his breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that
I'm sure you ought to be pleased at that."

"It's nothing to me what that person does," said Anne loftily. "I
simply never waste a thought on him, Diana."

That night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the
first time in twenty years, sat for awhile by the kitchen fire after
Anne had gone to bed.

"Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them," said Matthew
proudly.

"Yes, she did," admitted Marilla. "She's a bright child, Matthew. And
she looked real nice, too. I've been kind of opposed to this concert
scheme, but I suppose there's no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I
was proud of Anne tonight, although I'm not going to tell her so."

"Well now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so 'fore she went
upstairs," said Matthew. "We must see what we can do for her some of
these days, Marilla. I guess she'll need something more than Avonlea
school by and by."

"There's time enough to think of that," said Marilla. "She's only
thirteen in March. Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a
big girl. Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes
Anne look so tall. She's quick to learn and I guess the best thing we
can do for her will be to send her to Queen's after a spell. But
nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet."

"Well now, it'll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on," said
Matthew. "Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking
over."


Missy's Room


Mrs. Falconer and Miss Bailey walked home together through the fine
blue summer afternoon from the Ladies' Aid meeting at Mrs. Robinson's.
They were talking earnestly; that is to say, Miss Bailey was talking
earnestly and volubly, and Mrs. Falconer was listening. Mrs. Falconer
had reduced the practice of listening to a fine art. She was a thin,
wistful-faced mite of a woman, with sad brown eyes, and with
snow-white hair that was a libel on her fifty-five years and girlish
step. Nobody in Lindsay ever felt very well acquainted with Mrs.
Falconer, in spite of the fact that she had lived among them forty
years. She kept between her and her world a fine, baffling reserve
which no one had ever been able to penetrate. It was known that she
had had a bitter sorrow in her life, but she never made any reference
to it, and most people in Lindsay had forgotten it. Some foolish ones
even supposed that Mrs. Falconer had forgotten it.

"Well, I do not know what on earth is to be done with Camilla Clark,"
said Miss Bailey, with a prodigious sigh. "I suppose that we will
simply have to trust the whole matter to Providence."

Miss Bailey's tone and sigh really seemed to intimate to the world at
large that Providence was a last resort and a very dubious one. Not
that Miss Bailey meant anything of the sort; her faith was as
substantial as her works, which were many and praiseworthy and
seasonable.

The case of Camilla Clark was agitating the Ladies' Aid of one of the
Lindsay churches. They had talked about it through the whole of that
afternoon session while they sewed for their missionary box--talked
about it, and come to no conclusion.

In the preceding spring James Clark, one of the hands in the lumber
mill at Lindsay, had been killed in an accident. The shock had proved
nearly fatal to his young wife. The next day Camilla Clark's baby was
born dead, and the poor mother hovered for weeks between life and
death. Slowly, very slowly, life won the battle, and Camilla came back
from the valley of the shadow. But she was still an invalid, and would
be so for a long time.

The Clarks had come to Lindsay only a short time before the accident.
They were boarding at Mrs. Barry's when it happened, and Mrs. Barry
had shown every kindness and consideration to the unhappy young widow.
But now the Barrys were very soon to leave Lindsay for the West, and
the question was, what was to be done with Camilla Clark? She could
not go west; she could not even do work of any sort yet in Lindsay;
she had no relatives or friends in the world; and she was absolutely
penniless. As she and her husband had joined the church to which the
aforesaid Ladies' Aid belonged, the members thereof felt themselves
bound to take up her case and see what could be done for her.

The obvious solution was for some of them to offer her a home until
such time as she would be able to go to work. But there did not seem
to be anyone who could offer to do this--unless it was Mrs. Falconer.
The church was small, and the Ladies' Aid smaller. There were only
twelve members in it; four of these were unmarried ladies who boarded,
and so were helpless in the matter; of the remaining eight seven had
large families, or sick husbands, or something else that prevented
them from offering Camilla Clark an asylum. Their excuses were all
valid; they were good, sincere women who would have taken her in if
they could, but they could not see their way clear to do so. However,
it was probable they would eventually manage it in some way if Mrs.
Falconer did not rise to the occasion.

Nobody liked to ask Mrs. Falconer outright to take Camilla Clark in,
yet everyone thought she might offer. She was comfortably off, and
though her house was small, there was nobody to live in it except
herself and her husband. But Mrs. Falconer sat silent through all the
discussion of the Ladies' Aid, and never opened her lips on the
subject of Camilla Clark despite the numerous hints which she
received.

Miss Bailey made one more effort as aforesaid. When her despairing
reference to Providence brought forth no results, she wished she dared
ask Mrs. Falconer openly to take Camilla Clark, but somehow she did
not dare. There were not many things that could daunt Miss Bailey, but
Mrs. Falconer's reserve and gentle aloofness always could.

When Miss Bailey had gone on down the village street, Mrs. Falconer
paused for a few moments at her gate, apparently lost in deep thought.
She was perfectly well aware of all the hints that had been thrown out
for her benefit that afternoon. She knew that the Aids, one and all,
thought that she ought to take Camilla Clark. But she had no room to
give her--for it was out of the question to think of putting her in
Missy's room.

"I couldn't do such a thing," she said to herself piteously. "They
don't understand--they can't understand--but I _couldn't_ give her
Missy's room. I'm sorry for poor Camilla, and I wish I could help her.
But I can't give her Missy's room, and I have no other."

The little Falconer cottage, set back from the road in the green
seclusion of an apple orchard and thick, leafy maples, was a very tiny
one. There were just two rooms downstairs and two upstairs. When Mrs.
Falconer entered the kitchen an old-looking man with long white hair
and mild blue eyes looked up with a smile from the bright-coloured
blocks before him.

"Have you been lonely, Father?" said Mrs. Falconer tenderly.

He shook his head, still smiling.

"No, not lonely. These"--pointing to the blocks--"are so pretty. See
my house, Mother."

This man was Mrs. Falconer's husband. Once he had been one of the
smartest, most intelligent men in Lindsay, and one of the most trusted
employees of the railroad company. Then there had been a train
collision. Malcolm Falconer was taken out of the wreck fearfully
injured. He eventually recovered physical health, but he was from that
time forth merely a child in intellect--a harmless, kindly creature,
docile and easily amused.

Mrs. Falconer tried to dismiss the thought of Camilla Clark from her
mind, but it would not be dismissed. Her conscience reproached her
continually. She tried to compromise with it by saying that she would
go down and see Camilla that evening and take her some nice fresh
Irish moss jelly. It was so good for delicate people.

She found Camilla alone in the Barry sitting-room, and noticed with a
feeling that was almost like self-reproach how thin and frail and
white the poor young creature looked. Why, she seemed little more
than a child! Her great dark eyes were far too big for her wasted
face, and her hands were almost transparent.

"I'm not much better yet," said Camilla tremulously, in response to
Mrs. Falconer's inquiries. "Oh, I'm so slow getting well! And I
know--I feel that I'm a burden to everybody."

"But you mustn't think that, dear," said Mrs. Falconer, feeling more
uncomfortable than ever. "We are all glad to do all we can for you."

Mrs. Falconer paused suddenly. She was a very truthful woman and she
instantly realized that that last sentence was not true. She was not
doing all she could for Camilla--she would not be glad, she feared, to
do all she could.

"If I were only well enough to go to work," sighed Camilla. "Mr. Marks
says I can have a place in the shoe factory whenever I'm able to. But
it will be so long yet. Oh, I'm so tired and discouraged!"

She put her hands over her face and sobbed. Mrs. Falconer caught her
breath. What if Missy were somewhere alone in the world--ill,
friendless, with never a soul to offer her a refuge or a shelter? It
was so very, very probable. Before she could check herself Mrs.
Falconer spoke. "My dear, don't cry! I want you to come and stay with
me until you get perfectly well. You won't be a speck of trouble, and
I'll be glad to have you for company."

Mrs. Falconer's Rubicon was crossed. She could not draw back now if
she wanted to. But she was not at all sure that she did want to. By
the time she reached home she was sure she didn't want to. And yet--to
give Missy's room to Camilla! It seemed a great sacrifice to Mrs.
Falconer.

She went up to it the next morning with firmly set lips to air and
dust it. It was just the same as when Missy had left it long ago.
Nothing had ever been moved or changed, but everything had always been
kept beautifully neat and clean. Snow-white muslin curtains hung
before the small square window. In one corner was a little white bed.
Missy's pictures hung on the walls; Missy's books and work-basket were
lying on the square stand; there was a bit of half-finished fancy
work, yellow from age, lying in the basket. Here! Lancelot. Tell him
that a Postillon of my Lord comes, his horn full of good news is:
my Lord will be here before morning. (From Lancelot.) Lorenzo. Come,
sweet heart, we expect them indoors. And However, it does not
matter: what hineingehn? friend Stephano, I ask you, in the same house

How sweet the moonlight sleeps on the hill! Here sit and we let the
music For Ohre slip; gentle nursing and night, true to the sounds of

To Goldreif a dürftgen ring, she gave me, the Denkspruch it was
exactly the way verse 'on a knife blade from the blacksmith: "Love me
and let me not."
A woman came to
Peterboro and claimed to be Bert Williams's wife--and she was--she
proved it. Bert cleared out and was never seen again in these parts.
As soon as we heard about it Father relented, and I went right down
to Peterboro to see Missy and bring her home. But she wasn't
there--she had gone, nobody knew where. I got a letter from her the
next week. She said her heart was broken, and she knew we would never
forgive her, and she couldn't face the disgrace, so she was going away
where nobody would ever find her. We did everything we could to trace
her, but we never could. We've never heard from her since, and it is
fifteen years ago. Sometimes I am afraid she is dead, but then again I
feel sure she isn't. Oh, Camilla, if I could only find my poor child
and bring her home!

"This was her room. And when she went away I made up my mind I would
keep it for her just as she left it, and I have up to now. Nobody has
ever been inside the door but myself. I've always hoped that Missy
would come home, and I would lead her up here and say, 'Missy, here is
your room just as you left it, and here is your place in your mother's
heart just as you left it,' But she never came. I'm afraid she never
will."

Mrs. Falconer dropped her face in her hands and sobbed softly. Camilla
came over to her and put her arms about her.

"I think she will," she said. "I think--I am sure your love and
prayers will bring Missy home yet. And I understand how good you have
been in giving me her room--oh, I know what it must have cost you! I
will pray tonight that God will bring Missy back to you."

When Mrs. Falconer returned to the kitchen to close the house for the
night, her husband being already sound asleep; she heard a low, timid
knock at the door. Wondering who it could be so late, she opened it.
The light fell on a shrinking, shabby figure on the step, and on a
pale, pinched face in which only a mother could have recognized the
features of her child. Mrs. Falconer gave a cry.

"Missy! Missy! Missy!"

She caught the poor wanderer to her heart and drew her in.

"Oh, Missy, Missy, have you come back at last? Thank God! Oh, thank
God!"

"I _had_ to come back. I was starving for a glimpse of your face and
of the old home, Mother," sobbed Missy. "But I didn't mean you should
know--I never meant to show myself to you. I've been sick, and just as
soon as I got better I came here. I meant to creep home after dark and
look at the dear old house, and perhaps get a glimpse of you and
Father through the window if you were still here. I didn't know if you
were. And then I meant to go right away on the night train. I was
under the window and I heard you telling my story to someone. Oh,
Mother, when I knew that you had forgiven me, that you loved me still
and had always kept my room for me, I made up my mind that I'd show
myself to you."

The mother had got her child into a rocking-chair and removed the
shabby hat and cloak. How ill and worn and faded Missy looked! Yet her
face was pure and fine, and there was in it something sweeter than had
ever been there in her beautiful girlhood.

"I'm terribly changed, am I not, Mother?" said Missy, with a faint
smile. "I've had a hard life--but an honest one, Mother. When I went
away I was almost mad with the disgrace my wilfulness had brought on
you and Father and myself. I went as far as I could get away from you,
and I got work in a factory. I've worked there ever since, just making
enough to keep body and soul together. Oh, I've starved for a word
from you--the sight of your face! But I thought Father would spurn me
from his door if I should ever dare to come back."

"Oh, Missy!" sobbed the mother. "Your poor father is just like a
child. He got a terrible hurt ten years ago, and never got over it. I
don't suppose he'll even know you--he's clean forgot everything. But
he forgave you before it happened. You poor child, you're done right
out. You're too weak to be travelling. But never mind, you're home
now, and I'll soon nurse you up. I'll put on the kettle and get you a
good cup of tea first thing. And you're not to do any more talking
till the morning. But, oh, Missy, I can't take you to your own room
after all. Camilla Clark has it, and she'll be asleep by now; we
mustn't disturb her, for she's been real sick. I'll fix up a bed for
you on the sofa, though. Missy, Missy, let us kneel down here and
thank God for His mercy!"

Late that night, when Missy had fallen asleep in her improvised bed,
the wakeful mother crept in to gloat over her.

"Just to think," she whispered, "if I hadn't taken Camilla Clark in,
Missy wouldn't have heard me telling about the room, and she'd have
gone away again and never have known. Oh, I don't deserve such a
blessing when I was so unwilling to take Camilla! But I know one
thing: this is going to be Camilla's home. There'll be no leaving it
even when she does get well. She shall be my daughter, and I'll love
her next to Missy."


Ted's Afternoon Off


Ted was up at five that morning, as usual. - And clearly you answered
that it was impossible to ask. - For this reason I ask ... Now that
same desire. - I do not agree with that answer my question. There
was now living as you live, and here is another way of living very
different. - Then call the ax, and with all this. - I I can not even
call it that. - And dale, Jesus Lord, with Matraca! How do you
want, the soul of God, that you tell? - In Castilian current ...
right ... streets without escape. - By !...-- life and here was a
moment of impatience of the wizards I have seen in women, and
even gave two pats on the lap, then the primary head irguiendo
tightening and a little voice and gesture, he added -: In addition
and settlement, what obligation do I have to declare it, or what
matters to the Usté know?

pretended to take seriously and as a hard lesson, and these words
just replied I apologize to them for daring ... Then let the
other picaruela laughter, and said in a tone that showed the greatest
desire to casual, if perchance I had been really upset me: - Now
that the shock will punish the mischief, because it is mischief,
and large, the pump for a woman who never had the thoughts ...

But Tochon Me! - Exclaimed suddenly crossing their hands and the face
compungiendo -. ¿Well, I'm not jarana as a silly, just as if it
had not mourn why not rest in this house? What Usté tell me, Mr Don
Marcelo? Go, go, another simple as I do! And see if I can forgive,
not even my entire fault. With this the very elusive and come Taiman
Mari Pepa, ended the conversation. But I had no doubt that it was
Neluco mobile, type and regulator of all the ambitions of the
granddaughter of Don Pedro Nolasco. Some are not neglected when the
preparations for the funeral.

It was the account of Don Sabas alert Archpriest of all priests and
many more, if you could, and with his direction and with the doctor,
and even with his material, I wrote or signed letters and more
letters, giving an account of the death of my uncle and the date their
funeral in the parish church of Tablanca, all semblance of the people
of the province, which in the opinion of those friends, should know.
Women, while providing the opportunity to reach the pantry what it was
missing, and spent magazine recounted, hands and utensils admonished
for "meal" of that great occasion, and the first near desnieve out
of themselves in all directions, and, while they, the message that
the pedestrian was in the bag warnings that they could not distribute
their own.

And in this light the sun very often, women became gray to make their
own and wonder at every turn with his anguished eyes, not daring
to do so by word, what would stop the night unless it thought it
had been pending in the death of his master.

The truth is that I, if I had not missed entirely forgotten, but after
thinking better and link it with recent events that had so radically
transformed the way of being in that house, it was very careless, and
even caused me some ruborcillo recall the importance that it
had reached the deal, perhaps for suggestions hysterical spasms
of poor Facia. once responded to his eyes speaking in this sense
to better reassure her, but I could not figure out if what I got
proposed, because the commitment me that he had acquired on how to
behave in that case, do not let me forward to the truth of their
feelings.

But if any trust my words inspired him that day, it took very little
to the poor, because the next morning after a night of torrential rain,
the sun appeared radiant in a sky without clouds, and the valley floor
and slopes stripped from the mountains in a hurry for the white
and thick sheaths, which, converted into crystalline streams and
murmurantes, raced through grass and plunging into the regatta at
the Alvear Nansa, already filled to the edges of the weeds, which
would leave River load their scum.

XXX sign was also really well drawn!! that day for the house of Tablanca
and for the people. The same gigantón of Castañalera assured me
that with the roads being impassable and ports desnevar a half, those
were the most pompous funerals that were held in the parish, as
he could remember (and that the extent of their verging memories
went with a century), so far, in particular the number and quality
of competing outsiders.

Among the clergy, which was very large, came from the most famous
funeral song in the vicarage, and therefore not miss
the pastor of Zarzaleda, a specialty that was very admirable, and not
without reason, without foundation, for the tone _Dies irae_ his
voice atenorada and vibrant, that it was hair-raising to the faithful
hardest to shake, and also attended many of these priests to their
parishioners, without any personal relationship or kinship with
the deceased, were ardent admirers of his good reputation.

But this was not contingent, nor so large or the noise espelurciadas
moved their horses in the streets of the place, which drew more
attention to it, but the other contingent of the gentlemen who came to
the mansion for All the paths of the surrounding mountains.

Chisco Salces Pito and helped to dismantle not brought espolique,
which were the most, and seized their horses and Pedro Nolasco
Neluco they went out to meet me on the stairs and then submit them
to me at the door of the Salona, from which led to my cabinet, which
had to be returned by that day, or room podium of honor, and in
whose center table was a feast of wines soletilla and biscuits,
with which once provided concluded as greetings and courtesies of
the heading, subject to Mari Pepa and then came his daughter, already
dressed and well dressed for the holiday, although luctuosa to offer
something of more substance, for if they were fasting, such as milk,
broth or chocolate ... or lean ham with eggs stars, but opted for
wine copeja biscuits, "reserving for later ...».

"After" was the midday meal, the funeral ended. For all those gentlemen
were my guests, alerted to this condition, and even without it ...
and even without any warning. Sufficient to authorize the practice,
and be friends of the house into a mortuary lugarejo so dismantled as
one, to justify the practice. To receive and entertain the clergy,
made a little and badly cooked, was responsible for my own account and
order, and Also according to another custom, the priest Don Sabas,
the other lot of strangers, no one used to care, and nobody cared
there either. Yet, on the condition of my guests, although relatively
rare, and so I forced the mine was necessary to throw the rest in the
mansion, and nobody would believe not see it as I see it, revealing
the amount and sweats that came to represent that job, which turned
the home and workplace, the people who were put in motion, the
leagues were beaten path for good walkers, and those stolen hours
sleep and to rest more than one night, and in spite of the fact and
the "guisanderas" a time that helped women home in the hardest of
the tasks undertaken and, God knows what would have been a solemn
and critical time, without continuous monitoring and the admirable
foresight and diligence of my two benefactors fairies ... and her
sister Neluco. ínclita Because Robacío midwife was Tablanca from
the previous day.

He had arrived the evening with her husband, and "the haunches. So
went home to Neluco; halláronla closed, and after the Don Pedro
Nolasco; the mozona he said that it served what was happening, and
bent toward the house, without any pity the poor hack who already
broke the spine and was sunk to spend the last breath when climbing
the rocky. When the two friends meet in the middle of carrejo,
enzarzáronse in an embrace so intimate and tight that it seemed a
"engarra 'ate a kiss, and kiss and kiss said the greatest atrocities,
Lita came with his grandfather, and the scene was repeated until
the end of Robacío to look at me and began to mourn the deceased,
so willingly, that appeared to be no consolation to her, while her
husband, who had greeted me, made their respective pots, and wipe
his eyes with her apron and Lita mother, who was his very tender-hearted
and catchy of tears.

Acabóse the din, for the mine under a spell with as quickly as it had
erupted, and we went together towards Salona and holy peace, but not
silent. Upon arriving Neluco another bang his sister, not your
mouth closed all night and wanted to leave the mansion since he
knew he had the busy there. Is fully perished by those things, and
kill the calm. Moreover, the roads were not very appetizing to say
to a woman of her flesh ventured stepped on at night without a
great need, not to mention that she had to cause distress or extortion
in the house, either because they knew Mari Pepa, in joining the
two, they always' round bed.

"Thus for those reasons and slept there, and went alone, after dinner,
her husband and home Neluco it. The first arrived early the next day
were two relatives of the woman who was my Uncle Celso, the Sanchez
del Pinar in Caórnica, on the banks of Sakha. Were a very tall and
the other very low: the two thick gray sideburns, just laughing
both loquacious and nothing.

I was embarrassed - and told me to enter - visit and offer their respects
for the first time on this sad occasion; thus locked in its valley,
which is not never left without a source of great rides, a little
ignorance of events and a bit of skill by the "leave for another
day business ...».

Anyway, there were available to them at my convenience, as it
could have other comparientes there, that they had not been
accompanied, for whom lack of health, who by the beast. All had much
to Don Celso and were highly addictive, although he molested little.
Without finish just sit these characters appeared in the Salona
another aspect which surprised me a lot.

Was higher than that of Caórnica; Luengas and pointed beard of white,
brown color, very prominent and aquiline nose, tiny eyes and bristling
eyebrows and green and white, her head covered with a high cylindrical
hat of beaver fur, and whole body to the feet, with a gray cloth
capotón.

It looked like a magician. Took off his hat and was stripped of the
cloak as they approached me, and left exposed a thicket of white hair,
rices and tight, and an old dress form with respect to the current
figures, good cloth, yes, but very and colorless. The man was from the
cliffs of Deva, and it was the famous Don Recaredo, of whom I had
great news for my Uncle, hidalgo rancio of solar celibate unrepentant,
famed hunter of wild beasts, and great and deserved influence
throughout its region ; good relationships with men from the bustle
of the capital and political branches of it, in great demand,
aspiring to representation in the district courts, in times of
electoral magazine business ... and primary hobby carpenter, only
well-established that he was known and with which entertained the
solitudes and holganzas of his life in the old house they inhabit.

Behind Recaredo gift came from a stroke, have been joined by
some on the road and all at the door of the house, up to five wealthy,
more or less bound to her by former distant kinship or friendship, to
the shores of Nansa, upstream and downstream. Then these appeared Salona
in two other major characters in mind that I imposed for its
apostura and atalajes, so different from everything that was there
and what is around me at the time.

It was none other than the illustrious gentleman Don Román Pérez
Llosía and the son-in-law of Don Álvaro the War.

Iban from Santander, where he resided, and had made the trip in two days.
The truth to all: I am so far dominated the scene in which consciousness
rid of "worth more" in the scale of education and intellectual
culture, to see me in front of those two competing for such a
distinguished and elegant porte I felt that I was far down the smoke
from the chimney to bring in appropriate clothing, particularly in
comparison with that played the handsome son of señorón and
correctísimo of Coteruco.

I was quite awkward to express gratitude to them for that act was so
honorable to the memory of my uncle, and the satisfaction that I felt
possessed to shake hands with some people from so many who had great
news since I had Tablanca reached.

I remember that this was the topic of my polite response to the
greetings of the two knights, but not what I said.

What I am sure of is that you have very badly. Take the truth.

Without giving me time to ask Don Román (which I avoided probably
committing a great impertinence) walked up to what their intention
to return to Coteruco, another character appeared on the scene of
the first class, and which embraced a genuine outpouring of my soul:
the Lord of perínclito Tower Provedaño, that to reach the hour
arrived, Recaredo as a gift to get from the cliffs of the Deva and
Caórnica from the valley, had needed to walk night midway, and that
way!

So he came, his face breaking Lumbres made between the lips and
beards and mustaches bristling with icicles. What had happened before
and that came from here, by all known treatment, or at least name,
then went there, but with the notable difference that the repair
of Provedaño in the Coteruco, not over all in the handshake or
affectionate family and mutual palmoteos in the back, but moved and
yearning both, said a word, they embraced so closely, that seemed
not to get separated.

Then it was the turn of Don Alvaro, who was not so friendly to
Campoo with his stepfather, and under this law was an expression
of greeting.

For little more than the compliments he gave me the time, not yet had
returned to sit half the people there, when he came to Don Sabas message
that everything was ready in the church and we waited.

As they were close to ten and not last the funeral less than two
hours, and outsiders had to go home after eating at the mine, and the
evenings were very short, we got up immediately, and accompanied
Neluco also her sister and Mari Pepa very bereaved.

Old Marmitón not let you leave. To have the table and direct you and
sort everything Lituca which was painted only for this and
other even more.

Chisco and also stayed with two other Salces Pito mozones my confidence,
well aware of many care for me, particularly the surveillance, because
I do not know if I spontaneously went into the occurrence, or because
they inspired me a look of elocuentísima Women gray, to see how it
would remain the house, without us, helpless and less than empty.
Walking into the church and we saw suddenly appear on the rocky
jiba, a tall and sturdy man, with a beautiful head, caught between
a chambergo of broad wings and a gray beard, was a body with a
brown reefer, and trousers of the same color, roll up on some
borceguíes be of sole and very muddy.

She brought his hands tucked into the pockets of reefer, a paint
stick and knotted below the left arm and mouth smoking a pipe.

The first thing you knew was the lord of Provedaño, running from the
front over here. She stopped a moment to look singing with hand on
forehead, and also stopped the other with dark eyes and unflappable
nailed it. Two lions appeared.

I will not miss more than smelled. After closer and closer to the skilled
reece shocks. Then I found two pairs of the mountain oaks shaken by
the breath of a single burst. I do not know what was said or if they
said something. Why?

In these questions I saw Don Román Pérez Llosía of out as an arrow, from
the weakest of the group that descended toward the man who went up, and
this, to discover that he was coming from Coteruco, off of his right
hand the campurriano and took off with it the martial chambergo
and uncover the spacious front and white, which appeared on the
reflected light ray then dropped his eyes.

Everybody in Bridgeport liked him, but only
a very few ever passed the inner gates of his confidence or were
admitted to any share in his real life. I am proud to say I was one; I
think it is something for an old woman to boast of.

Doctor John was always fond of children, and they of him. It was
natural that he and little Marcella should take to each other. He had
the most to do with bringing her up, for Miss Sara consulted him in
everything. Marcella was not hard to manage for the most part; but she
had a will of her own, and when she did set it up in opposition to
the powers that were, nobody but the doctor could influence her at
all; she never resisted him or disobeyed his wishes.

Marcella was one of those girls who develop early. I suppose her
constant association with us elderly folks had something to do with
it, too. But, at fifteen, she was a woman, loving, beautiful, and
spirited.

And Doctor John loved her--loved the woman, not the child. I knew it
before he did--but not, as I think, before Marcella did, for those
young, straight-gazing eyes of hers were wonderfully quick to read
into other people's hearts. I watched them together and saw the love
growing between them, like a strong, fair, perfect flower, whose
fragrance was to endure for eternity. Miss Sara saw it, too, and was
half-pleased and half-worried; even Miss Sara thought the Doctor too
old for Marcella; and besides, there were the Barrys to be reckoned
with. Those Barrys were the nightmare dread of poor Miss Sara's life.

The time came when Doctor John's eyes were opened. He looked into his
own heart and read there what life had written for him. As he told me
long afterwards, it came to him with a shock that left him
white-lipped. But he was a brave, sensible fellow and he looked the
matter squarely in the face. First of all, he put away to one side all
that the world might say; the thing concerned solely him and Marcella,
and the world had nothing to do with it. That disposed of, he asked
himself soberly if he had a right to try to win Marcella's love. He
decided that he had not; it would be taking an unfair advantage of her
youth and inexperience. He knew that she must soon go to her father's
people--she must not go bound by any ties of his making. Doctor John,
for Marcella's sake, gave the decision against his own heart.

So much did Doctor John tell me, his old friend and confidant. I said
nothing and gave no advice, not having lived seventy-five years for
nothing. I knew that Doctor John's decision was manly and right and
fair; but I also knew it was all nullified by the fact that Marcella
already loved him.

So much I knew; the rest I was left to suppose. The Doctor and
Marcella told me much, but there were some things too sacred to be
told, even to me. So that to this day I don't know how the doctor
found out that Marcella loved him. All I know is that one day, just a
month before her sixteenth birthday, the two came hand in hand to Miss
Sara and me, as we sat on Miss Sara's veranda in the twilight, and
told us simply that they had plighted their troth to each other.

I looked at them standing there with that wonderful sunrise of life
and love on their faces--the doctor, tall and serious, with a sprinkle
of silver in his brown hair and the smile of a happy man on his
lips--Marcella, such a slip of a girl, with her black hair in a long
braid and her lovely face all dewed over with tears and sunned over
with smiles--I, an old woman, looked at them and thanked the good God
for them and their delight.

Miss Sara laughed and cried and kissed--and forboded what the Barrys
would do. Her forebodings proved only too true. When the doctor wrote
to Richard Barry, Marcella's guardian, asking his consent to their
engagement, Richard Barry promptly made trouble--the very worst kind
of trouble. He descended on Bridgeport and completely overwhelmed poor
Miss Sara in his wrath. He laughed at the idea of countenancing an
engagement between a child like Marcella and an obscure country
doctor. And he carried Marcella off with him!

She had to go, of course. He was her legal guardian and he would
listen to no pleadings. He didn't know anything about Marcella's
character, and he thought that a new life out in the great world would
soon blot out her fancy.

After the first outburst of tears and prayers Marcella took it very
calmly, as far as outward eye could see. She was as cool and dignified
and stately as a young queen. On the night before she went away she
came over to say good-bye to me. She did not even shed any tears, but
the look in her eyes told of bitter hurt. "It is goodbye for five
years, Miss Tranquil," she said steadily. "When I am twenty-one I will
come back. That is the only promise I can make. They will not let me
write to John or Aunt Sara and I will do nothing underhanded. But I
will not forget and I will come back."

Richard Barry would not even let her see Doctor John alone again. She
had to bid him good-bye beneath the cold, contemptuous eyes of the man
of the world. So there was just a hand-clasp and one long deep look
between them that was tenderer than any kiss and more eloquent than
any words.

"I will come back when I am twenty-one," said Marcella. And I saw
Richard Barry smile.

So Marcella went away and in all Bridgeport there were only two people
who believed she would ever return. There is no keeping a secret in
Bridgeport, and everybody knew all about the love affair between
Marcella and the doctor and about the promise she had made. Everybody
sympathized with the doctor because everybody believed he had lost his
sweetheart.

"For of course she'll never come back," said Mrs. Riddell to me.
"She's only a child and she'll soon forget him. She's to be sent to
school and taken abroad and between times she'll live with the Richard
Barrys; and they move, as everyone knows, in the very highest and
gayest circles. I'm sorry for the doctor, though. A man of his age
doesn't get over a thing like that in a hurry and he was perfectly
silly over Marcella. But it really serves him right for falling in
love with a child."

There are times when Martha Riddell gets on my nerves. She's a
good-hearted woman, and she means well; but she rasps--rasps terribly.

Even Miss Sara exasperated me. But then she had her excuse. The child
she loved as her own had been torn from her and it almost broke her
heart. But even so, I thought she ought to have had a little more
faith in Marcella.

"Oh, no, she'll never come back," sobbed Miss Sara. "Yes, I know she
promised. But they'll wean her away from me. She'll have such a gay,
splendid life she'll not want to come back. Five years is a lifetime
at her age. No, don't try to comfort me, Miss Tranquil, because I
_won't_ be comforted!"

When a person has made up her mind to be miserable you just have to
_let_ her be miserable.

I almost dreaded to see Doctor John for fear he would be in despair,
too, without any confidence in Marcella. But when he came I saw I
needn't have worried. The light had all gone out of his eyes, but
there was a calm, steady patience in them.

"She will come back to me, Miss Tranquil," he said. "I know what
people are saying, but that does not trouble me. They do not know
Marcella as I do. She promised and she will keep her word--keep it
joyously and gladly, too. If I did not know that I would not wish its
fulfilment. When she is free she will turn her back on that brilliant
world and all it offers her and come back to me. My part is to wait
and believe."

So Doctor John waited and believed. After a little while the
excitement died away and people forgot Marcella. We never heard from
or about her, except a paragraph now and then in the society columns
of the city paper the doctor took. We knew she was sent to school for
three years; then the Barrys took her abroad. She was presented at
court. When the doctor read this--he was with me at the time--he put
his hand over his eyes and sat very silent for a long time. I wondered
if at last some momentary doubt had crept into his mind--if he did not
fear that Marcella must have forgotten him. The paper told of her
triumph and her beauty and hinted at a titled match. Was it probable
or even possible that she would be faithful to him after all this?

The doctor must have guessed my thoughts, for at last he looked up
with a smile.

"She will come back," was all he said. But I saw that the doubt, if
doubt it were, had gone. I watched him as he went away, that tall,
gentle, kindly-eyed man, and I prayed that his trust might not be
misplaced; for if it should be it would break his heart.

Five years seems a long time in looking forward. But they pass
quickly. One day I remembered that it was Marcella's twenty-first
birthday. Only one other person thought of it. Even Miss Sara did not.
Miss Sara remembered Marcella only as a child that had been loved and
lost. Nobody else in Bridgeport thought about her at all. The doctor
came in that evening. He had a rose in his buttonhole and he walked
with a step as light as a boy's.

"She is free to-day," he said. "We shall soon have her again, Miss
Tranquil."

"Do you think she will be the same?" I said.

I don't know what made me say it. I hate to be one of those people who
throw cold water on other peoples' hopes. But it slipped out before I
thought. I suppose the doubt had been vaguely troubling me always,
under all my faith in Marcella, and now made itself felt in spite of
me.

But the doctor only laughed.

"How could she be changed?" he said. "Some women might be--most women
would be--but not Marcella. Dear Miss Tranquil, don't spoil your
beautiful record of confidence by doubting her now. We shall have her
again soon--how soon I don't know, for I don't even know where she is,
whether in the old world or the new--but just as soon as she can come
to us."

We said nothing more--neither of us. But every day the light in the
doctor's eyes grew brighter and deeper and tenderer. He never spoke of
Marcella, but I knew she was in his thoughts every moment. He was much
calmer than I was. I trembled when the postman knocked, jumped when
the gate latch clicked, and fairly had a cold chill if I saw a
telegraph boy running down the street.

One evening, a fortnight later, I went over to see Miss Sara. She was
out somewhere, so I sat down in her little sitting room to wait for
her. Presently the doctor came in and we sat in the soft twilight,
talking a little now and then, but silent when we wanted to be, as
becomes real friendship. It was such a beautiful evening. Outside in
Miss Sara's garden the roses were white and red, and sweet with dew;
the honeysuckle at the window sent in delicious breaths now and again;
a few sleepy birds were twittering; between the trees the sky was all
pink and silvery blue and there was an evening star over the elm in my
front yard. We heard somebody come through the door and down the hall.
I turned, expecting to see Miss Sara--and I saw Marcella! She was
standing in the doorway, tall and beautiful, with a ray of sunset
light falling athwart her black hair under her travelling hat. She was
looking past me at Doctor John and in her splendid eyes was the look
of the exile who had come home to her own.

"Marcella!" said the doctor.

I went out by the dining-room door and shut it behind me, leaving them
alone together.

The wedding is to be next month. Miss Sara is beside herself with
delight. The excitement has been really terrible, and the way people
have talked and wondered and exclaimed has almost worn my patience
clean out. I've snubbed more persons in the last ten days than I ever
did in all my life before.

Nothing of this worries Doctor John or Marcella. They are too happy to
care for gossip or outside curiosity. The Barrys are not coming to the
wedding, I understand. They refuse to forgive Marcella or countenance
her folly, as they call it, in any way. Folly! When I see those two
together and realize what they mean to each other I have some humble,
reverent idea of what true wisdom is.


The End of the Young Family Feud


A week before Christmas, Aunt Jean wrote to Elizabeth, inviting her
and Alberta and me to eat our Christmas dinner at Monkshead. We
accepted with delight. Aunt Jean and Uncle Norman were delightful
people, and we knew we should have a jolly time at their house.
Besides, we wanted to see Monkshead, where Father had lived in his
boyhood, and the old Young homestead where he had been born and
brought up and where Uncle William still lived. Father never said much
about it, but we knew he loved it very dearly, and we had always
greatly desired to get at least a glimpse of what Alberta liked to
call "our ancestral halls."

Since Monkshead was only sixty miles away, and Uncle William lived
there as aforesaid, it may be pertinently asked what there was to
prevent us from visiting it and the homestead as often as we wished.
We answer promptly: the family feud.

Father and Uncle William were on bad terms, or rather on no terms at
all, and had been ever since we could remember. After Grandfather
Young's death there had been a wretched quarrel over the property.
Father always said that he had been as much to blame as Uncle William,
but Great-aunt Emily told us that Uncle William had been by far the
most to blame, and that he had behaved scandalously to Father.
Moreover, she said that Father had gone to him when cooling-down time
came, apologized for what he had said, and asked Uncle William to be
friends again; and that William, simply turned his back on Father and
walked into the house without saying a word, but, as Great-aunt Emily
said, with the Young temper sticking out of every kink and curve of
his figure. Great-aunt Emily is our aunt on Mother's side, and she
does not like any of the Youngs except Father and Uncle Norman.

This was why we had never visited Monkshead. We had never seen Uncle
William, and we always thought of him as a sort of ogre when we
thought of him at all. When we were children, our old nurse, Margaret
Hannah, used to frighten us into good behaviour by saying ominously,
"If you 'uns aint good your Uncle William'll cotch you."

What he would do to us when he "cotched" us she never specified,
probably reasoning that the unknown was always more terrible than the
known. My private opinion in those days was that he would boil us in
oil and pick our bones.

Uncle Norman and Aunt Jean had been living out west for years. Three
months before this Christmas they had come east, bought a house in
Monkshead, and settled there. They had been down to see us, and Father
and Mother and the boys had been up to see them, but we three girls
had not; so we were pleasantly excited at the thought of spending
Christmas there.

Christmas morning was fine, white as a pearl and clear as a diamond.
We had to go by the seven o'clock train, since there was no other
before eleven, and we reached Monkshead at eight-thirty.

When we stepped from the train the stationmaster asked us if we were
the three Miss Youngs. Alberta pleaded guilty, and he said, "Well,
here's a letter for you then."

We took the letter and went into the waiting room with sundry
misgivings. What had happened? Were Uncle Norman and Aunt Jean
quarantined for scarlet fever, or had burglars raided the pantry and
carried off the Christmas supplies? Elizabeth opened and read the
letter aloud. It was from Aunt Jean to the following effect:

    DEAR GIRLS: I am so sorry to disappoint you, but I cannot help
    it. Word has come from Streatham that my sister has met with a
    serious accident and is in a very critical condition. Your
    uncle and I must go to Streatham immediately and are leaving
    on the eight o'clock express. I know you have started before
    this, so there is no use in telegraphing. We want you to go
    right to the house and make yourself at home. You will find
    the key under the kitchen doorstep, and the dinner in the
    pantry all ready to cook. There are two mince pies on the
    third shelf, and the plum pudding only needs to be warmed up.
    You will find a little Christmas remembrance for each of you
    on the dining-room table. I hope you will make as merry as you
    possibly can and we will have you down again as soon as we
    come back.

                              Your hurried and affectionate,
                                               AUNT JEAN


We looked at each other somewhat dolefully. But, as Alberta pointed
out, we might as well make the best of it, since there was no way of
getting home before the five o'clock train. So we trailed out to the
stationmaster, and asked him limply if he could direct us to Mr.
Norman Young's house.

He was a rather grumpy individual, very busy with pencil and notebook
over some freight; but he favoured us with his attention long enough
to point with his pencil and say jerkily, "Young's? See that red house
on the hill? That's it."

The red house was about a quarter of a mile from the station, and we
saw it plainly. Accordingly, to the red house we betook ourselves. On
nearer view it proved to be a trim, handsome place, with nice grounds
and very fine old trees.

We found the key under the kitchen doorstep and went in. The fire was
black out, and somehow things wore a more cheerless look than I had
expected to find. I may as well admit that we marched into the dining
room first of all, to find our presents.

There were three parcels, two very small and one pretty big, lying on
the table, but when we came to look for names there were none.

"Evidently Aunt Jean, in her hurry and excitement, forgot to label
them," said Elizabeth. "Let us open them. We may be able to guess from
the contents which belongs to whom."

I must say we were surprised when we opened those parcels. "We had
known that Aunt Jean's gifts would be nice, but we had not expected
anything like this. There was a magnificent stone marten collar, a
dear little gold watch and pearl chatelaine, and a gold chain bracelet
set with turquoises.

"The collar must be for you, Elizabeth, because Mary and I have one
already, and Aunt Jean knows it," said Alberta; "the watch must be for
you, Mary, because I have one; and by the process of exhaustion the
bracelet must be for me. Well, they are all perfectly sweet."

Elizabeth put on her collar and paraded in front of the sideboard
mirror. It was so dusty she had to take her handkerchief and wipe it
before she could see herself properly. Everything in the room was
equally dusty. As for the lace curtains, they looked as if they hadn't
been washed for years, and one of them had a long ragged hole in it. I
couldn't help feeling secretly surprised, for Aunt Jean had the
reputation of being a perfect housekeeper. However, I didn't say
anything, and neither did the other girls. Mother had always impressed
upon us that it was the height of bad manners to criticize anything we
might not like in a house where we were guests.

"Well, let's see about dinner," said Alberta, practically, snapping
her bracelet on her wrist and admiring the effect.

We went to the kitchen, where Elizabeth proceeded to light the fire,
that being one of her specialties, while Alberta and I explored the
pantry. We found the dinner supplies laid out as Aunt Jean had
explained. There was a nice fat turkey all stuffed, and vegetables
galore. The mince pies were in their place, but they were almost the
only things about which that could be truthfully said, for the
disorder of that pantry was enough to give a tidy person nightmares
for a month. "I never in all my life saw--" began Alberta, and then
stopped short, evidently remembering Mother's teaching.

"Where is the plum pudding?" said I, to turn the conversation into
safer channels.

It was nowhere to be seen, so we concluded it must be in the cellar.
But we found the cellar door padlocked good and fast.

"Never mind," said Elizabeth. "You know none of us really likes plum
pudding. We only eat it because it is the proper traditional dessert.
The mince pies will suit us better."

We hurried the turkey into the oven, and soon everything was going
merrily. We had lots of fun getting up that dinner, and we made
ourselves perfectly at home, as Aunt Jean had commanded. We kindled a
fire in the dining room and dusted everything in sight. We couldn't
find anything remotely resembling a duster, so we used our
handkerchiefs. When we got through, the room looked like something, for
the furnishings were really very handsome, but our handkerchiefs--well!

Then we set the table with all the nice dishes we could find. There
was only one long tablecloth in the sideboard drawer, and there were
three holes in it, but we covered them with dishes and put a little
potted palm in the middle for a centrepiece. At one o'clock dinner was
ready for us and we for it. Very nice that table looked, too, as we
sat down to it.

Just as Alberta was about to spear the turkey with a fork and begin
carving, that being one of _her_ specialties, the kitchen door opened
and somebody walked in. Before we could move, a big, handsome,
bewhiskered man in a fur coat appeared in the dining-room doorway.

I wasn't frightened. He seemed quite respectable, I thought, and I
supposed he was some intimate friend of Uncle Norman's. I rose
politely and said, "Good day."

You never saw such an expression of amazement as was on that poor
man's face. He looked from me to Alberta and from Alberta to Elizabeth
and from Elizabeth to me again as if he doubted the evidence of his
eyes.

"Mr. and Mrs. Norman Young are not at home," I explained, pitying him.
"They went to Streatham this morning because Mrs. Young's sister is
very ill."

"What does all this mean?" said the big man gruffly. "This isn't
Norman Young's house ... it is mine. I'm William Young. Who are you?
And what are you doing here?"

I fell back into my chair, speechless. My very first impulse was to
put up my hand and cover the gold watch. Alberta had dropped the
carving knife and was trying desperately to get the gold bracelet off
under the table. In a flash we had realized our mistake and its
awfulness. As for me, I felt positively frightened; Margaret Hannah's
warnings of old had left an ineffaceable impression.

Elizabeth rose to the occasion. Rising to the occasion is another of
Elizabeth's specialties. Besides, she was not hampered by the tingling
consciousness that she was wearing a gift that had not been intended
for her.

"We have made a mistake, I fear," she said, with a dignity which I
appreciated even in my panic, "and we are very sorry for it. We were
invited to spend Christmas with Mr. and Mrs. Norman Young. When we got
off the train we were given a letter from them stating that they were
summoned away but telling us to go to their house and make ourselves
at home. The stationmaster told us that this was the house, so we came
here. We have never been in Monkshead, so we did not know the
difference. Please pardon us."

I had got off the watch by this time and laid it on the table,
unobserved, as I thought. Alberta, not having the key of the
bracelet, had not been able to get it off, and she sat there crimson
with shame. As for Uncle William, there was positively a twinkle in
his eye. He did not look in the least ogreish.

"Well, it has been quite a fortunate mistake for me," he said. "I came
home expecting to find a cold house and a raw dinner, and I find this
instead. I'm very much obliged to you."

Alberta rose, went to the mantel piece, took the key of the bracelet
therefrom, and unlocked it. Then she faced Uncle William. "Mrs. Young
told us in her letter that we would find our Christmas gifts on the
table, so we took it for granted that these things belonged to us,"
she said desperately. "And now, if you will kindly tell us where Mr.
Norman Young does live, we won't intrude on you any longer. Come,
girls."

Elizabeth and I rose with a sigh. There was nothing else to be done,
of course, but we were fearfully hungry, and we did not feel
enthusiastic over the prospect of going to another empty house and
cooking another dinner.

"Wait a bit," said Uncle William. "I think since you have gone to all
the trouble of cooking the dinner it's only fair you should stay and
help to eat it. Accidents seem to be rather fashionable just now. My
housekeeper's son broke his leg down at Weston, and I had to take her
there early this morning. Come, introduce yourselves. To whom am I
indebted for this pleasant surprise?"

"We are Elizabeth, Alberta, and Mary Young of Green Village," I said;
and then I looked to see the ogre creep out if it were ever going to.

But Uncle William merely looked amazed for the first moment, foolish
for the second, and the third he was himself again.

"Robert's daughters?" he said, as if it were the most natural thing in
the world that Robert's daughters should be there in his house. "So
you are my nieces? Well, I'm very glad to make your acquaintance. Sit
down and we'll have dinner as soon as I can get my coat off. I want to
see if you are as good cooks as your mother used to be long ago."

We sat down, and so did Uncle William. Alberta had her chance to show
what she could do at carving, for Uncle William said it was something
he never did; he kept a housekeeper just for that. At first we felt a
bit stiff and awkward; but that soon wore off, for Uncle William was
genial, witty, and entertaining. Soon, to our surprise, we found that
we were enjoying ourselves. Uncle William seemed to be, too. When we
had finished he leaned back and looked at us.

"I suppose you've been brought up to abhor me and all my works?" he
said abruptly.

"Not by Father and Mother," I said frankly. "They never said anything
against you. Margaret Hannah did, though. She brought us up in the way
we should go through fear of you."

Uncle William laughed.

"Margaret Hannah was a faithful old enemy of mine," he said. "Well, I
acted like a fool--and worse. I've been sorry for it ever since. I was
in the wrong. I couldn't have said this to your father, but I don't
mind saying it to you, and you can tell him if you like."

"He'll be delighted to hear that you are no longer angry with him,"
said Alberta. "He has always longed to be friends with you again,
Uncle William. But he thought you were still bitter against him."

"No--no--nothing but stubborn pride," said Uncle William. "Now, girls,
since you are my guests I must try to give you a good time. We'll take
the double sleigh and have a jolly drive this afternoon. And about
those trinkets there--they are yours. I did get them for some young
friends of mine here, but I'll give them something else. I want you to
have these. That watch looked very nice on your blouse, Mary, and the
bracelet became Alberta's pretty wrist very well. Come and give your
cranky old uncle a hug for them."

Uncle William got his hugs heartily; then we washed up the dishes and
went for our drive. We got back just in time to catch the evening
train home. Uncle William saw us off at the station, under promise to
come back and stay a week with him when his housekeeper came home.

"One of you will have to come and stay with me altogether, pretty
soon," he said. "Tell your father he must be prepared to hand over one
of his girls to me as a token of his forgiveness. I'll be down to talk
it over with him shortly."

When we got home and told our story, Father said, "Thank God!" very
softly. There were tears in his eyes. He did not wait for Uncle
William to come down, but went to Monkshead himself the next day.

In the spring Alberta is to go and live with Uncle William. She is
making a supply of dusters now. And next Christmas we are going to
have a grand family reunion at the old homestead. Mistakes are not
always bad.


The Genesis of the Doughnut Club


When John Henry died there seemed to be nothing for me to do but pack
up and go back east. I didn't want to do it, but forty-five years of
sojourning in this world have taught me that a body has to do a good
many things she doesn't want to do, and that most of them turn out to
be for the best in the long run. But I knew perfectly well that it
wasn't best for me or anybody else that I should go back to live with
William and Susanna, and I couldn't think what Providence was about
when things seemed to point that way.

I wanted to stay in Carleton. I loved the big, straggling, bustling
little town that always reminded me of a lanky, overgrown schoolboy,
all arms and legs, but full to the brim with enthusiasm and splendid
ideas. I knew Carleton was bound to grow into a magnificent city, and
I wanted to be there and see it grow and watch it develop; and I loved
the whole big, breezy golden west, with the rush and tingle of its
young life. And, more than all, I loved my boys, and what I was going
to do without them or they without me was more than I knew, though I
tried to think Providence might know.

But there was no place in Carleton for me; the only thing to do was to
go back east, and I knew that all the time, even when I was
desperately praying that I might find a way to remain. There's not
much comfort, or help either, praying one way and believing another.

I'd lived down east in Northfield all my life--until five years
ago--lived with my brother William and his wife. Northfield was a
little pinched-up village where everybody knew more about you than you
did about yourself, and you couldn't turn around without being
commented upon. William and Susanna were kind to me, but I was just
the old maid sister, of no importance to anybody, and I never felt as
if I were really living. I was simply vegetating on, and wouldn't be
missed by a single soul if I died. It is a horrible feeling, but I
didn't expect it would ever be any different, and I had made up my
mind that when I died I would have the word "Wasted" carved on my
tombstone. It wouldn't be conventional at all, but I'd been
conventional all my life, and I was determined I'd have something done
out of the common even if I had to wait until I was dead to have it.

Then all at once the letter came from John Henry, my brother out west.
He wrote that his wife had died and he wanted me to go out and keep
house for him. I sat right down and wrote him I'd go and in a week's
time I started.

It made quite a commotion; I had that much satisfaction out of it to
begin with. Susanna wasn't any too well pleased. I was only the old
maid sister, but I was a good cook, and help was scarce in Northfield.
All the neighbours shook their heads, and warned me I wouldn't like
it. I was too old to change my ways, and I'd be dreadfully homesick,
and I'd find the west too rough and boisterous. I just smiled and said
nothing.

Well, I came out here to Carleton, and from the time I got here I was
perfectly happy. I did not know whether to leave or bring him home,
but vile Roncero of being alone and very arrimao to come and jícele
your taste, which was also ours, for he made here, may take more or
less back home, and better than nowhere is the venturao with us
wherever it is. What is aterecío it is cold, is not it, father? And
look, there will be good in the kitchen fire, is not it, Don Marcelo?
Usté depart and be more of these things that daunt Amurrio and, while
being well acompañao with entering and leaving ... step and, look,
which adds to why Tona good Ollon great that we are three more

¡Daughter who happen to be bobás when no one knows what diz, or take
the times as they come! So ¿entendióme, father ... And Usté, Don
Marcelo, what does this have paez mine, as if he were in my house?
Everything seemed fine, until the style, and Mari Pepa taking
precautions to avoid being sick of hearing and decision Lituca
of, and in particular, the face that put to declarármela. I drove
myself to the kitchen to Pedro Nolasco, who was left to bring and
carry harebrained as a child, and he sat on the couch of my uncle,
leaving care and Chisco Tona, who went there then, with custom you
entertained and encourage ... and it would soon ask to eat, if
requested.

I would return there very often, and the ladies would also occasionally.
In the meantime, lots of wood on hand and good light unabated. Before
leaving the kitchen, watched by cristalejos the door gives balconazo
of that facade, and saw the blackened continued celajes already bleached
and a little peaks across the meadows and up the valley somewhere.
When I arrived at my uncle's room and had taken him and his surrounding
Lituca and her mother, and sent to Facia their regular chores, not
to be needed there its presence by then. in ordering furniture,
clothes and bottles and bottles of potingues; designed rugs and
mats, which are abundant in the soil, graduated and went in light

fails completely in the face of the sick, and he cleaned up the
viscous cold sweat on his forehead relucía, and arranged the covers
and pillows, but this, like when working out, without making noise
or lifting dust or cause the slightest mortification to the patient.

I was happy to contemplate that job fairytale benefactors. My uncle,
stifled by coughing, sometimes waking up from their slumber,
opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on us hampered and voracious, and
then close them again to fall back on drowsiness. When taking
advantage of these situations to give a few sips of broth or 'tablespoon'
medicinal 'him' tomábalo between balbucía groans and angry protests.
Around noon cleared a bit much and we pondered how bad it was. Neluco
came here and tried to convince courtesy or otherwise. But he urged
them to take their work with patience, because it was not required
unless a man of his faith and his belt. To which the patient replied
with all iracundia he could find from their own pile of ruins: -
Do you thing paez na my patience, condenao?

With half of what I have I would like to see you, mediquín, matasanos
of demons, to see which side were ... Oh, man ... all intervened,
including Neluco for calm, and calmed down soon, but said the idea of
preparing to die well. On this point the doctor was very upset.
But I was determined to give my boys one good celebration before I
went, anyway. It was near Thanksgiving, and I resolved they should
have a dinner that would keep my memory green for awhile, a real
old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner such as they used to have at home. I
knew it would cost more than I could really afford, but I shut my eyes
to that aspect of the question. I was going back to strict eastern
economy for the rest of my days, and I meant to indulge in one wild,
blissful riot of extravagance before I was cooped up again.

I counted up the boys I must have, and there were fifteen, including
the minister. I invited them a fortnight ahead to make sure of getting
them, though I needn't have worried, for they all said they would have
broken an engagement to dine with the king for one of my dinners. The
minister said he had been feeling so homesick he was afraid he
wouldn't be able to preach a real thankful sermon, but now he was
comfortably sure that his sermon would be overflowing with gratitude.

I just threw myself heart and soul into the preparations for that
dinner. I had three turkeys and two sucking pigs, and mince pies and
pumpkin pies and apple pies, and doughnuts and fruit cake and
cranberry sauce and brown bread, and ever so many other things to fill
up the chinks. The night before Thanksgiving everything was ready, and
I was so tired I could hardly talk to Jimmy Nelson when he dropped in.

Jimmy had something on his mind, I saw that. So I said, "'Fess up,
Jimmy, and then you'll be able to enjoy your call."

"I want to ask a favour of you, Aunt Patty," said Jimmy.

I knew I should have to grant it; nobody could refuse Jimmy anything,
he looked so much like a nice, clean, pink-and-white little schoolboy
whose mother had just scrubbed his face and told him to be good. At
the same time he was one of the wildest young scamps in Carleton, or
had been until a year ago. I'd got him well set on the road to
reformation, and I felt worse about leaving him than any of the rest
of them. I knew he was just at the critical point. With somebody to
tide him over the next half year he'd probably go straight for the
rest of his life, but if he were left to himself he'd likely just slip
back to his old set and ways.

"I want you to let me bring my Uncle Joe to dinner tomorrow," said
Jimmy. "The poor old fellow is stranded here for Thanksgiving, and he
hates hotels. May I?"

"Of course," I said heartily, wondering why Jimmy seemed to think I
mightn't want his Uncle Joe. "Bring him right along."

"Thanks," said Jimmy. "He'll be more than pleased. Your sublime
cookery will delight him. He adores the west, but he can't endure its
cooking. He's always harping on his mother's pantry and the good old
down-east dinners. He's dyspeptic and pessimistic most of the time,
and he's got half a dozen cronies just like himself. All they think of
is railroads and bills of fare."

"Railroads!" I cried. And then an awful thought assailed me. "Jimmy
Nelson, your uncle isn't--isn't--he can't be Joseph P. Nelson, the
_rich_ Joseph P. Nelson!"

"Oh, he's rich enough," said Jimmy; getting up and reaching for his
hat. "In dollars, that is. Some ways he's poor enough. Well, I must be
going. Thanks ever so much for letting me bring Uncle Joe."

And that rascal was gone, leaving me crushed. Joseph Nelson was coming
to my house to dinner--Joseph P. Nelson, the millionaire railroad
king, who kept his own chef and was accustomed to dining with the
great ones of the earth!

I was afraid I should never be able to forgive Jimmy. I couldn't sleep
a wink that night, and I cooked that dinner next day in a terrible
state of mind. Every ring that came at the door made my heart
jump,--but in the end Jimmy didn't ring at all, but just walked in
with his uncle in tow. The minute I saw Joseph P. I knew I needn't be
scared of _him_; he just looked real common. He was little and thin
and kind of bored-looking, with grey hair and whiskers, and his
clothes were next door to downright shabbiness. If it hadn't been for
the thought of that chef, I wouldn't have felt a bit ashamed of my
old-fashioned Thanksgiving spread.

When Joseph P. sat down to that table he stopped looking bored. All
the time the minister was saying grace that man simply stared at a big
plate of doughnuts near my end of the table, as if he'd never seen
anything like them before.

All the boys talked and laughed while they were eating, but Joseph P.
just _ate_, tucking away turkey and vegetables and keeping an anxious
eye on those doughnuts, as if he was afraid somebody else would get
hold of them before his turn came. So get ready, the meat

You hobnob with everyone, even
that old man who comes around buying eggs. It is very bad form."

Pauline hid a rather undutiful smile behind her napkin. Aunt Olivia's
snobbish opinions always amused her.

"You've no idea what an interesting old man he is," she said. "He can
talk more entertainingly than any other man I know. What is the use of
being so exclusive, Aunt Olivia? You miss so much fun. You wouldn't be
so horribly bored as you are if you fraternized a little with the
'natives,' as you call them."

"No, thank you," said Mrs. Wallace disdainfully.

"Well, I am going to try to get acquainted with that girl," said
Pauline resolutely. "She looks nice and jolly."

"I don't know where you get your low tastes from," groaned Mrs.
Wallace. "I'm sure it wasn't from your poor mother. What do you
suppose the Morgan Knowles would think if they saw you taking up with
some tomboy girl on a farm?"

"I don't see why it should make a great deal of difference what they
would think, since they don't seem to be aware of my existence, or
even of yours, Aunty," said Pauline, with twinkling eyes. She knew it
was her aunt's dearest desire to get in with the Morgan Knowles'
"set"--a desire that seemed as far from being realized as ever. Mrs.
Wallace could never understand why the Morgan Knowles shut her from
their charmed circle. They certainly associated with people much
poorer and of more doubtful worldly station than hers--the Markhams,
for instance, who lived on an unfashionable street and wore quite
shabby clothes. Just before she had left Colchester, Mrs. Wallace had
seen Mrs. Knowles and Mrs. Markham together in the former's
automobile. James Wallace and Morgan Knowles were associated in
business dealings; but in spite of Mrs. Wallace's schemings and
aspirations and heart burnings, the association remained a purely
business one and never advanced an inch in the direction of
friendship.

As for Pauline, she was hopelessly devoid of social ambitions and she
did not in the least mind the Morgan Knowles' remote attitude.

"Besides," continued Pauline, "she isn't a tomboy at all. She looks
like a very womanly, well-bred sort of girl. Why should you think her
a tomboy because she drives cows? Cows are placid, useful
animals--witness this delicious cream which I am pouring over my
blueberries. And they have to be driven. It's an honest occupation."

"I daresay she is someone's servant," said Mrs. Wallace
contemptuously. "But I suppose even that wouldn't matter to you,
Pauline?"

"Not a mite," said Pauline cheerfully. "One of the very nicest girls I
ever knew was a maid Mother had the last year of her dear life. I
loved that girl, Aunt Olivia, and I correspond with her. She writes
letters that are ten times more clever and entertaining than those
stupid epistles Clarisse Gray sends me--and Clarisse Gray is a rich
man's daughter and is being educated in Paris."

"You are incorrigible, Pauline," said Mrs. Wallace hopelessly.

"Mrs. Boyd," said Pauline to their landlady, who now made her
appearance, "who is that girl who drives the cows along the beech lane
mornings and evenings?"

"Ada Cameron, I guess," was Mrs. Boyd's response. "She lives with the
Embrees down on the old Embree place just below here. They're
pasturing their cows on the upper farm this summer. Mrs. Embree is her
father's half-sister."

"Is she as nice as she looks?"

"Yes, Ada's a real nice sensible girl," said Mrs. Boyd. "There is no
nonsense about her."

"That doesn't sound very encouraging," murmured Pauline, as Mrs. Boyd
went out. "I like people with a little nonsense about them. But I hope
better things of Ada, Mrs. Boyd to the contrary notwithstanding. She
has a pair of grey eyes that can't possibly always look sensible. I
think they must mellow occasionally into fun and jollity and wholesome
nonsense. Well, I'm off to the shore. I want to get that photograph of
the Cove this evening, if possible. I've set my heart on taking first
prize at the Amateur Photographers' Exhibition this fall, and if I can
only get that Cove with all its beautiful lights and shadows, it will
be the gem of my collection."

Pauline, on her return from the shore, reached the beech lane just as
the Embree cows were swinging down it. Behind them came a tall,
brown-haired, brown-faced girl in a neat print dress. Her hat was hung
over her arm, and the low evening sunlight shone redly over her smooth
glossy head. She carried herself with a pretty dignity, but when her
eyes met Pauline's, she looked as if she would smile on the slightest
provocation.

Pauline promptly gave her the provocation.

"Good evening, Miss Cameron," she called blithely. "Won't you please
stop a few moments and look me over? I want to see if you think me a
likely person for a summer chum."

Ada Cameron did more than smile. She laughed outright and went over to
the fence where Pauline was sitting on a stump. She looked down into
the merry black eyes of the town girl she had been half envying for a
week and said humorously: "Yes, I think you very likely, indeed. But
it takes two to make a friendship--like a bargain. If I'm one, you'll
have to be the other."

"I'm the other. Shake," said Pauline, holding out her hand.

That was the beginning of a friendship that made poor Mrs. Wallace
groan outwardly as well as inwardly. Pauline and Ada found that they
liked each other even more than they had expected to. They walked,
rowed, berried and picnicked together. Ada did not go to Mrs. Boyd's a
great deal, for some instinct told her that Mrs. Wallace did not look
favourably on her, but Pauline spent half her time at the little,
brown, orchard-embowered house at the end of the beech lane where the
Embrees lived. She had never met any girl she thought so nice as Ada.

"She is nice every way," she told the unconvinced Aunt Olivia. "She's
clever and well read. She is sensible and frank. She has a sense of
humour and a great deal of insight into character--witness her liking
for your niece! She can talk interestingly and she can also be silent
when silence is becoming. And she has the finest profile I ever saw.
Aunt Olivia, may I ask her to visit me next winter?"

"No, indeed," said Mrs. Wallace, with crushing emphasis. "You surely
don't expect to continue this absurd intimacy past the summer,
Pauline?"

"I expect to be Ada's friend all my life," said Pauline laughingly,
but with a little ring of purpose in her voice. "Oh, Aunty, dear,
can't you see that Ada is just the same girl in cotton print that she
would be in silk attire? She is really far more distinguished looking
than any girl in the Knowles' set."

"Pauline!" said Aunt Olivia, looking as shocked as if Pauline had
committed blasphemy.

Pauline laughed again, but she sighed as she went to her room. Aunt
Olivia has the kindest heart in the world, she thought. What a pity
she isn't able to see things as they really are! My friendship with
Ada can't be perfect if I can't invite her to my home. And she is such
a dear girl--the first real friend after my own heart that I've ever
had.

The summer waned, and August burned itself out.

"I suppose you will be going back to town next week? I shall miss you
dreadfully," said Ada.

The two girls were in the Embree garden, where Pauline was preparing
to take a photograph of Ada standing among the asters, with a great
sheaf of them in her arms. Pauline wished she could have said: But you
must come and visit me in the winter. Since she could not, she had to
content herself with saying: "You won't miss me any more than I shall
miss you. But we'll correspond, and I hope Aunt Olivia will come to
Marwood again next summer."

"I don't think I shall be here then," said Ada with a sigh. "You see,
it is time I was doing something for myself, Pauline. Aunt Jane and
Uncle Robert have always been very kind to me, but they have a large
family and are not very well off. So I think I'll try for a situation
in one of the Remington stores this fall."

"It's such a pity you couldn't have gone to the Academy and studied
for a teacher's licence," said Pauline, who knew what Ada's ambitions
were.

"I should have liked that better, of course," said Ada quietly. "But
it is not possible, so I must do my best at the next best thing. Don't
let's talk of it. It might make me feel blueish and I want to look
especially pleasant if I'm going to have my photo taken."

"You couldn't look anything else," laughed Pauline. "Don't smile too
broadly--I want you to be looking over the asters with a bit of a
dream on your face and in your eyes. If the picture turns out as
beautiful as I fondly expect, I mean to put it in my exhibition
collection under the title 'A September Dream.' There, that's the very
expression. When you look like that, you remind me of somebody I have
seen, but I can't remember who it is. All ready now--don't
move--there, dearie, it is all over."

When Pauline went back to Colchester, she was busy for a month
preparing her photographs for the exhibition, while Aunt Olivia
renewed her spinning of all the little social webs in which she fondly
hoped to entangle the Morgan Knowles and other desirable flies.

When the exhibition was opened, Pauline Palmer's collection won first
prize, and the prettiest picture in it was one called "A September
Dream"--a tall girl with a wistful face, standing in an old-fashioned
garden with her arms full of asters.

The very day after the exhibition was opened the Morgan Knowles'
automobile stopped at the Wallace door. Mrs. Wallace was out, but it
was Pauline whom stately Mrs. Morgan Knowles asked for. Pauline was at
that moment buried in her darkroom developing photographs, and she ran
down just as she was--a fact which would have mortified Mrs. Wallace
exceedingly if she had ever known it. But Mrs. Morgan Knowles did not
seem to mind at all. She liked Pauline's simplicity of manner. It was
more than she had expected from the aunt's rather vulgar
affectations.

"I have called to ask you who the original of the photograph 'A
September Dream' in your exhibit was, Miss Palmer," she said
graciously. "The resemblance to a very dear childhood friend of mine
is so startling that I am sure it cannot be accidental."

"That is a photograph of Ada Cameron, a friend whom I met this summer
up in Marwood," said Pauline.

"Ada Cameron! She must be Ada Frame's daughter, then," exclaimed Mrs.
Knowles in excitement. Then, seeing Pauline's puzzled face, she
explained: "Years ago, when I was a child, I always spent my summers
on the farm of my uncle, John Frame. My cousin, Ada Frame, was the
dearest friend I ever had, but after we grew up we saw nothing of each
other, for I went with my parents to Europe for several years, and Ada
married a neighbour's son, Alec Cameron, and went out west. Her
father, who was my only living relative other than my parents, died,
and I never heard anything more of Ada until about eight years ago,
when somebody told me she was dead and had left no family. That part
of the report cannot have been true if this girl is her daughter."

"I believe she is," said Pauline quickly. "Ada was born out west and
lived there until she was eight years old, when her parents died and
she was sent east to her father's half-sister. And Ada looks like
you--she always reminded me of somebody I had seen, but I never could
decide who it was before. Oh, I hope it is true, for Ada is such a
sweet girl, Mrs. Knowles."

"She couldn't be anything else if she is Ada Frame's daughter," said
Mrs. Knowles. "My husband will investigate the matter at once, and if
this girl is Ada's child we shall hope to find a daughter in her, as
we have none of our own."

"What will Aunt Olivia say!" said Pauline with wickedly dancing eyes
when Mrs. Knowles had gone.

Aunt Olivia was too much overcome to say anything. That good lady felt
rather foolish when it was proved that the girl she had so despised
was Mrs. Morgan Knowles' cousin and was going to be adopted by her.
But to hear Aunt Olivia talk now, you would suppose that she and not
Pauline had discovered Ada.

The latter sought Pauline out as soon as she came to Colchester, and
the summer friendship proved a life-long one and was, for the
Wallaces, the open sesame to the enchanted ground of the Knowles'
"set."

"So everybody concerned is happy," said Pauline. "Ada is going to
college and so am I, and Aunt Olivia is on the same committee as Mrs.
Knowles for the big church bazaar. What about my 'low tastes' now,
Aunt Olivia?"

"Well, who would ever have supposed that a girl who drove cows to
pasture was connected with the Morgan Knowles?" said poor Aunt Olivia
piteously.


The Growing Up of Cornelia


                                              January First.

Aunt Jemima gave me this diary for a Christmas present. It's just the
sort of gift a person named Jemima would be likely to make.

I can't imagine why Aunt Jemima thought I should like a diary.
Probably she didn't think about it at all. I suppose it happened to be
the first thing she saw when she started out to do her Christmas duty
by me, and so she bought it. I'm sure I'm the last girl in the world
to keep a diary. I'm not a bit sentimental and I never have time for
soul outpourings. It's jollier to be out skating or snowshoeing or
just tramping around. And besides, nothing ever happens to me worth
writing in a diary.

Still, since Aunt Jemima gave it to me, I'm going to get the good out
of it. I don't believe in wasting even a diary. Father ... it would be
easier to write "Dad," but Dad sounds disrespectful in a diary ...
says I have a streak of old Grandmother Marshall's economical nature
in me. So I'm going to write in this book whenever I have anything
that might, by any stretch of imagination, be supposed worth while.

Jen and Alice and Sue would have plenty to write about, I dare say.
They certainly seem to have jolly times ... and as for the men ... but
there! People say men are interesting. They may be. But I shall never
get well enough acquainted with any of them to find out.

Mother says it is high time I gave up my tomboy ways and came "out"
too, because I am eighteen. I coaxed off this winter. It wasn't very
hard, because no mother with three older unmarried girls on her hands
would be very anxious to bring out a fourth. The girls took my part
and advised Mother to let me be a child as long as possible. Mother
yielded for this time, but said I must be brought out next winter or
people would talk. Oh, I hate the thought of it! People might talk
about my not being brought out, but they will talk far more about the
blunders I shall make.

The doleful fact is, I'm too wretchedly shy and awkward to live. It
fills my soul with terror to think of donning long dresses and putting
my hair up and going into society. I can't talk and men frighten me to
death. I fall over things as it is, and what will it be with long
dresses? As far back as I can remember it has been my one aim and
object in life to escape company. Oh, if only one need never grow up!
If I could only go back four years and stay there!

Mother laments over it muchly. She says she doesn't know what she has
done to have such a shy, unpresentable daughter. _I_ know. She married
Grandmother Marshall's son, and Grandmother Marshall was as shy as she
was economical. Mother triumphed over heredity with Jen and Sue and
Alice, but it came off best with me. The other girls are noted for
their grace and tact. But I'm the black sheep and always will be. It
wouldn't worry me so much if they'd leave me alone and stop nagging
me. "Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness," where there were no
men, no parties, no dinners ... just quantities of dogs and horses and
skating ponds and woods! I need never put on long dresses then, but
just be a jolly little girl forever.

However, I've got one beautiful year before me yet, and I mean to make
the most of it.

       *       *       *       *       *

                                              January Tenth.

It is rather good to have a diary to pour out your woes in when you
feel awfully bad and have no one to sympathize with you. I've been
used to shutting them all up in my soul and then they sometimes
fermented and made trouble.

We had a lot of people here to dinner tonight, and that made me
miserable to begin with. I had to dress up in a stiff white dress
_with a sash_, and Jen tied two big white fly-away bows on my hair
that kept rasping my neck and tickling my ears in a most exasperating
way. Then an old lady whom I detest tried to make me talk before
everybody, and all I could do was to turn as red as a beet and
stammer: "Yes, ma'am," "no, ma'am." It made Mother furious, because it
is so old-fashioned to say "ma'am." Our old nurse taught me to say it
when I was small, and though it has been pretty well governessed out
of me since then, it's sure to pop up when I get confused and nervous.

Sue ... may it be accounted unto her for righteousness ... contrived
that I should go out to dinner with old Mr. Grant, because she knew he
goes to dinners for the sake of eating and never talks or wants
anybody else to. But when we were crossing the hall I stepped on Mrs.
Burnett's train and something tore. Mrs. Burnett gave me a furious
look and glowered all through dinner. The meal was completely spoiled
for me and I could find no comfort, even in the Nesselrode pudding,
which is my favourite dessert.

It was just when the pudding came on that I got the most unkindest cut
of all. Mrs. Allardyce remarked that Sidney Elliot was coming home to
Stillwater.

Everybody exclaimed and questioned and seemed delighted. I saw Mother
give one quick, involuntary look at Jen, and then gaze steadfastly at
Mr. Grant to atone for it. Jen is twenty-six, and Stillwater is next
door to our place!

As for me, I was so vexed that I might as well have been eating chips
for all the good that Nesselrode pudding was to me. If Sidney Elliot
were coming home everything would be spoiled. There would be no more
ramblings in the Stillwater woods, no more delightful skating on the
Stillwater lake. Stillwater has been the only place in the world where
I could find the full joy of solitude, and now this, too, was to be
taken from me. We had no woods, no lake. I hated Sidney Elliot.

It is ten years since Sidney Elliot closed Stillwater and went abroad.
He has stayed abroad ever since and nobody has missed him, I'm sure. I
remember him dimly as a tall dark man who used to lounge about alone
in his garden and was always reading books. Sometimes he came into our
garden and teased us children. He is said to be a cynic and to detest
society. If this latter item be a fact I almost feel a grim pity for
him. He may detest it, but he will be dragged into it. Rich bachelors
are few and far between in Riverton, and the mammas will hunt him
down.

I feel like crying. If Sidney Elliot comes home I shall be debarred
from Stillwater. I have roamed its demesnes for ten beautiful years,
and I'm sure I love them a hundredfold better than he does, or can. It
is flagrantly unfair. Oh, I hate him!

       *       *       *       *       *

                                          January Twentieth.

No, I don't. I believe I like him. Yet it's almost unbelievable. I've
always thought men so detestable.

I'm tingling all over with the surprise and pleasure of a little
unexpected adventure. For the first time I have something really worth
writing in a diary ... and I'm glad I have a diary to write it in.
Blessings on Aunt Jemima! May her shadow never grow less.

This evening I started out for a last long lingering ramble in my
beloved Stillwater woods. The last, I thought, because I knew Sidney
Elliot was expected home next week, and after that I'd have to be
cooped up on our lawn. I dressed myself comfortably for climbing
fences and skimming over snowy wastes. That is, I put on the shortest
old tweed skirt I have and a red jacket with sleeves three years
behind the fashion, but jolly pockets to put your hands in, and a
still redder tam. Thus accoutred, I sallied forth.

It was such a lovely evening that I couldn't help enjoying myself in
spite of my sorrows. The sun was low and creamy, and the snow was so
white and the shadows so slender and blue. All through the lovely
Stillwater woods was a fine frosty stillness. It was splendid to skim
down those long wonderful avenues of crusted snow, with the mossy grey
boles on either hand, and overhead the lacing, leafless boughs, I
just drank in the air and the beauty until my very soul was thrilling,
and I went on and on and on until I was most delightfully lost. That
is, I didn't know just where I was, but the woods weren't so big but
that I'd be sure to come out safely somewhere; and, oh, it was so
glorious to be there all alone and never a creature to worry me.

At last I turned into a long aisle that seemed to lead right out into
the very heart of a deep-red overflowing winter sunset. At its end I
found a fence, and I climbed up on that fence and sat there, so
comfortably, with my back against a big beech and my feet dangling.

Then I saw him!

I knew it was Sidney Elliot in a moment. He was just as tall and just
as black-eyed; he was still given to lounging evidently, for he was
leaning against the fence a panel away from me and looking at me with
an amused smile. After my first mad impulse to rush away and bury
myself in the wilderness that smile put me at ease. If he had looked
grave or polite I would have been as miserably shy as I've always been
in a man's presence. But it was the smile of a grandfather for a
child, and I just grinned cheerfully back at him.

He ploughed along through the thick drift that was soft and spongy by
the fence and came close up to me.

"You must be little Cornelia," he said with another aged smile. "Or
rather, you _were_ little Cornelia. I suppose you are big Cornelia now
and want to be treated like a young lady?"

"Indeed, I don't," I protested. "I'm not grown up and I don't want to
be. You are Mr. Elliot, I suppose. Nobody expected you till next week.
What made you come so soon?"

"A whim of mine," he said. "I'm full of whims and crotchets. Old
bachelors always are. But why did you ask that question in a tone
which seemed to imply that you resented my coming so soon, Miss
Cornelia?"

"Oh, don't tack the Miss on," I implored. "Call me Cornelia ... or
better still, Nic, as Dad does. I _do_ resent your coming so soon. I
resent your coming at all. And, oh, it is such a satisfaction to tell
you so."

He smiled with his eyes ... a deep, black, velvety smile. But he shook
his head sorrowfully.

"I must be getting very old," he said. "It's a sign of age when a
person finds himself unwelcome and superfluous."

"Your age has nothing to do with it," I retorted. "It is because
Stillwater is the only place I have to run wild in ... and running
wild is all I'm fit for. It's so lovely and roomy I can lose myself in
it. I shall die or go mad if I'm cooped up on our little pocket
handkerchief of a lawn."

"But why should you be?" he inquired gravely.

I reflected ... and was surprised.

"After all, I don't know ... now ... why I should be," I admitted. "I
thought you wouldn't want me prowling about your domains. Besides, I
was afraid I'd meet you ... and I don't like meeting men. I hate to
have them around ... I'm so shy and awkward."

"Do you find me very dreadful?" he asked.

I reflected again ... and was again surprised.

"No, I don't. I don't mind you a bit ... any more than if you were
Dad."

"Then you mustn't consider yourself an exile from Stillwater. The
woods are yours to roam in at will, and if you want to roam them alone
you may, and if you'd like a companion once in a while command me.
Let's be good friends, little lass. Shake hands on it."

I slipped down from the fence and shook hands with him. I did like him
very much ... he was so nice and unaffected and brotherly ... just as
if I'd known him all my life. We walked down the long white avenue,
where everything was growing dusky, and I had told him all my troubles
before we got to the end of it. He was so sympathetic and agreed with
me that it was a pity people had to grow up. He promised to come over
tomorrow and look at Don's leg. Don is one of my dogs, and he has got
a bad leg. I've been doctoring it myself, but it doesn't get any
better. Sidney thinks he can cure it. He says I must call him Sidney
if I want him to call me Nic.

When we got to the lake, there it lay all gleaming and smooth as glass
... the most tempting thing.

"What a glorious possible slide," he said. "Let us have it, little
lass."

He took my hand and we ran down the slope and went skimming over the
ice. It _was_ glorious. The house came in sight as we reached the
other side. It was big and dark and silent.

"So the old place is still standing," said Sidney, looking up at it.
In the dusk I thought his face had a tender, reverent look instead of
the rather mocking expression it had worn all along.

"Haven't you been there yet?" I asked quickly.

"No. I'm stopping at the hotel over in Croyden. The house will need
some fixing up before it's fit to live in. I just came down tonight to
look at it and took a short cut through the woods. I'm glad I did. It
was worth while to see you come tramping down that long white avenue
when you thought yourself alone with the silence. I thought I had
never seen a child so full of the pure joy of existence. Hold fast to
that, little lass, as long as you can. You'll never find anything to
take its place after it goes. You jolly little child!"

"I'm eighteen," I said suddenly. I don't know what made me say it.

He laughed and pulled his coat collar up around his ears.

"Never," he mocked. "You're about twelve ... stay twelve, and always
wear red caps and jackets, you vivid thing: Good night."

He was off across the lake, and I came home. Yes, I do like him, even
if he is a man.

                                         February Twentieth.

I've found out what diaries are for ... to work off blue moods in,
moods that come on without any reason whatever and therefore can't be
confided to any fellow creature. You scribble away for a while ... and
then it's all gone ... and your soul feels clear as crystal once more.

I always go to Sidney now in a blue mood that has a real cause. He can
cheer me up in five minutes. But in such a one as this, which is quite
unaccountable, there's nothing for it but a diary.

Sidney has been living at Stillwater for a month. It seems as if he
must have lived there always.

He came to our place the next day after I met him in the woods.
Everybody made a fuss over him, but he shook them off with an ease I
envied and whisked me out to see Don's leg. He has fixed it up so that
it is as good as new now, and the dogs like him almost better than
they like me.

We have had splendid times since then. We are just the jolliest chums
and we tramp about everywhere together and go skating and snowshoeing
and riding. We read a lot of books together too, and Sidney always
explains everything I don't understand. I'm not a bit shy and I can
always find plenty to say to him. He isn't at all like any other man I
know.

Everybody likes him, but the women seem to be a little afraid of him.
They say he is so terribly cynical and satirical. He goes into society
a good bit, although he says it bores him. He says he only goes
because it would bore him worse to stay home alone.

There's only one thing about Sidney that I hardly like. I think he
rather overdoes it in the matter of treating me as if I were a little
girl. Of course, I don't want him to look upon me as grown up. But
there is a medium in all things, and he really needn't talk as if he
thought I was a child of ten and had no earthly interest in anything
but sports and dogs. These _are_ the best things ... I suppose ... but
I understand lots of other things too, only I can't convince Sidney
that I do. I know he is laughing at me when I try to show him I'm not
so childish as he thinks me. He's indulgent and whimsical, just as he
would be with a little girl who was making believe to be grown up.
Perhaps next winter, when I put on long dresses and come out, he'll
stop regarding me as a child. But next winter is so horribly far off.

The day we were fussing with Don's leg I told Sidney that Mother said
I'd have to be grown up next winter and how I hated it, and I made him
promise that when the time came he would use all his influence to beg
me off for another year. He said he would, because it was a shame to
worry children about society. But somehow I've concluded not to bother
making a fuss. I have to come out some time, and I might as well take
the plunge and get it over.

Mrs. Burnett was here this evening fixing up some arrangements for a
charity bazaar she and Jen are interested in, and she talked most of
the time about Sidney ... for Jen's benefit, I suppose, although Jen
and Sid don't get on at all. They fight every time they meet, so I
don't see why Mrs. Burnett should think things.

"I wonder what he'll do when Mrs. Rennie comes to the Glasgows' next
month," said Mrs. Burnett.

"Why should he do anything?" asked Jen.

"Oh, well, you know there was something between them ... an
understanding if not an engagement ... before she married Rennie. They
met abroad ... my sister told me all about it ... and Mr. Elliot was
quite infatuated with her. She was a very handsome and fascinating
girl. Then she threw him over and married old Jacob Rennie ... for his
millions, of course, for he certainly had nothing else to recommend
him. Reinoldo. But that would indeed honor its sacred night Seyn.
Polonius. That is not where you Ausdrüken in a little vorsehet: You
must not go so far as to accuse him and that he was a public
whore-hunter sey, that is not my Meynung, so you must talk of its
mistakes, that they mistake for the freedom, a fiery outbursts

Reinoldo. But why, Gracious Lord, - Polonius.

Why should her thun? Reinoldo. Yes, Gracious Lord, like 'I ask. Polonius.
Good Lord, I will tell you it is a trick, sir, and, Beyme element, I
think one of the fine. You see, if you like my son beyleget small
mistake that you can think it sey a young lad, a little in doing

following masses against you will be let out: "Werther" My Lord!

or simply Mr., or my friend, or as he likes to say - Reinoldo. Very well,
Mr. Gracious - Polonius. And then, Lord, does he - does he - what I
want to say - because I wanted what to say - where was I? Reinoldo. the
Bey, as he is against me would be let out - Polonius.

As it turned out he would - yes, my Six - he would be let out - I know
the young Lord, I saw him yesterday or the day before yesterday, or
a different day and with the, and, like you say, as he played because
he gerieth in Hize because he fieng Beyme ball game to Handel, or
maybe I saw him in disagreement or that suspicious house, videlicet
in a brothel, or the like - You see now that in this way the Angel

so that you now my son Bey applicieren you can - you have understood
me, did you not?

Reinoldo . Yes, Gracious Lord. Polonius.

       So God forbid you, lives well.

                                                Reinoldo.

My Gracious Lord - Polonius. You must seek that ye yourselves behind
by his inclinations come. Reinoldo. I will, Gracious Lord. Polonius .
And makes his music that he diligently exerciert. Reinoldo. well,
Gracious Lord. (Reinold's up.) Zweyte Scene. (Ophelia occurs.) Polonius.
Farewell - Ha, what giebts, Ophelia? What do you want? Ophelia. Oh,
Gracious Lord Father, I am so erschrekt been! Polonius. What, what,
about heaven's sake? Ophelia. Mr. Gracious Father, because I am in my
room, sat and sewed, as was the Prince Hamlet, his dewlap from top
to bottom to ungeknöpft, no hat on his head, his stockings are not
raised without knee ligaments, to the toes rolled down, so pale as
his shirt, shivering, his knees anschlugen to each other, and with
a so Blik pathetic significance, as if he were out of hell would
have been left out, so he should talk about their Schreknissen; in
this form, he is out before me.

Polonius.

He is not out of love for you has been great Seyn? Ophelia. I know
it not, Mr. Gracious Father, but, on my honor, I'll get it. Polonius.
What he said then?

Ophelia.

Bey He gave me his hand, and held me, then he makes the entire length
of his arm back, and the other hand he held it over his forehead, and
then he looked me sharply in the face, as if he wanted to sign off.
So he stuhnd a good while, as last, he shook my arm a bit, wavered
dreymal so with his head up and down, and then to seek such a deep
and pathetic sigh, not that I thought differently than he would
give up the spirit.

Top he let me go, turned his head on the shoulder, and seemed
Rükweg without his eyes to find, because he came without their
Hülfe to Thür out, and tacked it as last even with a sad Blik on me.

Polonius. Come with me I want the king advice. This is nothing different
than the effect of excessive and non-self-placed love, because the
violence of love is so fierce that the people so desperate acts can
drive, than any other passion, what our nature is tainted.

I am sorry for this, did you recently about his hard-tempered? Ophelia.
No, Mr.

Gracious Father, everything that I was just that I command euerm
no letters from him believing him and not let me come.

Polonius . And he had been foolish. I am sorry that I am the nature
of his affection to you better not have watched. I worried that he
now only briefly, and entice you to search, but the executioner get
my hasty concerns, it seems sey a feature of age, the wariness too
far to drive, as Bey young people is nothing in common as to no have.
Come, we want to go to the king. He must get message of which the
My discoveries in this mystery we can not as much draw annoyances
than we could have them if we would remain silent.

(They go from.) Third Scene. (Transforms into the palace.) (The King,

think (or my head would have all the trouble that I have in my
life on the political soothsayers Art colleagues, have been in

O, as talking about the things I am most requested to be heard.

He says to me, my dearest queen, he was the true source of our

I procure, it is in fact no other than his father's death and our hasty
marriage. Fourth Scene. (Polonius comes with Cornelius Voltimand
and back.)

King. Well, we want him to have worms move from the nose - Welcome,
my good friends!

Talking Voltimand what brings it to us by our brother Norway? Voltimand.
The coercive Erwiederung Grusse with all your friendship Erbietungen.
On our first ad schikte he said the ads off of his nephew, which

Come and rest from IZT, on the night we want to laugh with each

(The messengers go from.) Polonius.

This business is now glüklich geendigt. My area of Merciful Lord,
and my madam; widely to expose what majesty and what duty is, why
the day is day, night night, and time is time, if nothing else as
day, night time and spoil.

Accordingly alldieweilen and then the shortness of the soul Wizes,

son is great, great, I call it, because to the true madness to give
a definition of what is different, as nothing else than to Seyn toll?

But we want IZO beyseite Sezen - Queen. More substance with less
art, if you would arbitrarily. Polonius.

       Madam, I can swear on it that I do not dißmal prior art purposes.

                                                That it toll, is true, that it is true, is to regret - a funny
character - but she likes to travel, because here I will use no art.

So we want to reason that he is great, now it is left that we are
the cause of this effect, or more properly speaking, the cause of this
defect after them. The remains, and this residue is DISS - Überleget

I have a daughter, had, tell me, as long as it is my, and this has made
guiltier duty and obedience, want to note, sent me this now rathet
once, or make you a Seyn what it likes.

(He opens a letter and reads:) "To the heavenly idol of my soul that
reizerfüllteste Ophelia" - This is a terrible phrase, a abgeschmakte
saying Reizerfüllteste is a abgeschmakte way to talk: But it's yet
to be heard - "These lines of its incomparable white bosom, these

If the Hamlet of them? Polonius. madam, just a little patience, I
want my guilt thun. (He reads:) doubt the fire Hize, doubters in the
sun light, doubt whether the truth lies, fairest, thy victory only to
my love And not. O, my dear Ophelia, I am angry about these verses,
I understand the art is not my sighs to fingers abzuzählen, but that
I love you so completely when you're worthy of love, believe. Adieu.
The deinige so long as this machine is to Hamlet. " This has given
me so my daughter from pflichtschuldigem obedience shows, and even
further überdas my ears with all his pursuits of, as by time, place
and circumstances come to pass have made known.

King. But, as has his love of them? Polonius. What denket her from
me? King. That ye an honest and full of dutiful husband Seyde. Polonius.
So I would like to exist in the sample. But what could you think? As
I was aware of fiery love, (you and I must confess that I have noticed,
eh what my daughter told them,) what would Eu. Royal Majesties can
think? If I have a desk or writing table presented, or from the
intentions weitaussehenden pigeons and made dumb, or this love with
indifferent eyes hingesehen had, what would you think?

But no, I went through just fine, and discussed my young wenches following

fruits of my Raths have been.

After that I make it short, as he was refused, so he gerieht in sadness,
then lost his appetite, to sleep, he lapsed into a weakness, from this
into a delirium, and so by degrees to degrees, finally the madness,
worinn he now raset, and what we all Mourning. king.

Think you mean? queen. It can even want Seyn possible. Polonius.
If ever a time been the möcht 'but I like to know where I have
said positive , it is so, and it has been found otherwise?

King. To my knowledge not. Polonius. If it is different, I have lost
my head. If I know only a few circumstances, I will always find where
the truth lies verstekt, and if it is in the center of the earth
stekte. King. But how could we be certain of the matter?

Polonius. You know, that he sometimes four hours behind each other here
in the gallery on and off. Queen. It is so. Polonius. For such a time,
I want my daughter to leave him: You and I want us behind a versteken
wallpaper, and because we want to observe what steps will be: He
loves them not, and has not lost sense, I will post my ministers
to abandon, a farmer and manure on my fields lead. king.

We want to explore the matter further. Fifth Scene. (Hamlet, in a beech
reading occurs.) Queen. Look, here comes the poor drip therefore, in a
book to read - it looks like schwermüthig! Polonius. I ask you,
you beyde removed. I want him to address.

(The King and Queen go from.) O, with permits - What is my Gracious
Prince Hamlet - Hamlet. Well, thank God sey.

Polonius. Do you know me, Gracious Lord? Hamlet. Very want, their
Seyde a fish dealer.

Polonius. That I am not, Gracious Lord. Hamlet. So do I, as you
would an honest man Polonius. Honestly, Gracious Lord? Hamlet. Yes,
Lord, sincere Seyn, that is, as today's world, as much as tens of
thousands Seyn excluded.

Polonius. The aim is true, Gracious Lord. Hamlet. For if the sun Todt

Let them not go in the sun; Empfängniß is a blessing, but how could

What do you want to say - (in front of you.)

Always the same Leyer from my daughter, and yet he knew me not at first,
he gave me a fish dealer. It is far came with him, but I want erinnre
me that I in my youth erschreklich lot of love ausgestanden did,
it was pretty close to this - I want to address it again. What
you read, Gracious Lord? Hamlet. Words, words, words. Polonius. What
is the speech, Gracious Lord? Hamlet. Between whom? Polonius. I Meyn,
what the content of what you read, sey? Hamlet. Calumnien, Lord,
because of the satirical because Jack says that old men have gray
beards, and runzlichte faces, their eyes dripped amber and plum-tree
resin, and they had a lack of good sense with a very weak hams.

Which all, sir, although I believe powerful and consolidate, but

Polonius (in front of him.) If the madness is, as it is, there is
method indoors - Have ye not a little out of the air Freyer, Gracious
Lord? Hamlet. In my grave. Polonius.

That in the Freyer would be from the air - (front). nachdrüklich how

Güldenstern. In the dungeon, Gracious Lord? Hamlet. Dännemark is a

the worst. Rosary. We do not think so, Gracious Lord. Hamlet.
Not? Now it is not so well for you: There is nothing as good or as
bad, not by our Meynung this is done: For me it is a prison.
Rosary. If it is, so make it your ambition to it is too narrow for

O God, I wanted to lock up in a nutshell, and I imagine that I am king
over an infinite space sey, if I only not so terrible dreams would
have. Güldenstern. What Dreams basically nothing else than ambition
are, because what is the whole essence of Ehrsüchtigen as a shadow of
a dream? Hamlet. A dream is just a shadow of itself. rosary. However,
I think the ambition for something as light and insubstantial that
it only shadow of a shadow genennt to be earned. Hamlet. According to
this way of urtheilen are our beggars, bodies, and our monarchs

Are we going after the court? Because, on my honor, raisonnieren is not

To what end, Gracious Lord? Hamlet. That ye shall ausforschen me,

It has let us Ruffer, Gracious Lord. Hamlet. I will tell you what,

I have since some time, why do not I know, all my cheerfulness lost all
my usual exercises abandoned, and the That is my Schwermuth so far
that these anmuthige earth to me only a bare Vorgebürge; this
magnificent canopy the air, you see, this proud about hanging

What a Meisterstük is the man! How noble the reason! How infinite in
its capabilities!

On shape and motion strength as completed and admirable!

In Würker how similar to an angel! In thinking how like a god! The
most beautiful adornment of Creation! The most perfect of all
visible beings!

And yet, what is in my eyes this quintessence of dust? Man I do not

"You are the very person I was just going in search of. I've news to
tell. Sit down."

He spoke eagerly, patting the big gray boulder beside him with his
slim, brown hand. For a moment Beatrice hesitated. She wanted to be
alone just then. But his clever, homely face was so appealing that she
yielded and sat down.

Stephen flung himself down again contentedly in the grasses at her
feet, pillowing his chin in his palms and looking up at her,
adoringly.

"You are so beautiful, dear lady. I love to look at you. Will you tilt
that hat a little more over the left eye-brow? Yes--so--some day I
shall paint you."

His tone and manner were all simplicity.

"When you are a great artist," said Beatrice, indulgently.

He nodded.

"Yes, I mean to be that. I've told you all my dreams, you know. Now
for my news. I'm going away to-morrow. I had a telegram from father
to-day."

He drew the message from his pocket and flourished it up at her.

"I'm to join him in Europe at once. He is in Rome. Think of it--in
Rome! I'm to go on with my art studies there. And I leave to-morrow."

"I'm glad--and I'm sorry--and you know which is which," said Beatrice,
patting the shaggy brown head. "I shall miss you dreadfully, Stephen."

"We _have_ been splendid chums, haven't we?" he said, eagerly.

Suddenly his face changed. He crept nearer to her, and bowed his head
until his lips almost touched the hem of her dress.

"I'm glad you came down to-day," he went on in a low, diffident voice.
"I want to tell you something, and I can tell it better here. I
couldn't go away without thanking you. I'll make a mess of it--I can
never explain things. But you've been so much to me--you mean so much
to me. You've made me believe in things I never believed in before.
You--you--I know now that there is such a thing as a good woman, a
woman who could make a man better, just because he breathed the same
air with her."

He paused for a moment; then went on in a still lower tone:

"It's hard when a fellow can't speak of his mother because he can't
say anything good of her, isn't it? My mother wasn't a good woman.
When I was eight years old she went away with a scoundrel. It broke
father's heart. Nobody thought I understood, I was such a little
fellow. But I did. I heard them talking. I knew she had brought shame
and disgrace on herself and us. And I had loved her so! Then, somehow,
as I grew up, it was my misfortune that all the women I had to do with
were mean and base. They were hirelings, and I hated and feared them.
There was an aunt of mine--she tried to be good to me in her way. But
she told me a lie, and I never cared for her after I found it out. And
then, father--we loved each other and were good chums. But he didn't
believe in much either. He was bitter, you know. He said all women
were alike. I grew up with that notion. I didn't care much for
anything--nothing seemed worth while. Then I came here and met you."

He paused again. Beatrice had listened with a gray look on her face.
It would have startled him had he glanced up, but he did not, and
after a moment's silence the halting boyish voice went on:

"You have changed everything for me. I was nothing but a clod before.
You are not the mother of my body, but you are of my soul. It was
born of you. I shall always love and reverence you for it. You will
always be my ideal. If I ever do anything worth while it will be
because of you. In everything I shall ever attempt I shall try to do
it as if you were to pass judgment upon it. You will be a lifelong
inspiration to me. Oh, I am bungling this! I can't tell you what I
feel--you are so pure, so good, so noble! I shall reverence all women
for your sake henceforth."

"And if," said Beatrice, in a very low voice, "if I were false to your
ideal of me--if I were to do anything that would destroy your faith in
me--something weak or wicked--"

"But you couldn't," he interrupted, flinging up his head and looking
at her with his great dog-like eyes, "you couldn't!"

"But if I could?" she persisted, gently, "and if I did--what then?"

"I should hate you," he said, passionately. "You would be worse than a
murderess. You would kill every good impulse and belief in me. I would
never trust anything or anybody again--but there," he added, his voice
once more growing tender, "you will never fail me, I feel sure of
that."

"Thank you," said Beatrice, almost in a whisper. "Thank you," she
repeated, after a moment. She stood up and held out her hand. "I think
I must go now. Good-bye, dear laddie. Write to me from Rome. I shall
always be glad to hear from you wherever you are. And--and--I shall
always try to live up to your ideal of me, Stephen."

He sprang to his feet and took her hand, lifting it to his lips with
boyish reverence. "I know that," he said, slowly. "Good-bye, my sweet
lady."

When Mrs. Longworth found herself in her room again, she unlocked her
desk and took out a letter. It was addressed to Mr. Maurice
Cunningham. She slowly tore it twice across, laid the fragments on a
tray, and touched them with a lighted match. As they blazed up one
line came out in writhing redness across the page: "I will go away
with you as you ask." Then it crumbled into gray ashes.

She drew a long breath and hid her face in her hands.


The Promissory Note


Ernest Duncan swung himself off the platform of David White's store
and walked whistling up the street. Life seemed good to Ernest just
then. Mr. White had given him a rise in salary that day, and had told
him that he was satisfied with him. Mr. White was not easy to please
in the matter of clerks, and it had been with fear and trembling that
Ernest had gone into his store six months before. He had thought
himself fortunate to secure such a chance. His father had died the
preceding year, leaving nothing in the way of worldly goods except the
house he had lived in. For several years before his death he had been
unable to do much work, and the finances of the little family had
dwindled steadily. After his father's death Ernest, who had been going
to school and expecting to go to college, found that he must go to
work at once instead to support himself and his mother.

If George Duncan had not left much of worldly wealth behind him, he at
least bequeathed to his son the interest of a fine, upright character
and a reputation for honesty and integrity. None knew this better than
David White, and it was on this account that he took Ernest as his
clerk, over the heads of several other applicants who seemed to have a
stronger "pull."

"I don't know anything about _you_, Ernest," he said bluntly. "You're
only sixteen, and you may not have an ounce of real grit or worth in
you. But it will be a queer thing if your father's son hasn't. I knew
him all his life. A better man never lived nor, before his accident, a
smarter one. I'll give his son a chance, anyhow. If you take after
your dad you'll get on all right."

Ernest had not been in the store very long before Mr. White concluded,
with a gratified chuckle, that he did take after his father. He was
hard-working, conscientious, and obliging. Customers of all sorts,
from the rough fishermen who came up from the harbour to the old
Irishwomen from the back country roads, liked him. Mr. White was
satisfied. He was beginning to grow old. This lad had the makings of a
good partner in him by and by. No hurry; he must serves long
apprenticeship first and prove his mettle; no use spoiling him by
hinting at future partnerships before need was. That would all come in
due time. David White was a shrewd man.

Ernest was unconscious of his employer's plans regarding him; but he
knew that he stood well with him and, much to his surprise, he found
that he liked the work, and was beginning to take a personal interest
and pleasure in the store. Hence, he went home to tea on this
particular afternoon with buoyant step and smiling eyes. It was a good
world, and he was glad to be alive in it, glad to have work to do and
a dear little mother to work for. Most of the folks who met him smiled
in friendly fashion at the bright-eyed, frank-faced lad. Only old
Jacob Patterson scowled grimly as he passed him, emitting merely a
surly grunt in response to Ernest's greeting. But then, old Jacob
Patterson was noted as much for his surliness as for his miserliness.
Nobody had ever heard him speak pleasantly to anyone; therefore his
unfriendliness did not at all dash Ernest's high spirits.

"I'm sorry for him," the lad thought. "He has no interest in life save
accumulating money. He has no other pleasure or affection or ambition.
When he dies I don't suppose a single regret will follow him. Father
died a poor man, but what love and respect went with him to his
grave--aye, and beyond it. Jacob Patterson, I'm sorry for you. You
have chosen the poorer part, and you are a poor man in spite of your
thousands."

Ernest and his mother lived up on the hill, at the end of the
straggling village street. The house was a small, old-fashioned one,
painted white, set in the middle of a small but beautiful lawn. George
Duncan, during the last rather helpless years of his life, had devoted
himself to the cultivation of flowers, shrubs, and trees and, as a
result, his lawn was the prettiest in Conway. Ernest worked hard in
his spare moments to keep it looking as well as in his father's
lifetime, for he loved his little home dearly, and was proud of its
beauty.

He ran gaily into the sitting-room.

"Tea ready, lady mother? I'm hungry as a wolf. Good news gives one an
appetite. Mr. White has raised my salary a couple of dollars per week.
We must celebrate the event somehow this evening. What do you say to a
sail on the river and an ice cream at Taylor's afterwards? When a
little woman can't outlive her schoolgirl hankering for ice
cream--why, Mother, what's the matter? Mother, dear!"

Mrs. Duncan had been standing before the window with her back to the
room when Ernest entered. When she turned he saw that she had been
crying.

"Oh, Ernest," she said brokenly, "Jacob Patterson has just been
here--and he says--he says--"

"What has that old miser been saying to trouble you?" demanded Ernest
angrily, taking her hands in his.

"He says he holds your father's promissory note for nine hundred
dollars, overdue for several years," answered Mrs. Duncan. "Yes--and
he showed me the note, Ernest."

"Father's promissory note for nine hundred!" exclaimed Ernest in
bewilderment. "But Father paid that note to James Patterson five years
ago, Mother--just before his accident. Didn't you tell me he did?"

"Yes, he did," said Mrs. Duncan, "but--"

"Then where is it?" interrupted Ernest. "Father would keep the
receipted note, of course. We must look among his papers."

"You won't find it there, Ernest. We--we don't know where the note is.
It--it was lost."

"Lost! That is unfortunate. But you say that Jacob Patterson showed
you a promissory note of Father's still in existence? How can that be?
It can't possibly be the note he paid. And there couldn't have been
another note we knew nothing of?"

"I understand how this note came to be in Jacob Patterson's
possession," said Mrs. Duncan more firmly, "but he laughed in my face
when I told him. I must tell you the whole story, Ernest. But sit down
and get your tea first."

"I haven't any appetite for tea now, Mother," said Ernest soberly.
"Let me hear the whole truth about the matter."

"Seven years ago your father gave his note to old James Patterson,
Jacob's brother," said Mrs. Duncan. "It was for nine hundred dollars.
Two years afterwards the note fell due and he paid James Patterson the
full amount with interest. I remember the day well. I have only too
good reason to. He went up to the Patterson place in the afternoon
with the money. It was a very hot day. James Patterson receipted the
note and gave it to your father. Your father always remembered that
much; he was also sure that he had the note with him when he left the
house. He then went over to see Paul Sinclair. A thunderstorm came up
while he was on the road. Then, as you know, Ernest, just as he turned
in at Paul Sinclair's gate the lightning flash struck and stunned him.
It was weeks before he came to himself at all. He never did come
completely to himself again. When, weeks afterwards, I thought of the
note and asked him about it, we could not find it; and, search as we
did, we never found it. Your father could never remember what he did
with it when he left James Patterson's. Neither Mr. Sinclair nor his
wife could recollect seeing anything of it at the time of the
accident. James Patterson had left for California the very morning
after, and he never came back. We did not worry much about the loss of
the note then; it did not seem of much moment, and your father was not
in a condition to be troubled about the matter."

"But, Mother, this note that Jacob Patterson holds--I don't understand
about this."

"I'm coming to that. I remember distinctly that on the evening when
your father came home after signing the note he said that James
Patterson drew up a note and he signed it, but just as he did so the
old man's pet cat, which was sitting on the table, upset an ink bottle
and the ink ran all over the table and stained one end of the note.
Old James Patterson was the fussiest man who ever lived, and a
stickler for neatness. 'Tut, tut,' he said, 'this won't do. Here, I'll
draw up another note and tear this blotted one up.' He did so and your
father signed it. He always supposed James Patterson destroyed the
first one, and certainly he must have intended to, for there never was
an honester man. But he must have neglected to do so for, Ernest, it
was that blotted note Jacob Patterson showed me today. He said he
found it among his brother's papers. I suppose it has been in the desk
up at the Patterson place ever since James went to California. He died
last winter and Jacob is his sole heir. Ernest, that note with the
compound interest on it for seven years amounts to over eleven hundred
dollars. How can we pay it?"

"I'm afraid that this is a very serious business, Mother," said
Ernest, rising and pacing the floor with agitated strides. "We shall
have to pay the note if we cannot find the other--and even if we
could, perhaps. Your story of the drawing up of the second note would
not be worth anything as evidence in a court of law--and we have
nothing to hope from Jacob Patterson's clemency. No doubt he believes
that he really holds Father's unpaid note. He is not a dishonest man;
in fact, he rather prides himself on having made all his money
honestly. He will exact every penny of the debt. The first thing to do
is to have another thorough search for the lost note--although I am
afraid that it is a forlorn hope."

A forlorn hope it proved to be. The note did not turn up. Old Jacob
Patterson proved obdurate. He laughed to scorn the tale of the blotted
note and, indeed, Ernest sadly admitted to himself that it was not a
story anybody would be in a hurry to believe.

"There's nothing for it but to sell our house and pay the debt,
Mother," he said at last. Ernest had grown old in the days that had
followed Jacob Patterson's demand. His boyish face was pale and
haggard. "Jacob Patterson will take the case into the law courts if we
don't settle at once. Mr. White offered to lend me the money on a
mortgage on the place, but I could never pay the interest out of my
salary when we have nothing else to live on. I would only get further
and further behind. I'm not afraid of hard work, but I dare not borrow
money with so little prospect of ever being able to repay it. We must
sell the place and rent that little four-roomed cottage of Mr. Percy's
down by the river to live in. Oh, Mother, it half kills me to think of
your being turned out of your home like this!"

It was a bitter thing for Mrs. Duncan also, but for Ernest's sake she
concealed her feelings and affected cheerfulness. The house and lot
were sold, Mr. White being the purchaser thereof; and Ernest and his
mother removed to the little riverside cottage with such of their
household belongings as had not also to be sold to make up the
required sum. Even then, Ernest had to borrow two hundred dollars from
Mr. White, and he foresaw that the repayal of this sum would cost him
much self-denial and privation. It would be necessary to cut their
modest expenses down severely. For himself Ernest did not mind, but it
hurt him keenly that his mother should lack the little luxuries and
comforts to which she had been accustomed. He saw too, in spite of her
efforts to hide it, that leaving her old home was a terrible blow to
her. Altogether, Ernest felt bitter and disheartened; his step lacked
spring and his face its smile. He did his work with dogged
faithfulness, but he no longer found pleasure in it. He knew that his
mother secretly pined after her lost home where she had gone as a
bride, and the knowledge rendered him very unhappy.

       *       *       *       *       *

Paul Sinclair, his father's friend and cousin, died that winter,
leaving two small children. His wife had died the previous year. When
his business affairs came to be settled they were found to be sadly
involved. There were debts on all sides, and it was soon only too
evident that nothing was left for the little boys. They were homeless
and penniless.

"What will become of them, poor little fellows?" said Mrs. Duncan
pityingly. "We are their only relatives, Ernest. We must give them a
home at least."

"Mother, how can we!" exclaimed Ernest. "We are so poor. It's as much
as we can do to get along now, and there is that two hundred to pay
Mr. White. I'm sorry for Danny and Frank, but I don't see how we can
possibly do anything for them."

Mrs. Duncan sighed.

"I know it isn't right to ask you to add to your burden," she said
wistfully.

"It is of _you_ I am thinking, Mother," said Ernest tenderly. "I can't
have your burden added to. You deny yourself too much and work too
hard now. What would it be if you took the care of those children upon
yourself?"

"Don't think of me, Ernest," said Mrs. Duncan eagerly. "I wouldn't
mind. I'd be glad to do anything I could for them, poor little souls.
Their father was your father's best friend, and I feel as if it were
our duty to do all we can for them. They're such little fellows. Who
knows how they would be treated if they were taken by strangers? And
they'd most likely be separated, and that would be a shame. But I
leave it for you to decide, Ernest. It is your right, for the heaviest
part will fall on you."

Ernest did not decide at once. For a week he thought the matter over,
weighing pros and cons carefully. To take the two Sinclair boys meant
a double portion of toil and self-denial. Had he not enough to bear
now? But, on the other side, was it not his duty, nay, his privilege,
to help the children if he could? In the end he said to his mother:

"We'll take the little fellows, Mother. I'll do the best I can for
them. We'll manage a corner and a crust for them."

So Danny and Frank Sinclair came to the little cottage. Frank was
eight and Danny six, and they were small and lively and mischievous.
They worshipped Mrs. Duncan, and thought Ernest the finest fellow in
the world. When his birthday came around in March, the two little
chaps put their heads together in a grave consultation as to what they
could give him.

"You know he gave us presents on our birthdays," said Frank. "So we
must give him something."

"I'll div him my pottet-knife," said Danny, taking the somewhat
battered and loose-jointed affair from his pocket, and gazing at it
affectionately.

"I'll give him one of Papa's books," said Frank. "That pretty one with
the red covers and the gold letters."

A few of Mr. Sinclair's books had been saved for the boys, and were
stored in a little box in their room. The book Frank referred to was
an old _History of the Turks_, and its gay cover was probably the best
of it, since its contents were of no particular merit.

On Ernest's birthday both boys gave him their offerings after
breakfast.

"Here's a pottet-knife for you," said Danny graciously. "It's a bully
pottet-knife. It'll cut real well if you hold it dust the wight way.
I'll show you."

"And here's a book for you," said Frank. "It's a real pretty book, and
I guess it's pretty interesting reading too. It's all about the
Turks."

Then said the tenants with deep honesty of his voice: "Come to me
tomorrow night, folks, then you should certainly get your money -
one way or another."

And in firm tone he added: "And now back to your work. "" Well, then
we also thank very much, Sir. Adjüs! "" Good morning. "We heard
how the day laborers away, and, somewhat later, Hedwig noticed that the
heavy kicks Hohlweg herabknirschten. Now he had come. Involuntarily
met the girl behind the thorn-bush, when she wanted to the oncoming
undisturbed vorüberlassen. Also, the tenants had no idea of the
proximity of a strange nature that made him and his agony could
investigate, otherwise he would surely soon be vorübergeschritten
so but he at the lowest point of the path, it lowered his head on
her breast and pressed with a tired, flaccid move the hand against
the forehead.

There was so much fatigue is sealed so much pain. However, no groaning
quoll on the closed lips, silently, without word remained the great
shape, it was a mourning that is with himself and with God alone
abmacht, hidden and protected by the loneliness.

No third eye may espy the like. With its cool, sharp eyes had Wilms'
sister recorded it all, now she saw how the tenants the gray
Forstjoppe Strammer moved, the inspector zurechtrückte cap and solid
step continued.

Thank God. It was even better this way. Soon he had disappeared. And
yet - they forced their skill suddenly, almost against their will
into the fate of the man involved.

Already, he had the higher-lying level. A stone broke the embankment
, where the girl stood, and rolled in with banging Hohlweg down. Wilms
turned back abruptly. mistaken because he does not? The young, elegantly
dressed woman was really down there - yes it was Hedwig, she had surprised
him earlier.

The features of the lessee is distorted, somewhat increased brutality
in them, and the veins in his eyes were bloody. "How are you
there? "" I? "- they schlenkerte neglectfully the screen and came
closer -" I went a little walk. "" Why did you not at Else? "" Because
I no longer endured - the guards I think I was very strained. "Wilms
roared:" And now here you go so - so - what are you doing here
actually?

"He had been prevented, his lips quivered. But the girl was
suddenly something awakened something before it even dawned, and the
earlier they had thought so much. All close they came to the agitated
man approached him and threw a single glance, "I said yes, I am
going to walk," was showed sharp and defiantly. your fists into
the soft kid leather ballten itself, her body jerked.

At the moment it was like a cat, which is preparing to jump. From her
sparkling eyes which shone like with pestering her to wrestle. Breast
to breast. To anything Unrecognized - Precious - by himself all was
the raw, good-natured farmer so new, so incomprehensible that he is
in anger trembling creature before him for minutes kopfschüttelnd
anstarrte. "What you really want from me?"

Muttered he finally uncomprehendingly. "I?" You woke up suddenly
as if from a pleasant dream and a burning redness chased on their
trains. Both stared still, as all the heavens have fallen on.
Slowly let the girl down the slide screen collected and directed
taut. A contemptuous train flew to her fresh lips.

It was probably their fate, with men everywhere in the real, physical
battle to fight.

This because it seemed at least not dangerous. "I wanted to look
at you talk about your relationships," she began to brief and
bitter.

He was so big and strong, and yet so clumsy in front of her. Oh, how
it attracted such unruly giant their power to feel. "About my
relationships?" repeated the tenant, a cold sweat came to him on the
forehead. "As you have therefore consulted with before everything,
really everything?" "Yes, I know that you find embarrassment in money
.

«One second it took the embarrassing silence, the chest of a man
raised and lowered, when she wanted something to pass, he pushed
the head bull-like, which mechanically gritted teeth over each other.

Then it fell out of it." And thou - - what have you given purely to
mix, you cheeky Dirn? - - - What's it all about you at all?

No, no, you must continue - out of the house - today. "Screamed and
yelled to the girls really all this abuse in the face? No, oh no, dull
and painful words stung him only through the brain, on the lips
halbgeöffneten but quoll muffled and hoarse, "What does thee this? -
What does this all mean? What you push yourself in my affairs? What?
"" Why? - Because I am clear about the man wants to give, where
I now live. "" Do - do you really stay with us? - Hedwig - but - but
you - you do not even fit here, you suck in so much sadness - you
should prefer to walk again. "Involuntarily, both the way of new
and next steps on the empty heath . The man in the Unken together, the
girl erect slender and supple, from time to time a glance at the
tested companion heftend.

And again he said to himself, forcefully: "Yes, yes, you should go."
Then his arm seized Hedwig and put her own into it. It was the movement
and the manner how they over there in the aristocratic dance lesson in
the old Hansa city had learned. Stirnrunzelnd Wilms let it happen,
but inwardly enraged him so elegant behavior, although it is easy and
graceful enough exception. "brother, you have something against me?"
she asked suddenly, and left their wise brown eyes fixed upon him
rest. My arm still pressed against his, so they had to memorize his
fright. The honest man gave the lie, which is now used to be in total
confusion. "I - no, - what do you think - I have nothing against you."
"And Else?"

"My poor wife probably nothing - just - "He paused, and on its trains
spread open again the great embarrassment." But - well, then? ""
Well, you're probably only us too much about "- he stammered.

"Thou hast enjoyed training so much - over there in the fine hotel -
Else and I are just ordinary people. And then my small income,
you have even heard it, but you will in the long run do not like.

"It clings to him until he almost feel their soft limbs could and
whispered rapidly and with an expression of participation," But I
would so like to regain my strength for you to use, I am strong,
brother, and I want you want to help. "" Really?

"he went on and turned fully to her. "That wilt thou, in fact?" She
nodded and looked at him seriously. "And again a little peace and
quiet when you distribute. The missing but you? "The tenant said
nothing, but he sighed deeply and looked to be swept into the Waldessaum,
which they now zustrebten. Hedwig is fixed but depended on him and drove
interest continues:" Previously, you were but even certain more
cheerful? "" Yes, sooner "- repeated the country man, fetching a
deep breath -" before - as well as mag's been.

At that time we were still good things. Because I often went with Else
on the field - - "" What now? "She threw rapidly intervening.

Wilms allowed a shy glance over them and continued sliding his arm caused
by her clumsy. "Yes, my child, so nearly," he pressed. And after a
pause, he added almost disparagingly, "You see it does not really
like that."

No, "confirmed his companion. It sounded crisp and tart. Wordless beat
the two side by side the forest.

It was a weitgedehntes pine trees, with ausgehauenen regular routes,
like the straight narrow road cut through the forest at dusk,
and seemed to lose.

The tops of the trees were dipped in bright sunlight and weighs
in the faint draft back and forth. A strong smell of resin entquoll
the tribes. From far away we heard the monotonous sound of the ax
precipitated. And shouted loud and strong a jay in the air. The two
each other, as strangers were already far into the lonely, sleeping
forest intruded as Hedwig unexpectedly began the conversation anew.
The figure was placed on the dark brows were drawn together, her
entire being seemed to a fixed resolve to be masters.

"Where are you going now?" Researched it briefly. And it is precisely
this tone of the country could not tolerate man. Querulous shook his
head and seemed to have heard nothing. She was suddenly stand. He
turned and waved back unwillingly, but they are not touched by the
body.

In the tight jacket, the stylish hat and her face blooming among them,
took them strangely out between the tall, ancient pines. "Wherever
you go, I want to know?" And oddly, her glance was so firmly and
seriously to his, they were again so close to that, the man was
embarrassed. "To Förster, "he said after, and involuntarily muttered
he added:" I will sell him hay. "" You probably need the money for
the day laborers from before. Not true? "How they advised. As practically
the girl thought it was the suffering man neatly well that they have
rights. "Yes, yes," he took out full of fear, "if he only wants to buy."
To the fresh, slightly raised lips of a girl glided a haughty train.
"He will know," they replied, "He has a wife?"

"Yes, young married." "Well, then I will respond and the woman
looking to define." Ah yes, Hedwig, that would be - very nice - you -
"he stuttered with downcast eyes beaten.

A hot feeling rose in him, something like gratitude, something like the
desire to adapter to a system that he wanted to help. And yet
- big drops of sweat drips shame him on the forehead. You noticed it
and asked him to her the way to show it. Without opposition,
he had it happen that they are under his arm presented, and then
hurried away with her tempestuous forward with unusual haste. Their
clothes fluttered in the process through their cheeks ebbte the blood,
he looked at her and noticed how her breasts are accelerated raised
their breath streamed preclude him fresh.

Oh, it was perhaps the faithful helper, he looked, the sister of
his poor, beloved wife who wanted to bring him solace. FamilySafe How
fresh and meaningful it was. "Hedwig, you asked earlier - - - "" Under
your conditions, yes. "" I - I - Hedwig - if I only trust - - "And
then was the desire to communicate, overpowering. He forgot who
she was, he grabbed her hand, like that of another man, stammering
and faltering words, but with the deep soul of this soul sealed revealed
he is, he is relieved from the heavy pressure on, he poured all
his woe before the beautiful girl. And verily, it was beautiful.
While he spoke, raised her form, her limbs seemed to stretch, to be
abundant, and while it is informed by the rent arrears told, eight
of the period, which he man in the trade Grimmen left by his
complete breakdown, it was as if they are greedy lust with all those
hardships on their shoulders would order it now and unbowed alone
to bear.

As Wilms had ended, he saw them and was shocked. Her eyes were
on his. In the fire of his story, he had pressed them to itself, as
if he wanted to embrace them.

Horrified, awakening, he went back. "There - there is a
forester," he stammered. VII re-burned the large state-wide lamp in
the living room the lessee. And it was really already has become
comfortable.

An ice-cold rain had set out, and while one else in this transition
period, the cold and spent his time schauernd, crackled now a funny
fire in the great oven, and had from time to time, the soothing
sound of the bursting and crackling wood blocks hear.

Hedwig, laughing about the limitations, what with the heating
calendar will only begin when the first snow falls, even had the
old tile, the first Patriarch abundant food fed, and now the patient
was sitting in a huge armchair with blankets wrapped up before, and
warmed up and waited for the return of husband and sister, who
shared the pastor of the large village had migrated to the clergyman
and his family to visit the house to fetch the lessee.

Also, the forester and his wife wanted herüberkommen. Hedwig had insisted
at all costs because they thought, people and socializing in homes
abandoned due to this.

This was the end of suffering and often held hands before the fire jerking
up her blood through the skin through of saw. A warmth flowed through
it . Nearly would they feel comfortable. - If they do not just
leave it alone and would have remained. Why had the two go
together? Hedwig alone but would also suffice. Wilms But she had quite
the weather does not want to leave unaccompanied break - "it is not
chic," he said, and now they were already over an hour to continue.

       Beat the clock.

The patient became increasingly impatient. Maids and servants do
not care about them. For a long time for the first time was in the
house worked quickly, the tenants had Hedwigs help set up a dairy. Today
was the necessary machinery from Stralsund arrived, what a friend of
the girl on credit supply, and the servants, she is currently maintained.
Else could clear the laughter and chatter of the people hear. Not
even a ring on her hand with which they perhaps may have been
ringing. Quite leave - without any outside help. She began to frighten.
Wilms could really his long back. That was inconsiderate of him, and
named her the Verzärtelten, something quite unusual. Quietly, she began
to moan and moved to the chair back and forth - then held her hand

door.

Rapidly and energetically, and before the surprised woman could still
reflect, met a young man in a jacket and breeches in the parlor
and took her on the threshold of a brief gracious bow.

    impatiently on the door directed by the expected the next
    moment had to happen.

"I get today for the first visit, Mr. Graf - since - since a long
time." "Ah, the pleasure in your interest really quite extraordinary,"
said the rider and gradually slow to the window without looking
at the long sigh of the sick slightest consideration to take. "So

thought to himself yet, "Strange how my heart beats. - But I have

over the sick Trostesworte to those which he in his frequent visits
with the same words, repeated almost mechanically.

he could not explain his presence, and Wilms stood out with his guest
in the window corner, shook his hand and uneasy entangled him in all
sorts of agricultural issues, but without internal frightened by

So passed the first few minutes of the gathering. Until the ill

girl with hereintreten see, but then had it removed immediately.
"Perhaps assigns them in the kitchen or something," apologized Wilms.
But again he had to on the young fallow joke see the restlessly

"So?

She resented Louisa's laughter. She was sure
there was nothing so very ridiculous about her appearance. Women far
older than she, even in Latimer, wore light dresses and fashionable
hats. Really, Louisa was very disagreeable.

"I have put up with her ways too long," thought Mary Isabel, with a
quick, unwonted rush of anger. "But I never shall again--no, never,
let her be as vexed and scornful as she pleases."

The induction services were interesting, and Mary Isabel enjoyed them.
Doctor Hamilton was sitting across from her and once or twice she
caught him looking at her admiringly. The doctor noticed the hat and
the grey silk and wondered how Mary Isabel had managed to get her own
way concerning them. What a pretty woman she was! Really, he had never
realized before how very pretty she was. But then, he had never seen
her except in a sunbonnet or with her hair combed primly back.

But when the service was over Mary Isabel was dismayed to see that the
sky had clouded over and looked very much like rain. Everybody hurried
home, and Mary Isabel tripped along the shore road filled with
anxious thoughts about her dress. That kind of silk always spotted,
and her hat would be ruined if it got wet. How foolish she had been
not to bring an umbrella!

She reached her own doorstep panting just as the first drop of rain
fell.

"Thank goodness," she breathed.

Then she tried to open the door. It would not open.

She could see Louisa sitting by the kitchen window, calmly reading.

"Louisa, open the door quick," she called impatiently.

Louisa never moved a muscle, although Mary Isabel knew she must have
heard.

"Louisa, do you hear what I say?" she cried, reaching over and tapping
on the pane imperiously. "Open the door at once. It is going to
rain--it is raining now. Be quick."

Louisa might as well have been a graven image for all the response she
gave. Then did Mary Isabel realize her position. Louisa had locked her
out purposely, knowing the rain was coming. Louisa had no intention of
letting her in; she meant to keep her out until the dress and hat of
her rebellion were spoiled. This was Louisa's revenge.

Mary Isabel turned with a gasp. What should she do? The padlocked
doors of hen-house and well-house and wood-house: revealed the
thoroughness of Louisa's vindictive design. Where should she go? She
would go somewhere. She would not have her lovely new dress and hat
spoiled!

She caught her ruffled skirts up in her hand and ran across the yard.
She climbed the fence into the field and ran across that. Another drop
of rain struck her cheek. She never glanced back or she would have
seen a horrified face peering from the cottage kitchen window. Louisa
had never dreamed that Mary Isabel would seek refuge over at Dr.
Hamilton's.

Dr. Hamilton, who had driven home from church with the young minister,
saw her coming and ran to open the door for her. Mary Isabel dashed
up the verandah steps, breathless, crimson-cheeked, trembling with
pent-up indignation and sense of outrage.

"Louisa locked me out, Dr. Hamilton," she cried almost hysterically.
"She locked me out on purpose to spoil my dress. I'll never forgive
her, I'll never go back to her, never, never, unless she asks me to. I
had to come here. I was not going to have my dress ruined to please
Louisa."

"Of course not--of course not," said Dr. Hamilton soothingly, drawing
her into his big cosy living room. "You did perfectly right to come
here, and you are just in time. There is the rain now in good
earnest."

Mary Isabel sank into a chair and looked at Dr. Hamilton with tears in
her eyes.

"Wasn't it an unkind, unsisterly thing to do?" she asked piteously.
"Oh, I shall never feel the same towards Louisa again. Tom was
right--I didn't tell you about Tom's letter but I will by and by. I
shall not go back to Louisa after her locking me out. When it stops
raining I'll go straight up to my cousin Ella's and stay with her
until I arrange my plans. But one thing is certain, I shall not go
back to Louisa."

"I wouldn't," said the doctor recklessly. "Now, don't cry and don't
worry. Take off your hat--you can go to the spare room across the
hall, if you like. Jim has gone upstairs to lie down; he has a bad
headache and says he doesn't want any tea. So I was going to get up a
bachelor's snack for myself. My housekeeper is away. She heard, at
church that her mother was ill and went over to Marwood."

When Mary Isabel came back from the spare room, a little calmer but
with traces of tears on her pink cheeks, the doctor had as good a
tea-table spread as any woman could have had. Mary Isabel thought it
was fortunate that the little errand boy, Tommy Brewster, was there,
or she certainly would have been dreadfully embarrassed, now that the
flame of her anger had blown out. But later on, when tea was over and
she and the doctor were left alone, she did not feel embarrassed
after all. Instead, she felt delightfully happy and at home. Dr.
Hamilton put one so at ease.

She told him all about Tom's letter and her subsequent revolt. Dr.
Hamilton never once made the mistake of smiling. He listened and
approved and sympathized.

"So I'm determined I won't go back," concluded Mary Isabel, "unless
she asks me to--and Louisa will never do that. Ella will be glad
enough to have me for a while; she has five children and can't get any
help."

The doctor shrugged his shoulders. He thought of Mary Isabel as
unofficial drudge to Ella Kemble and her family. Then he looked at the
little silvery figure by the window.

"I think I can suggest a better plan," he said gently and tenderly.
"Suppose you stay here--as my wife. I've always wanted to ask you that
but I feared it was no use because I knew Louisa would oppose it and I
did not think you would consent if she did not. I think," the doctor
leaned forward and took Mary Isabel's fluttering hand in his, "I think
we can be very happy here, dear."

Mary Isabel flushed crimson and her heart beat wildly. She knew now
that she loved Dr. Hamilton--and Tom would have liked it--yes, Tom
would. She remembered how Tom hated the thought of his sisters being
old maids.

"I--think--so--too," she faltered shyly.

"Then," said the doctor briskly, "what is the matter with our being
married right here and now?"

"Married!"

"Yes, of course. Here we are in a state where no licence is required,
a minister in the house, and you all dressed in the most beautiful
wedding silk imaginable. You must see, if you just look at it calmly,
how much better it will be than going up to Mrs. Kemble's and thereby
publishing your difference with Louisa to all the village. I'll give
you fifteen minutes to get used to the idea and then I'll call Jim
down."

Mary Isabel put her hands to her face.

"You--you're like a whirlwind," she gasped. "You take away my breath."

"Think it over," said the doctor in a businesslike voice.

Mary Isabel thought--thought very hard for a few moments.

What would Tom have said?

Was it probable that Tom would have approved of such marrying in
haste?

Mary Isabel came to the decision that he would have preferred it to
having family jars bruited abroad. Moreover, Mary Isabel had never
liked Ella Kemble very much. Going to her was only one degree better
than going back to Louisa.

At last Mary Isabel took her hands down from her face. "Well?" said
the doctor persuasively as she did so.

"I will consent on one condition," said Mary Isabel firmly. "And that
is, that you will let me send word over to Louisa that I am going to
be married and that she may come and see the ceremony if she will.
Louisa has behaved very unkindly in this matter, but after all she is
my sister--and she has been good to me in some ways--and I am not
going to give her a chance to say that I got married in this--this
headlong-fashion and never let her know."

"Tommy can take the word over," said the doctor.

Mary Isabel went to the doctor's desk and wrote a very brief note.

    Dear Louisa:

    I am going to be married to Dr. Hamilton right away. I've seen
    him often at the shore this summer. I would like you to be
    present at the ceremony if you choose.

                                                Mary Isabel.


Tommy ran across the field with the note.

It had now ceased raining and the clouds were breaking. Mary Isabel
thought that a good omen. She and the doctor watched Tommy from the
window. They saw Louisa come to the door, take the note, and shut the
door in Tommy's face. Ten minutes later she reappeared, habited in her
mackintosh, with her second-best bonnet on.

"She's--coming," said Mary Isabel, trembling.

The doctor put his arm protectingly about the little lady.

Mary Isabel tossed her head. "Oh, I'm not--I'm only excited. I shall
never be afraid of Louisa again."

Louisa came grimly over the field, up the verandah steps, and into the
room without knocking.

"Mary Isabel," she said, glaring at her sister and ignoring the doctor
entirely, "did you mean what you said in that letter?"

"Yes, I did," said Mary Isabel firmly.

"You are going to be married to that man in this shameless, indecent
haste?"

"Yes."

"And nothing I can say will have the least effect on you?"

"Not the slightest."

"Then," said Louisa, more grimly than ever, "all I ask of you is to
come home and be married from under your father's roof. Do have that
much respect for your parents' memory, at least."

"Of course I will," cried Mary Isabel impulsively, softening at once.
"Of course we will--won't we?" she asked, turning prettily to the
doctor.

"Just as you say," he answered gallantly.

Louisa snorted. "I'll go home and air the parlour," she said. "It's
lucky I baked that fruitcake Monday. You can come when you're ready."

She stalked home across the field. In a few minutes the doctor and
Mary Isabel followed, and behind them came the young minister,
carrying his blue book under his arm, and trying hard and not
altogether successfully to look grave.


The Twins and a Wedding


Sometimes Johnny and I wonder what would really have happened if we
had never started for Cousin Pamelia's wedding. I think that Ted would
have come back some time; but Johnny says he doesn't believe he ever
would, and Johnny ought to know, because Johnny's a boy. Anyhow, he
couldn't have come back for four years. However, we _did_ start for
the wedding and so things came out all right, and Ted said we were a
pair of twin special Providences.

Johnny and I fully expected to go to Cousin Pamelia's wedding because
we had always been such chums with her. And she did write to Mother to
be sure and bring us, but Father and Mother didn't want to be bothered
with us. That is the plain truth of the matter. They are good parents,
as parents go in this world; I don't think we could have picked out
much better, all things considered; but Johnny and I have always known
that they never want to take us with them anywhere if they can get out
of it. Uncle Fred says that it is no wonder, since we are a pair of
holy terrors for getting into mischief and keeping everybody in hot
water. But I think we are pretty good, considering all the temptations
we have to be otherwise. And, of course, twins have just twice as many
as ordinary children.

Anyway, Father and Mother said we would have to stay home with Hannah
Jane. This decision came upon us, as Johnny says, like a bolt from the
blue. At first we couldn't believe they were not joking. Why, we felt
that we simply _had_ to go to Pamelia's wedding. We had never been to
a wedding in our lives and we were just aching to see what it would be
like. Besides, we had written a marriage ode to Pamelia and we wanted
to present it to her. Johnny was to recite it, and he had been
practising it out behind the carriage house for a week. I wrote the
most of it. I can write poetry as slick as anything. Johnny helped me
hunt out the rhymes. That is the hardest thing about writing poetry,
it is so difficult to find rhymes. Johnny would find me a rhyme and
then I would write a line to suit it, and we got on swimmingly.

When we realized that Father and Mother meant what they said we were
just too miserable to live. When I went to bed that night I simply
pulled the clothes over my face and howled quietly. I couldn't help it
when I thought of Pamelia's white silk dress and tulle veil and flower
girls and all the rest. Johnny said it was the wedding dinner _he_
thought about. Boys are like that, you know.

Father and Mother went away on the early morning train, telling us to
be good twins and not bother Hannah Jane. It would have been more to
the point if they had told Hannah Jane not to bother us. She worries
more about our bringing up than Mother does.

I was sitting on the front doorstep after they had gone when Johnny
came around the corner, looking so mysterious and determined that I
knew he had thought of something splendid.

"Sue," said Johnny impressively, "if you have any real sporting blood
in you now is the time to show it. If you've enough grit we'll get to
Pamelia's wedding after all."

"How?" I said as soon as I was able to say anything.

"We'll just go. We'll take the ten o'clock train. It will get to
Marsden by eleven-thirty and that'll be in plenty of time. The wedding
isn't until twelve."

"But we've never been on the train alone, and we've never been to
Marsden at all!" I gasped.

"Oh, of course, if you're going to hatch up all sorts of
difficulties!" said Johnny scornfully. "I thought you had more spunk!"

"Oh, I have, Johnny," I said eagerly. "I'm _all_ spunk. And I'll do
anything you'll do. But won't Father and Mother be perfectly savage?"

"Of course. But we'll be there and they can't send us home again, so
we'll see the wedding. We'll be punished afterwards all right, but
we'll have had the fun, don't you see?"

I saw. I went right upstairs to dress, trusting everything blindly to
Johnny. I put on my best pale blue shirred silk hat and my blue
organdie dress and my high-heeled slippers. Johnny whistled when he
saw me, but he never said a word; there are times when Johnny is a
duck.

We slipped away when Hannah Jane was feeding the hens.

"I'll buy the tickets," explained Johnny. "I've got enough money left
out of my last month's allowance because I didn't waste it all on
candy as you did. You'll have to pay me back when you get your next
month's jink, remember. I'll ask the conductor to tell us when we get
to Marsden. Uncle Fred's house isn't far from the station, and we'll
be sure to know it by all the cherry trees round it."

It sounded easy, and it _was_ easy. We had a jolly ride, and finally
the conductor came along and said, "Here's your jumping-off place,
kiddies."

Johnny didn't like being called a kiddy, but I saw the conductor's eye
resting admiringly on my blue silk hat and I forgave him.

Marsden was a pretty little village, and away up the road we saw Uncle
Fred's place, for it was fairly smothered in cherry trees all white
with lovely bloom. We started for it as fast as we could go, for we
knew we had no time to lose. It is perfectly dreadful trying to hurry
when you have on high-heeled shoes, but I said nothing and just tore
along, for I knew Johnny would have no sympathy for me. We finally
reached the house and turned in at the open gate of the lawn. I
thought everything looked very peaceful and quiet for a wedding to be
under way and I had a sickening idea that it was too late and it was
all over.

"Nonsense!" said Johnny, cross as a bear, because he was really
afraid of it too. "I suppose everybody is inside the house. No, there
are two people over there by that bench. Let us go and ask them if
this is the right place, because if it isn't we have no time to lose."

We ran across the lawn to the two people. One of them was a young
lady, the very prettiest young lady I had ever seen. She was tall and
stately, just like the heroine in a book, and she had lovely curly
brown hair and big blue eyes and the most dazzling complexion. But she
looked very cross and disdainful and I knew the minute I saw her that
she had been quarrelling with the young man. He was standing in front
of her and he was as handsome as a prince. But he looked angry too.
Altogether, you never saw a crosser-looking couple. Just as we came up
we heard the young lady say, "What you ask is ridiculous and
impossible, Ted. I _can't_ get married at two days' notice and I don't
mean to be."

And he said, "Very well, Una, I am sorry you think so. You would not
think so if you really cared anything for me. It is just as well I
have found out you don't. I am going away in two days' time and I
shall not return in a hurry, Una."

"I do not care if you never return," she said.

That was a fib and well I knew it. But the young man didn't--men are
so stupid at times. He swung around on one foot without replying and
he would have gone in another second if he had not nearly fallen over
Johnny and me.

"Please, sir," said Johnny respectfully, but hurriedly. "We're looking
for Mr. Frederick Murray's place. Is this it?"

"No," said the young man a little gruffly. "This is Mrs. Franklin's
place. Frederick Murray lives at Marsden, ten miles away."

My heart gave a jump and then stopped beating. I know it did, although
Johnny says it is impossible.

"Isn't this Marsden?" cried Johnny chokily.

"No, this is Harrowsdeane," said the young man, a little more mildly.

I couldn't help it. I was tired and warm and so disappointed. I sat
right down on the rustic seat behind me and burst into tears, as the
story-books say.

"Oh, don't cry, dearie," said the young lady in a very different voice
from the one she had used before. She sat down beside me and put her
arms around me. "We'll take you over to Marsden if you've got off at
the wrong station."

"But it will be too late," I sobbed wildly. "The wedding is to be at
twelve--and it's nearly that now--and oh, Johnny, I do think you might
try to comfort me!"

For Johnny had stuck his hands in his pockets and turned his back
squarely on me. I thought it so unkind of him. I didn't know then that
it was because he was afraid he was going to cry right there before
everybody, and I felt deserted by all the world.

"Tell me all about it," said the young lady.

So I told her as well as I could all about the wedding and how wild we
were to see it and why we were running away to it.

"And now it's all no use," I wailed. "And we'll be punished when they
find out just the same. I wouldn't mind being punished if we hadn't
missed the wedding. We've never seen a wedding--and Pamelia was to
wear a white silk dress--and have flower girls--and oh, my heart is
just broken. I shall never get over this--never--if I live to be as
old as Methuselah."

"What can we do for them?" said the young lady, looking up at the
young man and smiling a little. She seemed to have forgotten that they
had just quarrelled. "I can't bear to see children disappointed. I
remember my own childhood too well."

"I really don't know what we can do," said the young man, smiling
back, "unless we get married right here and now for their sakes. If it
is a wedding they want to see and nothing else will do them, that is
the only idea I can suggest."

"Nonsense!" said the young lady. But she said it as if she would
rather like to be persuaded it wasn't nonsense.

I looked up at her. "Oh, if you have any notion of being married I
wish you would right off," I said eagerly. "Any wedding would do just
as well as Pamelia's. Please do."

The young lady laughed.

"One might just as well be married at two hours' notice as two days',"
she said.

"Una," said the young man, bending towards her, "will you marry me
here and now? Don't send me away alone to the other side of the world,
Una."

"What on earth would Auntie say?" said Una helplessly.

"Mrs. Franklin wouldn't object if you told her you were going to be
married in a balloon."

"I don't see how we could arrange--oh, Ted, it's absurd."

"'Tisn't. It's highly sensible. I'll go straight to town on my wheel
for the licence and ring and I'll be back in an hour. You can be ready
by that time."

For a moment Una hesitated. Then she said suddenly to me, "What is
your name, dearie?"

"Sue Murray," I said, "and this is my brother, Johnny. We're twins.
We've been twins for ten years."

"Well, Sue, I'm going to let you decide for me. This gentleman here,
whose name is Theodore Prentice, has to start for Japan in two days
and will have to remain there for four years. He received his orders
only yesterday. He wants me to marry him and go with him. Now, I shall
leave it to you to consent or refuse for me. Shall I marry him or
shall I not?"

"Marry him, of course," said I promptly. Johnny says she knew I would
say that when she left it to me.

"Very well," said Una calmly. "Ted, you may go for the necessaries.
Sue, you must be my bridesmaid and Johnny shall be best man. Come,
we'll go into the house and break the news to Auntie."

I never felt so interested and excited in my life. It seemed too good
to be true. Una and I went into the house and there we found the
sweetest, pinkest, plumpest old lady asleep in an easy-chair. Una
wakened her and said, "Auntie, I'm going to be married to Mr. Prentice
in an hour's time."

That was a most wonderful old lady! All she said was, "Dear me!" You'd
have thought Una had simply told her she was going out for a walk.

"Ted has gone for licence and ring and minister," Una went on. "We
shall be married out under the cherry trees and I'll wear my new white
organdie. We shall leave for Japan in two days. These children are Sue
and Johnny Murray who have come out to see a wedding--_any_ wedding.
Ted and I are getting married just to please them."

"Dear me!" said the old lady again. "This is rather sudden. Still--if
you must. Well, I'll go and see what there is in the house to eat."

She toddled away, smiling, and Una turned to me. She was laughing, but
there were tears in her eyes.

"You blessed accidents!" she said, with a little tremble in her voice.
"If you hadn't happened just then Ted would have gone away in a rage
and I might never have seen him again. Come now, Sue, and help me
dress."

Johnny stayed in the hall and I went upstairs with Una. We had such an
exciting time getting her dressed. She had the sweetest white organdie
you ever saw, all frills and laces. I'm sure Pamelia's silk couldn't
have been half so pretty. But she had no veil, and I felt rather
disappointed about that. Then there was a knock at the door and Mrs.
Franklin came in, with her arms full of something all fine and misty
like a lacy cobweb.

"I've brought you my wedding veil, dearie," she said. "I wore it forty
years ago. And God bless you, dearie. I can't stop a minute. The boy
is killing the chickens and Bridget is getting ready to broil them.
Mrs. Jenner's son across the road has just gone down to the bakery for
a wedding cake."

With that she toddled off again. She was certainly a wonderful old
