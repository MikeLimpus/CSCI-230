INTRODUCTION

Recent students of criticism have usually placed Rapin in the School
of Sense. In fact Rapin clearly denominates himself a member of that
school. In the introduction to his major critical work, _Reflexions
sur la Poetique d'Aristote_ (1674), he states that his essay "is
nothing else, but Nature put in Method, and good _Sense_ reduced to
Principles" (_Reflections on Aristotle's Treatise of Poesie_, London,
1731, II, 131). And in a few passages as early as "A Treatise de
Carmine Pastorali" (1659), he seems to imply that he is being guided
in part at least by the criterion of "good _Sense_." For example,
after citing several writers to prove that "brevity" is one of the
"graces" of pastoral poetry, he concludes, "I could heap up a great
many more things to this purpose, but I see no need of such a
trouble, since no man can rationally doubt of the goodness of my
Observation" (p.41).

The basic criterion, nevertheless, which Rapin uses in the "Treatise"
is the authority of the Ancients--the poems of Theocritus and Virgil
and the criticism of Aristotle and Horace. Because of his constant
references to the Ancients, one is likely to conclude that he (like
Boileau and Pope) must have thought they and Nature (good sense) were
the same. In a number of passages, however, Rapin depends solely on
the Ancients. Two examples will suffice to illustrate his absolutism.
At the beginning of "_The Second_ Part," when he is inquiring "into
the nature of _Pastoral,_" he admits:
  And this must needs be a hard Task, since I have no guide,
  neither _Aristotle_ nor _Horace_ to direct me.... And I am of
  opinion that none can treat well and clearly of any kind of
  _Poetry_ if he hath no helps from these two (p. 16).

In "_The Third_ Part," when he begins to "lay down" his _Rules for
writing_ Pastorals," he declares:
  Yet in this difficulty I will follow _Aristotle's_ Example, who
  being to lay down Rules concerning _Epicks_, propos'd _Homer_
  as a Pattern, from whom he deduc'd the whole Art; So I will
  gather from _Theocritus_ and _Virgil_, those Fathers of
  _Pastoral_, what I shall deliver on this account (p. 52).

These passages represent the apogee of the neoclassical criticism of
pastoral poetry. No other critic who wrote on the pastoral depends so
completely on the authority of the classical critics and poets. As a
matter of fact, Rapin himself is not so absolute later. In the
section of the _Réflexions_ on the pastoral, he merely states that
the best models are Theocritus and Virgil. In short, one may say
that in the "Treatise" the influence of the Ancients is dominant; in
the _Réflexions_, "good _Sense_."

Reduced to its simplest terms, Rapin's theory is Virgilian. When
deducing his theory from the works of Theocritus and Virgil, his
preference is almost without exception for Virgil. Finding Virgil's
eclogues refined and elegant, Rapin, with a suggestion from Donatus
(p. 10 and p. 14), concludes that the pastoral "belongs properly to
the _Golden Age_" (p. 37)--"that blessed time, when Sincerity and
Innocence, Peace, Ease, and Plenty inhabited the Plains" (p. 5).
Here, then, is the immediate source of the Golden Age eclogue, which,
being transferred to England and popularised by Pope, flourished
until the time of Dr. Johnson and Joseph Warton.

In France the most prominent opponent to the theory formulated by
Rapin is Fontenelle. In his "Discours sur la Nature de l'Eglogue"
(1688) Fontenelle, with studied and impertinent disregard for the
Ancients and for "ceux qui professent cette espèce de religion que
l'on s'est faite d'adorer l'antiquité," expressly states that the
basic criterion by which he worked was "les lumières naturelles de
la raison" (_OEuvres_, Paris, 1790, V, 36). It is careless and
incorrect to imply that Rapin's and Fontenelle's theories of
pastoral poetry are similar, as Pope, Joseph Warton, and many other
critics and scholars have done. Judged by basic critical principles,
method, or content there is a distinct difference between Rapin and
Fontenelle. Rapin is primarily a neoclassicist in his "Treatise";
Fontenelle, a rationalist in his "Discours." It is this opposition,
then, of neoclassicism and rationalism, that constitutes the basic
issue of pastoral criticism in England during the Restoration and the
early part of the eighteenth century.

When Fontenelle's "Discours" was translated in 1695, the first phrase
of it quoted above was translated as "those Pedants who profess a
kind of Religion which consists of worshipping the Ancients" (p.294).
Fontenelle's phrase more nearly than that of the English translator
describes Rapin. Though Rapin's erudition was great, he escaped the
quagmire of pedantry. He refers most frequently to the scholiasts and
editors in "_The First Part_" (which is so trivial that one wonders
why he ever troubled to accumulate so much insignificant material),
but after quoting them he does not hesitate to call their ideas
"pedantial" (p. 24) and to refer to their statements as grammarian's
"prattle" (p. 11). And, though at times it seems that his curiosity
and industry impaired his judgment, Rapin does draw significant ideas
from such scholars and critics as Quintilian, Vives, Scaliger,
Donatus, Vossius, Servius, Minturno, Heinsius, and Salmasius.

Rapin's most prominent disciple in England is Pope. Actually, Pope
presents no significant idea on this subject that is foreign to
Rapin, and much of the language--terminology and set phrases--of
Pope's "Discourse" comes directly from Rapin's "Treatise" and from
the section on the pastoral in the _Reflections_. Contrary to his own
statement that he "reconciled" some points on which the critics
disagree and in spite of the fact that he quotes Fontenelle, Pope in
his "Discourse" is a neoclassicist almost as thoroughgoing as Rapin.
The ideas which he says he took from Fontenelle are either
unimportant or may be found in Rapin. Pope ends his "Discourse" by
drawing a general conclusion concerning his _Pastorals_: "But after
all, if they have any merit, it is to be attributed to some good old
authors, whose works as I had leisure to study, so I have not wanted
care to imitate." This statement is diametrically opposed to the
basic ideas and methods of Fontenelle, but in full accord with and no
doubt directly indebted to those of Rapin.

The same year, 1717, that Pope 'imitated' Rapin's "Treatise," Thomas
Purney made a direct attack on Rapin's neoclassic procedure. In the
"Preface" to his own _Pastorals_ he expresses his disapproval of
Rapin's method, evidently with the second passage from Rapin quoted
above in mind:
  _Rapine's_ Discourse is counted the best on this Poem, for 'tis
  the longest. You will easily excuse my not mentioning all his
  Defects and Errors in this Preface. I shall only say then, that
  instead of looking into the true Nature of the Pastoral Poem,
  and then judging whether _Theocritus_ or any of his Followers
  have brought it to it's utmost Perfection or not. _Rapine_
  takes it for granted that _Theocritus_ and _Virgil_ are
  infallible; and aim's at nothing beyond showing the Rules which
  he thinks they observ'd. Facetious Head! (_Works_, Oxford,
  1933, pp. 51-52. The Peroy Reprints, No. XII)

The influence of Rapin on the development of the pastoral,
nevertheless, was salutary. Finding the genre vitiated with wit,
extravagance, and artificiality, he attempted to strip it of these
Renaissance excrescencies and restore it to its pristine purity by
direct reference to the Ancients--Virgil, in particular. Though Rapin
does not have the psychological insight into the esthetic principles
of the genre equal to that recently exhibited by William Empson or
even to that expressed by Fontenelle, he does understand the
intrinsic appeal of the pastoral which has enabled it to survive, and
often to flourish, through the centuries in painting, music, and
poetry. Perhaps his most explicit expression of this appreciation is
made while he is discussing Horace's statement that the muses love
the country:
  And to speak from the very bottome of my heart... methinks he
  is much more happy in a Wood, that at ease contemplates this
  universe, as his own, and in it, the Sun and Stars, the
  pleasing Meadows, shady Groves, green Banks, stately Trees,
  flowing Springs, and the wanton windings of a River, fit
  objects for quiet innocence, than he that with Fire and Sword
  disturbs the World, and measures his possessions by the wast
  that lys about him (p. 4).

René Rapin (1621-1687), in spite of his duties as a Jesuit priest and
disputes with the Jansenists, became one of the most widely read men
of his time and carried on the celebrated discussions about the
Ancients with Maimbourg and Vavasseur. His _chef-d'oeuvre_ without
contradiction is _Hortorum libri IV_. Like Virgil, Spenser, Pope, and
many aspiring lesser poets, he began his literary career by writing
pastorals, _Eclogae Sacrae_ (1659), to which is prefixed in Latin the
original of "A Treatise de Carmine Pastorali."

               TREATISE


          de CARMINE PASTORALI

            Written by RAPIN.


_The First Part_.

To be as short as possible in my discourse upon the present Subject,
I shall not touch upon the Excellency of _Poetry_ in general; nor
repeat those high _Encomiums_, (as that tis the most divine of all
human Arts, and the like) which _Plato_ in his _Jone_, _Aristotele_ in
his _Poetica_, and other Learned men have copiously insisted on: And
this I do that I might more closely and briefly pursue my present
design, which, no doubt will not please every man; for since I treat
of that part of _Poetry_, which (to use _Quintilian's_ words,) by
reason of its Clownishness, is affraid of the Court and City; some may
imagine that I follow _Nichocaris_ his humor, who would paint only the
most ugly and deform'd, and those too in the meanest and most
frightful dress, that real, or fancy'd Poverty could put them in.

{2} For some think that to be a Sheapard is in it self mean, base, and
sordid; And this I think is the first thing that the graver and
soberer sort will be ready to object.

But if we consider how honorable that employment is, our Objectors
from that Topick will be easily answer'd, for as _Heroick_ Poems owe
their dignity to the Quality of _Heroes_, so _Pastorals_ to that of
_Sheapards_.

Now to manifest this, I shall not rely on the authority of the
_Fabulous_, and _Heroick_ Ages, tho, in the former, a God fed Sheep in
_Thessaly_, and in the latter, _Hercules_ the Prince of _Heroes_, (as
_Paterculus_ stiles him) graz'd on mount _Aventine_: These Examples,
tis true, are not convinceing, yet they sufficiently shew that the
employment of a Sheapard was sometime look'd upon to be such, as in
those Fabulous times was not alltogether unbecomeing the _Dignity_ of
a _Heroe_, or the _Divinity_ of a _God_: which consideration if it
cannot be of force enough to procure excellence, yet certainly it may
secure it from the imputation of baseness, since it was sometime lookt
upon as fit for the greatest in Earth or Heaven.

But not to insist on the authority of _Poets_, _Sacred Writt_ tells
us that _Jacob_ and _Esau_, two great men, were Sheapards; And _Amos_,
one of the Royal Family, asserts the same of himself, for _He was_
among _the Sheapards of Tecua_, following that employment: The like by
Gods own appointment {3} prepared _Moses_ for a Scepter, as _Philo_
intimates in his life, when He tells us, _that a Sheapards Art is a
suitable preparation to a Kingdome_; the same He mentions in the Life
of _Joseph_, affirming that the care a Sheapard hath over his Cattle,
very much resembles that which a King hath over his Subjects: The same
_Basil_ in his Homily de _S. Mamm. Martyre_ hath concerning _David_,
who was taken from following the Ews great with young ones to feed
_Israel_, for He says that the Art of feeding and governing are very
near akin, and even Sisters: And upon this account I suppose twas,
that Kings amongst the _Greeks_ reckoned the name of Sheapard one of
their greatest titles, for, if we believe _Varro_, amongst the
Antients, the best and bravest was still a Sheapard: Every body knows
that the _Romans_ the worthiest and greatest Nation in the World
sprang from _Sheapards_: The Augury of the Twelve Vulturs plac't a
Scepter in _Romulus's_ hand which held a Crook before; and at that
time, as _Ovid_ says,

  His own small Flock each Senator did keep.

_Lucretius_ mentions an extraordinary happiness, and as it were
Divinity in a _Sheaperd's_ life,

  Thro Sheapards ease, and their Divine retreats.

And this is the reason, I suppose, why the solitude of the Country,
the shady Groves, and security of that happy Quiet was so grateful to
the Muses, for thus _Horace_ represents them,

 {4} The Muses that the Country Love.

How enrojeció seeing the borregote! ... As you pass it a second time,
was as delighted with a leg of lamb in the right hand panzudo not
give it to her boss, who was waiting in vain, and which, dropping
a wad round, to threaten with his knife.

  The afternoon was sad.

Sitting at the door of his hut, believed by surprise several times
around each something distant or hidden in Kannada to watch. The
spinner wanted to arrive early on Monday, to go to the factory and
move to the back accompanied by the horrible way Tonet. It made the
boy stopped at nightfall the following day.

Nearer the city still in the remaining days left meeting Roseta. - _
Bona nit! _ But after the usual greeting is not silent. He
seemed shy progressed much during the rest day. And awkwardly,
accompanying their faces with expressions and scratches on the legs
of trousers, was explained, although word passed between word and
sometimes two minutes. Was glad to see it good ... (Roseta smile and
a "_grasies_" murmured faintly.) Was a lot of fun on Sunday ...
(Silencio.) He had gone quite badly. Was bored. No doubt the custom
... then ... it seemed that something was missing .... Sure! law had
taken the road ... no, not the road, what they liked ... and was
accompanied here stopped in its tracks. So it seemed to Roseta is
nervously biting the tongue to punish him for his audacity, and is
pinched in the armpits for having gone so far.

  They walked in silence a long time.

The girl did not reply, continuing his march to succeed contoneo the
spinners, the basket in the left hip and right arm, cutting the air
with a pendulum swinging. Think about their dreams. Imagined to be in
full frenzy, seeing extravagances, and became the head several times
to believe that perceived in the dark dog that Lamia had the hands
and face Tonet, who still remember him laughing. But no, which
leads to the side was a good guy capable of defending it, and shrunk
somewhat shy, though, with the head down, as if the words had yet
to say it had crept up to his chest and they were clicking. Roseta
still more confused. "Let's see: Why was that? Why I walked out to
accompany him on his way? What people say? If her father found out,
what a disgust !...» - _ Per what? ... ¿Per què? _ - Asked the girl.
And the boy, growing sadder, more shrunken as a convicted prisoner
who hear his indictment, nothing responded.

Marching in step with the young, but separated from it by tripping
on the curb.

  Roseta even thought he was going to mourn.
  But close to the hut, where they would
  break up, had a boot Tonet shy. He spoke with the
  same violence that had fallen quiet, and as if not
  many minutes had elapsed, he replied to the
  question of the girl: - _Per what? ...

Perqu'et vullc_. [12] [12] - Why ...

  Because I love you. I told her
  to throw close to their breath in the face, eyes shining as if
they left him the whole truth, and after that, sorry again, fearful,
terrified by his words, began to run as a child.

Tonet! wanted! ... Had two days that she expected these words,
yet the effect of causing an unexpected revelation. She wanted him, and
all night, even in dreams, he heard, murmured a thousand voices with
their ears, the same phrase: "_Perqu'et vullc_. 'He did not wait Tonet
The next night. At dawn he saw Rosetta on the road, almost hidden
behind the trunk of a mulberry tree, looking with anxiety, like
a child who fears the reprimand and is repentant, ready to flee at the
first sign of displeasure. Spinner But blushing smiled, and no more.
Everything was spoken, not again say that they wanted, but it was
agreed the dating thing, and Tonet not miss even once to accompany
him on his way. panzudo The butcher raging anger with the sudden
change of his servant before so diligently and have always inventing
excuses to spend hours and hours in the garden, especially at sunset.
But with the selfishness of his joy, Tonet worried both blocks
and threats from his master spinner as their feared father, to whom
he felt even more afraid that ordinarily respect. Roseta _estudi_
was always in a nest, which claimed to have found on the road. Her
boyfriend did not know show empty-handed, and explore all the
Kannada and trees of the garden to offer to the spinner wheels straw
and sticks, in which few manilimaes background, with pink skin
covered with fine hair and bare ass , piaban desperately, opening a
huge peak of ever ahito crumbs. Roseta kept the gift in your room,
as if the same person for her boyfriend, and she cried when her
siblings, people often find that the nest was shed in force to
admire the birds, eventually wring the neck.

Sometimes Tonet appeared with a lump in the belly: the full range of
lupins and peanuts, bought house _Copa_ and slowly going the way,
ate and ate, looking into each other's eyes, smiling like a fool
without knowing what , sitting in a slopes often without realizing
it. She was the most sensible, and rebuked him. Always spend money!
Two were real or just under a week which had stopped at the tavern
with so many gifts. And he showed generous. Who wanted the rooms but
for her? When married - ever would be - and save money. The thing
there would be ten or twelve years, there was no hurry, all dating
from the garden and lasted one season.

I was getting married again Roseta to reality. The day that his father
knew everything .... ¡Holy Virgin! would deslomarla á garrotazos. And
speaking of the future beating calmly, smiling like a girl accustomed
to such strong parental authority, rigid, imposing and honradota,
that manifests and slapping sticks.

  Their relations were innocent. Never came including
  sharp desire, the courage of the flesh. Marching
  along the road nearly deserted in the
  twilight of dusk and the solitude seemed out of his thinking unclean
any purpose.

Once Tonet inadvertently grazed Roseta's waist, as if he ruborizóse
girl. Were the two very distant to believe in their everyday
encounters could lead to something other than talk and look.

  It was the first love, the expansion of youth
  barely awake, which is content to see, talk
  and laugh with, without any shadow of desire.
  The spinner, which was both frightening and nights desired the
arrival of spring, he saw with concern develop the long twilight
and bright.

Now met her boyfriend in broad daylight, and never missing from
the companion way the factory or in the neighborhood women, who see
them together smiling mischievously guessing everything. The factory
began teasing from His enemies, who when asked ironically married,
and called her nickname of "The Shepherdess" by having a love affair
with the nephew of the uncle _Tomba_. trembling with concern the
poor Roseta. What a beating would win! Any day came the news to his
father. And then when Batiste was the day of his sentence in the
Tribunal de las Aguas, the saw on the road accompanied by Tonet. But
nothing happened.

  The happy event for irrigation saved the girl.
  His father, spared glad harvest limitóse to look at her several
times with entrecejo gathering.

Then the voice said with a slow rate and high stress imperative that
in future only take care of back at the factory, we would know who he
was. And again during a single week. Tonet he had some respect to
Mr.

  Batiste, and was satisfied with ambush near the road,
  to see move to the spinner or follow after far. As the
  days were longer, there were many people along
  the way. But this could not distance extended
  to the newlyweds impatient, and a Sunday afternoon,
  Rosette, idle, tired of walking outside the door of his hut to see
Tonet and believing in all the paths passing away, grabbed a jug
painted in green, and He told his mother that would bring water
from the source of the Queen.

The mother left her to go. Had distracted; Poor girl! had no friends,
and the youth must be given his due. The source of the Queen was the
pride of all that part of the garden, ordered to water wells and
the red liquid and muddy ditch that ran by.

  I was facing á an abandoned farmhouse, and
  was "something old and of great merit" in the words
  of the wisest of the garden: the work of the
  Moors, as _Pimentó_; monument of the era in which the apostles
were baptized by the rogue world, according Oracle stated in the
majesty of man _Tomba_.

In the evening progressed the road, poplar orlados restless with silver
foliage, groups of girls who still wore his pitcher and right on
the head, recalling rhythmic step with his slender figure and the
Greek canéforas.

The parade gave the Valencian some biblical flavor. He remembered
singing Arabic poetry to the woman next to the fountain with the
jug at his feet, joining in a single table, the two most vehement
passions of the East: the beauty and water. The source of the
Queen was a square pond, stone walls with red and having
their water much lower than ground level. Declined to fund six steps,
always green and slippery by moisture. In the face of the rectangle
border stone staircase destacábase with a bas-relief figures
blurred that it was impossible to guess in the whitewashed layer.
Should be the Virgin surrounded by angels, a work of art rude and
naive of the Middle Ages; a voting the time of the conquest, but
clicking a few generations to make better stone figures erased by
the years, and bleached with unscrupulous barbarous curiosity, had
left the slab so that only one package report distinguished woman,
" Queen ', which gave its name to the source: "queen of the Moors",
as must necessarily be in all the tales of the field.

They were not there the little confusion algazara and Sunday afternoons.
Over thirty girls agolpábanse their pitchers, all of them eager to be
the first to fill, but no hurry to leave. Empujábanse ladder at the
close, with skirts gathered between the legs to sink and tilt your
pitcher in the small pond. Shuddered it emerged with the water
constantly bubbles from the bottom of sand, where bunches of
plants were growing gelatinous, green hair flowing, moving in its
liquid crystal prison pulse of the current. Insects known as' weavers'
rayaban with restless legs this clear area. Those who had already
filled their pitchers sentábanse at the edges of the raft, with
his legs dangling over the water, shrinkage then outraged shrieks
each time some kid fell á drinking and looking at the top.

It was a reunion of sparrows rebels. All speak at a time, some
were insulted, other iban flayed the absent making public all
the scandals of the orchard. Youth, free of the paternal
severity, it appeared hypocritical gesture made to the house,
and was with all the aggressiveness of a lack of rudeness expansion.
Those dark angels, who so meekly joys and sang in the church
of letrillas Alboraya to celebrate the holidays of the single,
alone and enardecíanse qualified votes of his conversation with
Carter, talking about things internal to the poise of a midwife.

He fell Roseta with his pitcher, without having found a boyfriend on
the road, even though they walked slowly, often turning her head,
hoping each time leaving a trail. The source of the noisy salon
calloused to it. Caused amazement at the first time the presence of
Roseta: something like the entrance to dwell in a church in the middle
of Mass Alboraya greater. Why was there that 'hungry »?... welcomed
Roseta two or three that had its factory and only if you answered,
tightening his lips and with a disdain retintín. The other, responses
of surprise, followed talking as if nothing had happened, not
willing to give the intruder nor the honor of silence.

Roseta lowered to the fountain, and then fill the jug, pulled out,
adding, his head over the wall, casting a keen eye for across the
plain. - _Mira, look no vindrá_. [13] [13] - Look, look, that will
not come. _Pimentó_ was a niece, the daughter of a sister of
PPT, which stated that; Morenilla, nerve, nose, or roll up insolent,
proud of being unique in your home and that his father was not
anyone's tenant, since the four were working very own. Yes, I would
be looking far, not come. Do not know the others who would? Well,
her boyfriend, the grandson of Uncle _Tomba_. Oops a compromise
And the thirty cruel mouths began to laugh as if bitten, not because I
find a great joke to the thing, but overwhelmed by the daughter of
the hated Batiste. - _ The 'Pastora »!_...- --- "said some.
_ The "Divina Pastora »!_... Roseta won the shoulder with an
expression of indifference.

He hoped this nickname. Also, the jokes of the factory had dulled its
susceptibility. Cargóse and the pitcher up the rungs, but the latter
was arrested by the voice mimosa's niece _Pimentó_.

How this biting vermin! ... Never be the wife of the grandson of
Uncle _Tomba_. It was an unhappy, an 'starved to death, but very
honest and unable to match with a family of thieves. Almost unbraided
his waterpot Roseta. Enrojeció, as if these words, ripping the heart,
would have to upload all the blood to his face, then quedóse
white, pale with death. - _ Who is Lladro? Who? _ [14] - asked in a
voice that made temblona laugh all of the source. [14] - Who's
a thief? Who Who? His father. _Pimentó_, His uncle, he knew well, and
at home _Copa_ not mentioned otherwise.

I thought the past was to be hidden? Fled her village because they
knew there too, so had come to the garden to take over what was not
theirs. So were reports that Mr. Batiste had been in prison for bad
things ... And thus the continued Viborillas, dropping everything in
her house and heard in the valley: lies forged by the lost house _Copa_,
a warp of slander invented by _Pimentó_, which is increasingly
being felt least prepared to face to face attack á Batiste,
harassed and tried, tired and hurt by the insult.

The strength of the father appeared suddenly in Roseta, tremulous,
balbuciente rabies graining and with eyes of blood. Let the pitcher,
which was shattered, dunking the girls more immediate, which
protested in chorus calling beast. But it was good to look at such
things! - _ Mon !_...-- shouted stop moving toward the insolent -.
Lladró ¿_Mon stop ... Tórnau again and trenque'ls et morros_. [15] [15]
- My father a thief? ... I repeat and you break the muzzle. They
could not repeat the Morenilla, because before he gets to open his
mouth, he received a punch in it, while the other hand Roseta sank
in his topknot. Instinctively, moved by the pain, it also grabbed
the blond hair of the spinner, and for several minutes, the two
curved saw, firing cries of pain and anger, with the front near
the ground, dragging each other with cruel jerks each gave the hair of
the other. Fork fell to rid the braids.

His hair seemed opulent warriors banners, floating and non-winners,
but twisted and martyred by the hands of the enemy. Roseta But, stronger
or more mad, managed disengaged, and would drag his adversary, perhaps
gave a spanking internal then with your free hand struggling to
take off a shoe, something unheard of when it happened, irritable,
brutal.

Without prior agreement, as if the hatred of their families, phrases
and curses heard in their barracks they arise overnight, dropped to
all a time on Batiste's daughter. - _ Lladrona! ¡Lladrona Roseta !_...
disappeared under the threatening arms. Cubrióse scratches on his face.
Overwhelmed by so many blows, neither could fall, as the same enemy
apreturas retained their right. But pushed to and fro, finally rolling
on the slippery steps, and her forehead hit the edge of a stone.

  Blood!! ... It was like a stone at a tree full

All ran off in different directions, with the pitchers on their heads,
and little time was not in the vicinity of the source of the Queen
rather than the poor Roseta with loose hair, skirts torn, his face
dirty with dust and blood, walking toward his house weeping. How screamed
with anguish the mother to come and view it as a protest to then find
out what happened! Those people were worse than Jews. "O my Lord!
Sir! Could such a crime happen in the land of Christians ...
They are no longer enough to the garden with the men annoy poor
Batiste, libelous before the court to impose fines for unfair. Now
that her children were chasing the poor Roseta, as if she had any

without offending anyone, as God commanded. Batiste, seeing her
daughter bloodied and weeping, palideció, taking some steps to the road
with their eyes fixed on the shack _Pimentó_ whose roofs peeked
on Kannada.

  But he stopped fighting and became more sweetly Roseta.

Lullus_ says it
hath been done,) should we therefore reckon that divine and
incomparable Master of _Heroick_ Poetry amongst the _Lyricks_?

Others with _Cæsius Bassus_ and _Isacius Tzetzes_ hold that that
distribution of _Poetry_, which _Aristotle_ and _Tully_ hath left us,
is deficient and imperfect; and that only the chief Species are
reckoned, but the more inconsiderable not mention'd: I shall not here
interest my self in that quarrel of the _Criticks_, whether we have
all _Aristotles_ books of Poetry or no; this is a considerable
difficulty I confess, for _Laertius_ who accurately weighs this
matter, says that he wrote two books of _Poetry_, the one lost, and
the other we have, tho _Mutinensis_ is of an other mind: but to end
this dispute, I must agree with _Vossius_, who says the Philosopher
comprehended these Species not expressly mentioned, under a higher and
more noble head: and that therefore _Pastoral_ was contain'd in
_Epick_. for these are his own words, _besides there are Epicks of an
inferior rank, such as the Writers of Bucolicks_. _Sincerus_, as
_Minturnus_ quotes him, is of the same mind, for thus he delivers his
opinion concerning _Epick Verse_: _The matters about which these
numbers may be employed is various; either mean and low, as in
Pastorals, great and lofty, as when {19} the Subject is Divine Things,
or Heroick Actions, or of a middle rank, as when we use them to
deliver precepts in:_ And this likewise he signifys before, where he
sets down three sorts of _Epicks_: _one of which, says he, is divine,
and the most excellent by much in all Poetry_; the _other the lowest
but most pure, in which Theocritus excelled, which indeed shews
nothing of Poetry beside the bare numbers_: These points being thus
settled, the remaining difficultys will be more easily dispatched.

For as in _Dramatick_ Poetry the Dignity and meanness of the
_Persons_ represented make two different _Species of imitation_ the
one _Tragick_, which agrees to none but great and Illustrious persons,
the other _Comick_, which suits with common and gentile humors: so in
_Epick_ too, there may be reckoned two sorts of _Imitation_, one of
which belongs to _Heroes_, and that makes the _Heroick_; the other to
_Rusticks_ and _Sheapards_ and that constitutes the _Pastoral_, now as
a _Picture_ imitates the Features of the face, so _Poetry_ doth
action, and tis not a representation of the Person but the Action.

From all which we may gather this definition of Pastoral: _It is the
imitation of the Action of a Sheapard, or of one taken under that
Character_: Thus _Virgil's Gallus_, tho not really a _Sheapard_, for
he was a man of great quality in _Rome_, yet belongs to _Pastoral_,
because he is represented like a Sheapard: hence the Poet:

  {20} The Goatherd and the heavy Heardsmen came,
  And ask't what rais'd the deadly Flame.

The _Scene_ lys amongst Sheapards, the _Swains_ are brought in, the
_Herdsmen_ come to see his misery, and the fiction is suited to the
real condition of a _Sheapard_; the same is to be said for his
_Silenus_, who tho he seems lofty, and to sound to loud for an oaten
reed, yet since what he sings he sings to _Sheapards_, and suits his
Subject to their apprehensions, his is to be acknowledged _Pastoral_.
This rule we must stick to, that we might infallibly discern what is
stricktly _Pastoral_ in _Virgil_ and _Theocritus_, and what not: for
in _Theocritus_ there are some more lofty thoughts which not having
any thing belonging to Sheapards for their Subject, must by no means
be accounted _Pastoral_, But of this more in its proper place.

My present inquiry must be what is the _Subject Matter_ of a
_Pastoral_, about which it is not easy to resolve; since neither from
_Aristotle_, nor any of the _Greeks_ who have written _Pastorals_, we
can receive certain direction. For sometimes they treat of high and
sublime things, like _Epick Poets_; what can be loftier than the whole
_Seaventh Idyllium of Bias_ in which _Myrsan_ urges _Lycidas_ the
Sheapard to sing the Loves of _Deidamia_ and _Achilles_. For he
begins from _Helen's_ rape, and goes on to the revengful fury of the
_Atrides_, and shuts up in one _Pastoral_, all that is great and
sounding in _Homers Iliad_.

  {21} Sparta was fir'd with Rage
  And gather'd Greece to prosecute Revenge.

And _Theocritus_ his verses are sometimes as sounding and his
thoughts as high: for upon serious consideration I cannot mind what
part of all the _Heroicks_ is so strong and sounding as that
_Idyllium_ on _Hercules_ *leontophonô* in which _Hercules_ himself
tells _Phyleus_ how he kill'd the Lyon whose Skin he wore: for, not to
mention many, what can be greater than this expression.

  And gaping Hell received his mighty Soul:

Why should I instance in the *dioskouroi*, which hath not one line
below Heroick; the greatness of this is almost inexpressible.

  *anêr hyperoplos enêmeros, endiaaske
    deinos idein*

And some other pieces are as strong as these, such is the _Panegyrick
on Ptolemy_, _Helen's Epithalamium_, and the Fight of young _Hercules_
and the Snakes: now how is it likely that such Subjects should be fit
for _Pastorals_, of which in my opinion, the same may be said which
_Ovid_ doth of his _Cydippe_.

  Cydippe, Homer, doth not fit thy Muse.

For certainly _Pastorals_ ought not to rise to the Majesty of
_Heroicks_: but who on the other side {22} dares reprehend such great
and judicious Authors, whose very doing it is Authority enough? What
shall I say of _Virgil_? who in his Sixth _Eclogue_ hath put together
allmost all the particulars of the fabulous Age; what is so high to
which _Silenus_ that Master of Mysterys doth not soar?

  For lo! he sung the Worlds stupendious birth,
  How scatter'd seeds of sea, of Air, and Earth,
  And purer Fire thro universal night
  And empty space did fruitfully unite:
  From whence th' innumerable race of things
  By circular successive order springs:

And afterward

  How Pyrra's Stony race rose from the ground,
  And Saturn reign'd with Golden plenty crown'd,
  How bold _Prometheus_ (whose untam'd desire,
  Rival'd the Sun with his own Heavenly Fire)
  Now doom'd the _Scythian_ Vulturs endless prey
  Severely pays for Animating Clay:

So true, so certain 'tis, that nothing is so high and lofty to which
_Bucolicks_ may not successfully aspire. But if this be so, what will
become of _Macrobius, Georgius Valla, Julius Scaliger, Vossius,_ and
the whole company of Grammarians? who all affirm that simplicity and
meanness is so essential to _Pastorals_, that it ought to be confin'd
to the State, Manners, Apprehension and even common phrases of
Sheapards: for nothing can {23} be said to be _Pastoral_, which is not
accommodated to their condition; and for this Reason _Nannius
Alcmaritanus_ in my opinion is a trifler, who, in his comments on
_Virgils Eclogues_, thinks that those sorts of Composures may now and
then be lofty, and treat of great subjects: where he likewise divides
the matter of _Bucolicks_, into _Low_, _Middle_, and _High_: and makes
_Virgil_ the Author of this Division, who in his Fourth _Eclogue_, (as
he imagines) divides the matter of _Bucolicks_ into Three sorts, and
intimates this division by these three words: _Bushes_, _Shrubs_ and
_Woods_.

  Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain,
  The Bushes and the Shrubs that shade the Plain
  Delight not all; if I to Woods repair
  My Song shall make them worth a Consuls Care.

By Woods, as he fancys, as _Virgil_ means high and stately Trees, so
He would have a great and lofty Subject to to be implyed, such as he
designed for the _Consul_: by Bushes, which are almost even with the
ground, the meanest and lowest argument; and by Shrubs a Subject not
so high as the one, nor so low as the other, as the thing it-self is,
And therefore these lines

       If I to Woods repair
  My Song shall make them worth a _Consuls_ care.

{24} are thus to be understood, That if we choose high and sublime
arguments, our work will be fit for the Patronage of a _Consul_, This
is _Nanniu's_ interpretation of that place; too pedantial and subtle
I'me affraid, for tis not credible that ever _Virgil_ thought of
reckoning great and lofty things amongst the Subjects of _Bucolicks_
especially since

  When his _Thalia_ rais'd her bolder voice
  And Kings and Battles were her lofty choice,
  _Phoebus_ did twitch his Ear, mean thoughts infuse,
  And with this whisper check't th' inspiring Muse.
  A Sheapard, Tityrus, his Sheep should feed,
  And choose a subject suited to his reed,

This certainly was a serious admonition, implyed by the twitching of
his Ear, and I believe if he had continued in this former humor and
not obey'd the smarting admonition. He had still felt it: so far was
he from thinking Kings and Battels fit Themes for a _Sheapards_ song:
and this evidently shows that in _Virgils_ opinion, contrary to
_Nanniu's_ fancy, great things cannot in the least be comprehended
within the subject matter of _Pastorals;_ no, it must be low and
humble, which _Theocritus_ very happily expresseth by this word
*Boukoliasdên* _i.e._ as the interpreters explain it, sing humble
Strains.

Theefore let _Pastoral_ never venture upon a {25} lofty subject, let
it not recede one jot from its proper matter, but be employ'd about
Rustick affairs: such as are mean and humble in themselves; and such
are the affairs of Shepherds, especially their Loves, but those must
be pure and innocent; not disturb'd by vain suspitious jealousy, nor
polluted by Rapes; The Rivals must not fight, and their emulations
must be without quarrellings: such as _Vida_ meant.

  Whilst on his Reed he Shepherd's stifes conveys,
  And soft complaints in smooth Sicilian lays.

To these may be added _sports_, _Jests_, _Gifts_, and _Presents_; but
not _costly_, such are yellow Apples, young stock-Doves, Milk,
Flowers, and the like; all things must appear delightful and easy,
nothing vitious and rough: A perfidious Pimp, a designing Jilt, a
gripeing Usurer, a crafty factious Servant must have no room there,
but every part must be full of the simplicity of the _Golden-Age_, and
of that Candor which was then eminent: for as _Juvenal affirms_

  Baseness was a great wonder in that Age;

Sometimes _Funeral-Rites_ are the subject of an _Eclogue_, where the
Shepherds scatter flowers on the Tomb, and sing Rustick Songs in honor
of the Dead: Examples of this kind are left us by _Virgil_ in his
_Daphnis_, and _Bion_ in his _Adonis_, and this hath nothing
disagreeable to a Shepherd: In {26} short whatever, the decorum being
still preserv'd, can be done by a _Sheapard_, may be the Subject of a
_Pastoral_.

Now there may be more kinds of Subjects than _Servius_ or _Donatus_
allow, for they confine us to that Number which _Virgil_ hath made use
of, tho _Minturnus_ in his second Book _de Poetâ_ declares against
this opinion: But as a glorious _Heroick_ action must be the Subject
of an _Heroick_ Poem, so a _Pastoral_ action of a _Pastoral_; at least
it must be so turn'd and wrought, that it might appear to be the
action of a _Shepherd_; which caution is very necessary to be
observ'd, to clear a great many difficulties in this matter: for tho
as the Interpreters assure us; most of _Virgils_ Eclogues are about
the Civil war, planting Colonys, the murder of the Emperor, and the
like, which in themselves are too great and too lofty for humble
_Pastoral_ to reach, yet because they are accomodated to the Genius of
Shepherds, may be the Subject of an _Eclogue_, for that sometimes will
admit of Gods and Heroes so they appear like, and are shrouded under
the Persons of Shepherds: But as for these matters which neither
really are, nor are so wrought as to seem the actions of Shepherds,
such are in _Moschus's_ _Europa_, _Theocritus's_ _Epithalamium of
Helen_, and _Virgil's_ _Pollio_, to declare my opinion freely, I
cannot think them to be fit Subjects for _Bucolicks_: And upon this
account I suppose 'tis that _Servius_ in his {27} Comments on
_Virgil's_ _Bucoliks_ reckons only seven of _Virgil's_ ten Eclogues,
and onely ten of _Theocritus's_ thirty, to be pure Pastorals, and
_Salmasius_ upon _Solinus_ says, that _amongst Theocritus's_ _Poems
there are some which you may call what you please Beside Pastorals_:
and _Heinsius_ in his _Scholia_ upon _Theocritus_ will allow but Ten
of his _Idylliums_ to be _Bucoliks_, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 11.
for all the rest are deficient either in matter or form, and from this
number of pure pastoral _Idylliums_ I am apt to think, that
_Theocritus_ seems to have made that Pipe, on which he tun'd his
_Pastorals_ and which he consecrated to _Pan_ of ten Reeds, as
_Salmasius_ in his notes on _Theocritus's_ Pipe hath learnedly
observed: _in which two Verses always make one Reed of the Pipe,
therefore all are so unequal, like the unequal Reeds of a Pipe, that
if you put two equals together which make one Reed, the whole
inequality consists in ten pairs_; when in the common Pipes there were
usually no more then seven Reeds, and this the less curious observers
have heedlessly past by.

The people left behind, according to his shack Batiste moved marcábase
increasingly hostile. The people he encountered on the trails without
him goodnight. Came in a foreign land, and as a soldier who was preparing
to fight the enemy just across the border, Batiste sought in his belt
the ammunition, two bullet cartridges manufactured and posts by
himself, and loaded his shotgun. hombretón The river after doing this.
Good sprinkling would lead to all who attempt to cut off the pace.

He walked slowly, quietly, gozándose breathe in the freshness of
that summer night. But this calm was not prevented from going in
thinking that it was risky to go through the orchard, taking hours to
such enemies. His ear for subtle farmer noticed a noise behind him.
Turned quickly, and the diffuse light of the stars believed to see a
black bag out of the way with leap-quiet and hiding behind a slopes.
Batiste called his shotgun, and riding cautiously approached the
keys to the site. Nobody .... Only at some distance he found that
plants ripples in the dark, as if a body is dragged between them.

He came along: someone was trying to surprise treacherously in the
back. But this suspicion did not last long. Might be some dogs that ran
away when he feels his approach. In short: the fact that someone was
running away from it, was who I was, and had nothing to do there.
Continued by the dark path, walking silently, as a man who knows the
blind spot and prudence not want to draw attention. As close to their
barracks felt more anxiety. This was his district, but it was his
staunchest enemies.

A few minutes before reaching his home, near the farmhouse where
the girls danced blue Sunday, the road was strangled, making several
turns. On one side, a high slopes crowned double row of old mulberry
trees, on the other, a wide canal, whose sloping sides were covered
by thick and high Kannada. This vegetation appeared in the dark
forest indiano, a canopy of bamboo on cimbreándose the way black. The
mass of reeds, shaken by the vientecillo of the night, threw a
mournful cry, seemed smelled betrayal here, so cool and
pleasant during sunlight hours. Batiste, to mock his own restlessness,
exaggerated the danger mentally. Magnificent place to drop a escopetazo
sure! If _Pimentó_ roamed there, not so beautiful despreciaría
occasion. And said this is just left of straight rods and a tongue
of fire shooting, a red arrow, which dissolved a bang, and
something went whistling along with an ear of Batiste. Instinctively
he threw .... bent over, trying lobreguez confused with the land, not
to submit to the enemy target. And at the same time shone a second
flash, sounded another blast, confused alive with the echoes of the
first, and Batiste in the left shoulder he felt a tearing pain,
something like a steel fingernail scratched the surface. Barely stopped
This attention. I felt a wild joy. Two shots ... the enemy was unarmed.
- _ Christ! ¡Ara't caught! _ [27] [27] - Christ! Now you crook! Was
launched among the reeds, almost rolling down the slope of the banks
of the canal, and was inserted into the water to the waist, feet in
the mud, arms high, very high to prevent it mojase the gun, saving
two shots stingy until fired safely. cruzábanse before his eyes
reeds, forming tight vault, almost flush with water. Front of him was
playing in lobreguez a dull splash, as if a dog run down canal ....
There was the enemy: it! Crazy and start a career in the deep
channel, go groping in the shadows, leaving missed espadrilles
silt in the bed with your pants stuck to the meat, braces, heavy,
hampering movements, receiving the slap in the face of the cane
stalk, scratch the leaves rigid and sharp.

There was a time when we see something black Batiste believed
that cling to the cane by pushing up the slopes. Trying to escape
... fire!

His hands felt itching of the murder laid the shotgun to his
face, left the trigger ... the shot rang, and the package fell
from a canal in the rain of leaves and broken reeds. Get it! Get
him! ... Batiste returned again to hear that splash dog run, but now
with more force, as if driven by the escape extreme despair. It was a
dizzying race through the darkness of the vegetation and water. Slip
in the two blanducho ground, unable to grasp by the canes do not drop
the gun; arremolinábase water, beaten by the furious race, and Batiste,
who fell to his knees several times, only thought of stretching his
arms to keep his gun outside the area, saving the reserve draft.
And so the manhunt continued, groping in the dark, deep, until a
revolt in the canal came to a cleared area, with slopes clean
canes.'s eyes Batiste, accustomed to lobreguez the plant canopy, saw
quite clearly a man who, relying on the shotgun, left reeling from
the canal, moving with difficulty his legs loaded with mud. ... It
was him He! The usual! - _ Lladro ... Lladro: no t'escaparás! _ [28] -
rugió Batiste, firing his second shot from the bottom of the ditch
with the safety of the shooter can aim well and that knows that
meat does. "[28] - Thief ... thief: do not escape!

  saw him headlong fall heavily on the
  slopes and then crawl to the water does not roll up.

Batiste wanted to reach, but with so much haste, that he was giving a
false step, fell over when it was at the bottom of the ditch. His
head was sunk in the mud, swallowing the liquid and earthy red, believed
to die, be buried at the bed of mud, and finally, with a mighty effort,
he managed to straighten, drawing water out of their limo for the blind
eyes, his mouth sucking the longing winds of the night. hardly regained
sight, looking for his enemies . Had disappeared. Dripping mud and
water out of the ditch, climbed the slope on the same site as
his opponent, but when she saw him not get up. In the dry land were
marked some black spots, and played with the hands.

  Smelled blood. Well he knew that he had not missed their shot.

But in vain sought to contrast with the desire to see his corpse.
_Pimentó_ That was the hard skin, blood and mud and throwing may
be dragged to his shack. It should be a vague thought that rubbing
perceive the immediate areas like a big snake crawling on the
rows, for all the dogs bark in the garden with desperate howls.
He had heard the same crawl quarter of an hour before, no doubt trying
to kill him in the back, to be discovered and he fled to kiss the
way to bet beyond Cañar in leafy, safe and stalking. Batiste afraid
of soon. He was alone in the middle of the plain, completely disarmed,
his shotgun, lack of ammunition, but that was no longer a weak club.
_Pimentó_ Could not back against him, but he had friends. And
dominated by sudden terror, ran away, looking through the fields the
way that led to his barrack. The plain shuddered alarm. The four shots
in the middle of the night had in shock the whole outline. Dogs
bark, increasingly angry, entreabríanse doors villages and barracks,
throwing black silhouettes was certainly not left empty-handed.
Entendíanse With whistles and shouts of convecinos long distances.
Tiros night could be a sign of fire, thieves, who knows what! ...
certainly nothing good, and the men left their homes ready to do
anything with the dedication and solidarity of those living in the
countryside. Frightened by this movement, Batiste ran towards his
hut, bent many times to go unnoticed under or the slopes of the
big piles of straw. It was his home, with the door open and illuminated
in the center of the red black box packages from his family.
The dog sniffs it, and was the first to greet you. Teresa Roseta and
gave a shout of joy. - _Batiste, Are you tú_ - _ Stop!
Stop !_... And all rushed to him, at the entrance of the hut, under
the old vine, through whose branches worms shone as the stars
of light. The mother, with his fine ear and women concerned
alarmed by the late husband's, had heard far, far away, four shots,
and his heart gave a roll, she said. The whole family had been launched
at the door, eager devouring the dark horizon, convinced that the
plain alarming explosions that had some relationship with the father's
absence.

Locos happy to see him and hear his words, not set in face smeared
mud in their bare feet in the dirty clothes and dripping mud. He
pushed inward. Rosette hanging from his neck, sighed lovingly, her
eyes still moist - _ Stop! Stop !_... But _pare_ could not contain a
face of suffering, a 'alas' drowned and painful. An arm of Roseta
was supported in his left shoulder in the same place where he suffered
the tear in the nail of steel, and which now feels increasingly
overwhelming weight. Upon entering the tent and give a full view
of the lamp, women and children launched a cry of astonishment. They
saw the bloody shirt ... and outlaw its facade, as if you escape from
a prison out the latrine. Rosette and her mother bursts into wailing.
'Holy Queen! ... And Lady Sovereign! You killed ?...»

But Batiste, who felt a pain in the shoulder increasingly unbearable,
drew from the disarray with their sullen gesture soon saw that he
had. Roseta, more lively, and tore the thick rough shirt to leave the
uncovered shoulder ... How much blood! The girl palideció, making
efforts not to faint. Batistet and small began to mourn and Teresa
continued screaming as if her husband is in the agony. But the
hurt was not to suffer lamentations and protested with rudeness.
Less crying: it was little, the evidence was that he could move his
arm, but felt increasingly more weight on the shoulder. It was a
scratch, a bullet grazes and nothing else. Felt that too strong to
be seriously injured. Let's see! ... water, rags, lint, a bottle of
arnica Teresa kept as miraculous remedy in your _estudi_ ... ¡Move!
If it was not all be looking for with the mouth open. Teresa turned
around his room, looking at the bottom of the purse, ripping paintings
sliding sales, while she washed and washed again in that cleft lip
bloody started as a fleshy sablazo the shoulder.

The two women were able to tackle as a bleeding wound blindfolded,
Batiste and breathed with satisfaction, as if they were already
healed. worst blow fell on him in his life. and devoted himself to
preaching to the small they were conservative. Everything they had
seen, not a word to anyone. Were matters that should be forgotten.
And the same is repeated to his wife, who spoke to alert the doctor.
It was worth as much as the attention of justice. Curándose and go it
alone, his skin did miracles. What mattered was that no one is
mixed in what happened down there. Who knows how those hours would
be ... other! While his wife helped him change his clothes and preparing
the bed, Batiste told him what happened. The woman opened her eyes
with an expression of horror, sighed thinking of the danger faced
by her husband and threw glances concern to the closed door of the
hut, as if it were to filter the Guardia Civil.

  Batistet Meanwhile, with a early
  caution, took the shotgun and in the light of the lamp dried,
cleaned their guns, trying to erase any sign of her recent use, it
could happen.

The night was bad for the whole family.

  Batiste Camón delire in the _estudi_.

He had fever, agitábase furious, as if it still runs through the channel
of the canal chasing the man and his cries to scare the small and
the two women, who spent the night clear to clear, seated next to the
bed, offering each instant sugar water, the only home remedy that
managed to invent. The next day the tent was surrounding her door all
morning. The wounded seemed to be better kids, her eyes red for
insomnia remained motionless in the yard, sitting on the manure,
carefully following all the stupid moves of animals housed there.

Teresa Vega glimpse through the door ajar, After returning to the
side of Batiste .... What people! All contour passing along the
path towards the hut of _Pimentó_. She looked around her in an anthill
men ... and all his face fosca, speaking loudly, between vigorous hand
wringing, perhaps throwing glances away from hatred of the old
shack _Barret_. Her husband grunts welcomed this news. Beetles something
deep in the chest causing damage. This movement toward the garden
shed of his enemy was a proof that he was serious _Pimentó_.
Maybe he was going to die. I was sure that the two bullets from his
rifle was still in the body. And now, what would happen ... ¿He die in
prison, the poor guy _Barret_ ... No, continue to be the custom of
the orchard, respect for the justice's own hands. Callari is the
dying, leaving their friends, _Terreròla_ or others, the task of
revenge. And Batiste did not know what to fear more, if the justice of
the city or the garden. Began to fall afternoon, when the wounded,
ignoring the protests and pleas of two women jumped out of his
Camón.

  Is drowned, his body athlete, accustomed to fatigue, could not
withstand long hours of immobility.

The heaviness of the shoulder prompted him to change position, as if
this could get rid of pain. With faltering step, numb for the rest,
came out of the shack, sitting under the arbor, a bench of bricks. The
evening was desapacible, a wind blew too fresh for the season. Black
clouds covered the sun, and under them desplomábase light, closing
the horizon like a curtain of pale gold. Miró Batiste vaguely towards
the area of the city, turning its back on barracks _Pimentó_, now
it was clear, to be deprived areas of the curtain that hid harvest
before mowing. feel the hurt at the same time the impulse of
curiosity and fear to see too, but at last the eyes turned slowly towards
the house of his adversary . Yes, many people gathered at the door:
men, women and children throughout the valley, which ran anxious to
visit his vanquished libertador. odiarle How should those people!

... Were away, and yet guessed his name ringing in everyone's lips.
Buzz in your ears, the beat of their temples by the burning fever,
believed to perceive the threatening whisper of that nest. Yet he
well knew that God had not done more to defend itself, which wanted
to keep theirs without causing harm to anyone. What fault was
found in conflict with some people who, like Mr. Joaquin said the
teacher, were very good, but very beasts ... ended the evening, the
sunset looming over the valley a light gray and sad. The wind was
growing stronger, brought to a remote shack cries echo and angry
voices. Batiste swirling saw people at the door of the tent away, and
with arms raised after many expressions of pain, tense hands you
start the head scarf thrown to the ground with anger. He felt the
hurt that his blood flowing to his heart stopped as he stopped a few
moments, then beat more strongly, throwing a wave to his face red
and burning. guessed what happened over there, it said heart _Pimentó_
had just died. Batiste trembled with fear and cold, was a
feeling of weakness, as if you suddenly abandon their forces, and
got into his hut, not breathing normally until saw that the door
lock and turned the lamp cast. The evening was dark. The dream to
overwhelm the family, tired rendered by the vigil of the night before.
Little dinner, and before the nine were all in bed. Batiste felt
better of his wound. The peso had fallen on his shoulder, he is
no longer dominated by fever, but now was racked a strange pain
in my heart.

  _estudi_ In the darkness and still awake, saw a figure emerge pale,
indeterminate, which was gradually taking contour and colors to be
_Pimentó_ as he saw him in recent days, with the head entrapajada
threatening gesture and his stubborn vindictive.

Molestábale this vision, and closed his eyes to sleep. Absolute
darkness, the dream was seized from him ....
And any one may find a great many of the like in _Theocritus_ and
_Virgil_, if with a leisurely delight he nicely examines their
delicate Composures: And this I account the greatest grace in
_Pastorals_, which in my opinion those that write _Pastorals_ do not
sufficiently observe: 'Tis true Ours (the _French_) and the _Italian_
language is to babling to endure it; This is the Rock on which those
that write _Pastorals_ in their _Mother_ tongue are usually split, But
the _Italians_ are inevitably lost; who having store of _Wit_, a very
subtle invention and flowing fancy, cannot contain; everything that
comes into their mind must be poured out, nor are they able to endure
the least restraint: as is evident from _Marinus's_ _Idylliums_, and a
great many of that nation who have ventur'd on such composures; For
unless there are many {41} stops and breakings off in the series of a
_Pastoral_, it can neither be pleasing nor artificial: And in my
Opinion _Virgil_ excells _Theocritus_ in this, for _Virgil_ is
neither so continued, nor so long as _Theocritus_; who indulges too
much the garrulity of his _Greek_; nay even in those things which he
expresseth he is more close, and more cautiously conceals that part
which ought to be dissembled: And this I am sure is a most admirable
part of Eloquence; as _Tully_ in his Epistle to _Atticus_ says, _'Tis
rare to speak Eloquently, but more rare to be eloquently silent_: And
this unskillful _Criticks_ are not acquainted with, and therefore are
wont oftner to find fault with that which is not fitly exprest, than
commend that which is prudently conceal'd: I could heap up a great
many more things to this purpose, but I see no need of such a trouble,
since no man can rationally doubt of the goodness of my Observation.
Therefore, in short, let him that writes Pastorals think brevity, if
it doth not obscure his sense, to be the greatest grace which he can
attain.

Now why _Bucolicks_ should require such Brevity, and be so
essentially sparing in _Expression_, I see no other reason but this:
It loves _Simplicity_ so much that it must be averse to that Pomp and
Ostentation which _Epick_ Poetry must show, for that must be copious
and flowing, in every part smooth, and equal to it self: But
_Pastoral_ must dissemble, and hide even that which it would {42}
show, like _Damon's_ _Galatea_, who flies then when she most desires
to be discovered.

  And to the Bushes flys, yet would be seen.

And this doth not proceed from any malitious ill-natur'd Coyness, as
some imagine, but from an ingenuous modesty and bashfulness, which
usually accompanies, and is a proof of _Simplicity: Tis very rare_,
says Pliny, _to find a man so exquisitely skillful, as to be able to
show those Features in a Picture which he hides_, and I think it to be
so difficult a task, that none but the most excellent Wits can attempt
it with success: For small Wits usually abound with a multitude of
words.

The third Grace of _Bucolicks_ is _Neatness_, which contains all the
taking prettiness and sweetness of Expression, and whatsoever is
call'd the Delicacies of the more delightful and pleasing _Muses_:
This the Rural _Muses_ bestow'd on _Virgil_, as _Horace_ in the tenth
_Satyr_ of his first Book says,

  And _Virgils_ happy Muse in Eclogues plays,
  soft and facetious;

Which _Fabius_ takes to signify the most taking neatness and most
exquisite Elegance imaginable: For thus he explains this place, in
which he agrees with _Tully_, who in his _Third Book de Oratore_,
says, the _Atticks_ are Facetious _i.e._ elegant: Tho the common
Interpreters of these words are not of the same mind: But if by
_Facetious Horace_ had meant _jesting_, and such as is design'd to
make men laugh, and apply'd that to _Virgil_, nothing {43} could have
been more ridiculous; 'tis the design of _Comedy_ to raise laughter,
but _Eclogue_ should only delight, and charm by its takeing
_prettiness_: All ravishing _Delicacies_ of Thought, all sweetness of
Expression, all that Salt from which _Venus_, as the Poets Fable,
rose; are so essential to this kind of _Poetry_, that it cannot endure
any thing that is scurillous, malitiously biteing, or ridiculous:
There must be nothing in it but _Hony, Milk, Roses, Violets_, and the
like sweetness, so that when you read you might think that you are in
_Adonis's_ Gardens, as the _Greeks_ speak, _i.e._ in the most pleasant
place imaginable: For since the subject of _Eclogue_ must be mean and
unsurprizing, unless it maintains purity and neatness of Expression,
it cannot please.

Therefore it must do as _Tully_ says his friend _Atticus_ did, who
entertaining his acquaintance with Leeks and Onions, pleas'd them all
very well, because he had them serv'd up in wicker Chargers, and clean
Baskets; So let an _Eclogue_ serve up its fruits and flowers with
some, tho no costly imbellishment, such as may answer to the wicker
Chargers, and Baskets; which may be provided at a cheap rate, and are
agreeable to the Country: yet, (and this rule if you aim at exact
simplicity, can never be too nicely observ'd,) you must most carefully
avoid all paint and gawdiness of Expression, and, (which of all sorts
of Elegancies is the most difficult to be avoided) {44} you must take
the greatest care that no scrupulous trimness, or artificial finessess
appear: For, as _Quintilian_ teaches, _in some cases diligence and
care most most troublesomly perverse_; and when things are most sweet
they are next to loathsome and many times degenerate: Therefore as in
Weomen a careless dress becomes some extreamly. Thus _Pastoral_, that
it might not be uncomely, ought sometimes to be negligent, or the
finess of its ornaments ought not to appear and lye open to every
bodies view: so that it ought to affect a studied carelessness, and
design'd negligence: And that this may be, all gawdiness of Dress,
such as Paint and Curls, all artificial shining is to be despis'd, but
in the mean time care must be taken that the Expression be bright and
simply clean, not filthy and disgustful, but such as is varnisht with
Wit and Fancy: Now to perfect this, _Nature_ is chiefly to be lookt
upon, (for nothing that is disagreeable to Nature can please) yet that
will hardly prevail naked, by it self, and without the polishing of
Art.

Then there are three things in which, as in its parts, the whole
_Character_ of a _Pastoral_ is contain'd: _Simplicity_ of Thought and
expression: _Shortness_ of Periods full of sense and spirit: and the
_Delicacy_ of a most elegant ravishing unaffected neatness.

Next I will enquire in to the _Efficient_, and then into the _Final_
Cause of _Pastorals_.

{45} _Aristotle_ assigns two efficient Causes of _Poetry_, The
natural desire of Imitation in Man whom he calls the most imitative
Creature; and Pleasure consequent to that Imitation: Which indeed are
the _Remote_ Causes, but the _Immediate_ are _Art_ and _Nature_; Now
according to the differences of _Genius's_ several _Species_ of
Poetry have been introduced. For as the _Philosopher_ hath observ'd,
*diespathê kata ta oikeia êthê hê poiêsis* Thus those that were lofty
imitated great and Illustrious; those that were low spirited and
groveling mean Actions: And every one, according to the various
inclination of his _Nature_, follow'd this or that sort of _Poetry_:
This the _Philosopher_ expresly affirms, And _Dio Chrysostomus_ says
of _Homer_ that he received from the Gods a Nature fit for all sorts
of Verse: but this is an happiness which none partake but, as he in
the same place intimates, Godlike minds.

Not to mention other kinds of _Poetry_, what particular Genius is
requir'd to _Pastoral_ I think, is evident from the foregoing
Discourse, for as every part of it ought to be full of simple and
inartificial neatness, so it requires a Wit naturally neat and
pleasant, born to delight and ravish, which are the qualifications
certainly of a great and most excellent Nature: For whatsoever in any
kind is delicate and elegant, that is usually most excellent: And such
a _Genius_ that hath a sprightfulness of Nature, and is well
instructed {46} by the rules of Art, is fit to attempt _Pastorals_.

Of the end of Pastorals tis not so easy to give an account: For as to
the end of Poetry in General: The Enemies of Poets run out into a
large common place, and loudly tell us that Poetry is frivolous and
unprofitable. Excellent men! that love _profit_ perchance, but have no
regard for _Honesty_ and _Goodness_; who do not know that all
excellent _Arts_ sprang from _Poetry_ at first.

  Which what is honest, base, or just, or good,
  Better than _Crantor_, or _Chrysippus_ show'd.

For tis _Poetry_ that like a chast unspotted Virgin, shews men the
way, and the means to live happily, who afterward are deprav'd by the
immodest precepts of vitiated and impudent _Philosophy_. For every
body knows, that the _Epick_ sets before us the highest example of the
Bravest man; the _Tragedian_ regulates the Affections of the Mind; the
_Lyrick_ reforms Manners, or sings the Praises of Gods, and Heroes; so
that there's no part of _Poetry_ but hath it's proper end, and
profits.

But grant all this true, _Pastoral_ can make no such pretence: if you
sing a _Hero_, you excite mens minds to imitate his Actions, and
notable Exploits; but how can _Bucolicks_ apply these or the like
advantages to its self? _He that reads {47} Heroick Poems, learns what
is the vertue of a Hero, and wishes to be like him; but he that reads
Pastorals, neither learns how to feed sheep, nor wishes himself a
shepherd:_ And a great deal more to this purpose you may see in
_Modicius_, as _Pontanus_ cites him in his Notes on _Virgil's_
_Eclogues_.

But when tis the end of _Comedy_, as _Jerom_ in his Epistle to
_Furia_ says, to know the Humors of Men, and to describe them; and
_Demea_ in _Terence_ intimates the same thing,

  To look on all mens lives as in a Glass,
  And take from those Examples for our Own,

so that our Humors and Conversations may be better'd, and improv'd;
why may not _Pastoral_ be allow'd the same Priviledge, and be admitted
to regulate and improve a _Shepherd's_ life by its _Bucolicks_? For
since tis a product of the Golden Age, it will shew the most innocent
manners of the most ancient Simplicity, how plain and honest, and how
free from all varnish, and deceit, to more degenerate, and worse
times: And certainly for this tis commendable in its kind, since its
design in drawing the image of a Country and Shepherd's life, is to
teach Honesty, Candor, and Simplicity, which are the vertues of
_private_ men; as _Epicks_ teach the highest Fortitude, and Prudence,
and Conduct, which are the vertues of _Generals_, and _Kings_. And tis
necessary {48} to Government, that as there is one kind of _Poetry_ to
instruct the _Citizens_, there should be another to fashion the
manners of the _Rusticks_: which if _Pastoral_, as it does, did not
do, yet would it not be altogether frivolous, and idle, since by its
taking prettinesses it can delight, and please. (Shudders McNaughtan
is as if he was a monster to fight would have been:) For example -
... for example - ... duty - love - respect - obedience! (Gloria gives
her carefree position on him and is quick and proud to:) I obey
only my own sense of rights, I respect anything that is not noble!
That is my duty. (You attach less firmly add:) What love is concerned,
lies not in my power - I do not think I know exactly what love is.But if we must slight
every thing, from which no _profit_ is to be hop'd, all pleasures of
the Eye and Ear are presently to be laid aside; and those excellent
Arts, _Musick_, and _Painting_, with which the best men use to be
delighted, are presently to be left off. Nor is it indeed credible,
that so many excellent Wits, as have devoted themselves to Poetry,
would ever have medled with it, if it had been so empty, idle, and
frivolous, as some ridiculously morose imagine; who forsooth are
better pleas'd with the severity of _Philosophy_, and her harsh,
deform'd impropriety of Expressions. But the judgments of such men are
the most contemptible in the world; for when by _Poetry_ mens minds
are fashioned to generous {49} Humors, Kindness, and the like: those
must needs be strangers to all those good qualites, who hate, or
proclaim _Poetry_ to be frivolous, and useless.


{50} _The Third_ PART

_Rules for writing_ Pastorals.

In delivering Rules for writing _Pastorals_, I shall not point to the
_streams_, which to look after argues a small creeping _Genius_, but
lead you to the _fountains_. But first I must tell you, how difficult
it is to write _Pastorals_, which many seem not sufficiently to
understand: For since its matter is low, and humble, it seems to have
nothing that is troublesome, and difficult. But this is a great
mistake, for, as _Horace_ says of _Comedy_, "It is by so much the more
difficult, by how much the less pardonable are the mistakes committed
in its composure": and the same is to be thought of every thing, whose
end is to please, and delight. For whatsoever is contriv'd for
pleasure, and not necessarily requir'd, unless it be exquisite, must
be nauseous, and distastful; as at a Supper, scraping Musick, thick
Oyntment, or the like, because the Entertainment might have been
without all these; For the sweetest things, and most delicious, are
most apt to satiate; for tho the sense may sometimes be pleas'd, yet
it presently disgusts that which is {51} luscious, and, as _Lucretius_
phraseth it,

  E'en in the midst and fury of the Joys,
  Some thing that's better riseth, and destroys.

His appearance was sad and tired of working animals who obey can be
sustained with resignation while. Now is the moment. Would stay
with him .... How much? - As for you, a friend - said the gypsy
pat on the back - because for you, nice person that he will deal
well with this garment ... what to say and leave in forty deal.
Batiste endured calmly shooting, a man accustomed to such discussions,
and smiled cunningly: - Good: _pos_ because you rebajaré little.
Want _ventisinco_? The Gypsy opened his arms with theatrical
indignation, fell a few steps, is scratched cap made of hair or any
kind of grotesque extremes to express their astonishment. - Mare of
God! ¡Veinticinco hard! ... But you have been fixed in the animal?
Neither could steal it for that price. Batiste But all their cries
answered the same thing - _Ventisinco_ ... _chavo_ one or more. And
the gypsy rushed his reasons which were not few, appealed to the
supreme argument: - _Monote_ ... removal of the animal ... that Mr
setting well. _Monote_ And there was again, jogging and pulling the
halter horse in front of the poor, increasingly bored with so many
walks. - What a wag! Huh? - Said the Gypsy -. If you think it is a
marquise in a dance! And that goes for you hard twenty-five ... -
Not a _chavo_ more - said the stubborn. - _Monote_ ... again. There
are already enough. And feigning outrage again Gypsy back as if the
buyer failed to give any meaning; stop seeing Batiste was really missing
her seriously. - Come on, sir ... What is your grace ... Batiste
¿? Ah! Well you, Bautista: to see what you want and desire that this
jewel is yours, I will do what they would for anyone. Should hard at
thirty-five? Come on, yes. He swears by his salu that this would
not stop for me. This time was even more vivid and gesticulate their
protest to see that the farmer does not soften the cuts and hardly
gave him two more tough. - But as This darling little pearl inspires
you fine? Do they not have eyes to appreciate Usté? Now, _Monote_: á
out again.

Yet in this
difficulty I will follow _Aristotle's_ Example, who being to lay down
Rules concerning _Epicks_, propos'd _Homer_ as a Pattern, from whom he
deduc'd the whole Art: So I will gather from _Theocritus_ and
_Virgil_, those Fathers of _Pastoral_, what I shall deliver on this
account. For all the Rules that are to be given of any Art, are to be
given of it as excellent, and perfect, and {53} therefore ought to be
taken from them in whom it is so.

Do you understand? I can not! (Gloria strongly:) No - I can not
understand. I have no sympathy for - (McNaughtan nervously goes together:)
stop, ie no further! You do not know what you're doing! Will you
do me good? (You frowned, because she finds such a mood unbearable.
It quickly add:) No, I'm not angry - really do not! Wait,
wait - let me just time for me to reflect. (He stands there a moment
and frowned and ballt his hands in excitement. Then he takes
the chair from the end of the breakfast table and sat down
next to Gloria. With a moving effort, gently and patiently to be,
he says:) I think Now I am so far. In any event, I will try. (Gloria
finds:) You Sehn: anything goes, if it is to vigorously end thinks.
(McNaughtan with sudden fright:) No, you do not! Think nothing - I will,
thou shalt feel it! That is the only thing that can help us.

Hear! Do you know - but above all - I forgot: how is you? I think
your nickname. You can not thee well Sophronia call. (Gloria astonished
with reluctance:) Sophronia? ... My name is Gloria. I will always be
called. (McNaughtan, whose anger returns:) Your name is Sophronia, girl!
You were after your aunt, my sister, Sophronia baptized! You did
your first Bible with your name is a gift. (Gloria.) Then my mother
gave me a new name. (McNaughtan annoying:) You had no right to
do so! I will not admit! (Gloria.) They had no right to send me the
name of your sister to give. I do not even know her. (McNaughtan.)
nonsense! Everything I do I can not offer: it has its limits! I do not
have - do you? (Gloria rises; warned:) Are you committed to in this
quarrelsome tone proceed? (McNaughtan horrified, pleading:) No, no -
sit down! Will you? (She sees him and lets him in uncertainty.

  It compels to the hated name to pronounce:) Gloria!

(You are their satisfaction with a slight movement of the lips
and expression is:) So - you see, I only have the desire to show you
that I am your father, my - my dear child.

  

From whence 'tis evident that in _Pastoral_, tho it never pretends to
any greatness, _Invocations_ {55} may be allow'd: But whatever Subject
it chooseth, it must take care to accommodate it to the Genius and
Circumstances of a Shepherd.

Concerning the Form, or mode of _Imitation_, I shall not repeat what
I have already said, _viz._ that this is in it self _mixt_; for
_Pastoral_ is either _Alternate_, or hath but _one Person_, or is
_mixt_ of both: yet 'tis properly and chiefly _Alternate_. as is
evident from that of _Theocritus_.

  Sing _Rural_ strains, for as we march along
  We may delight each other with a Song.

In which the _Poet_ shows that _alternate_ singing is proper to a
_Pastoral_: But as for the _Fable_, 'tis requisite that it should be
simple, lest in stead of _Pastoral_ it put on the form of a _Comedy_,
or _Tragedy_ if the _Fable_ be great, or intricate: It must be _One_;
this _Aristotle_ thinks necessary in every _Poem_, and _Horace_ lays
down this general Rule,

  Be every _Fable_ simple, and but one:

For every Poem, that is not _One_, is imperfect, and this _Unity_ is
to be taken from the _Action_: for if that is _One_, the Poem will be
so too. Such is the Passion of _Corydon_ in _Virgil's_ second Eclogue,
_Meliboeus's_ Expostulation with _Tityrus_ about his Fortune;
_Theocritus's_ _Thyrsis, Cyclops_, and _Amaryllis_, of which perhaps
in its proper place I may treat more largely.

{56} Let the third Rule be concerning the _Expression_, which cannot
be in this kind excellent unless borrow'd from _Theocritus's_
_Idylliums_, or _Virgil's_ _Eclogues_, let it be chiefly simple, and
ingenuous: such is that of _Theocritus_,

  A Kid belongs to thee, and Kids are good,

Or that in _Virgil's_ seventh Eclogue,

  This Pail of Milk, these Cakes (_Priapus_) every year
  Expect; a little Garden is thy care:
  Thou'rt Marble now, but if more Land I hold,
  If my Flock thrive, thou shalt be made of Gold,

than which I cannot imagine more simple, and more ingenuous
expressions. To which may be added that out of his _Palemon_,

  And I love _Phyllis_, for her Charms excell;
  At my departure O what tears there fell!
  She sigh'd, Farewell Dear Youth, a long Farewell.

Now, That I call an ingenuous Expression which is clear and smooth,
that swells with no insolent words, or bold metaphors, but hath
something familiar, and as it were obvious in its Composure, and not
disguis'd by any study'd and affected dress: All its Ornament must be
like the Corn and fruits in the Country, easy to {57} be gotten, and
ready at hand, not such as requires Care, Labor, and Cost to be
obtain'd: as _Hermogenes_ on _Theocritus_ observes; _See how easie and
unaffected this sounds_,

  Pines murmurings, Goatherd, are a pleasing sound,

_and most of his expressions, not to say all, are of the same
nature_: for the ingenuous simplicity both of Thought and Expression
is the natural _Characteristick_ of _Pastoral_. In this _Theocritus_
and _Virgil_ are admirable, and excellent, the others despicable, and
to be pittied; for they being enfeebled by the meanes of their
subject, either creep, or fall flat. _Virgil_ keeps himself up by his
choice and curious words, and tho his matter for the most part (and
_Pastoral_ requires it) is mean, yet his expressions never flag, as is
evident from these lines in his _Alexis_:

  The glossy Plums I'le bring, and juicy Pear,
  Such as were once delightful to my Dear:
  I'le crop the Laurel, and the Myrtle tree,
  Confus'dly set, because their Sweets agree.

For since the matter must be low, to avoid being abject, and
despicable, you must borrow some light from the Expression; not such
as is dazling, but pure, and lambent, such as may shine thro the whole
matter, but never flash, and blind. {58} The words of such a _Stile_
we are usually taught in our Nurses armes, but 'tis to be perfected
and polished by length of time, frequent use, study, and diligent
reading of the most approved Authors: for Pastoral is apt to be
slighted for the meaness of its Matter, unless it hath some additional
Beauty, be pure, polisht, and so made pleasing, and attractive.
Hopefully not. (Dr. Valentine.) The reason is that I am either
totally insane, or rather the past never really in possession of my
common sense I had. Now I am able to do anything - I'm finally
grown up - I am become a man - and your daughter is to a man made out
of me! (McNaughtan unbelievingly:) Are you in love with my daughter?
(Dr. Valentine, his words pour out now in a real flow from his
lips:) Love ... Nonsense! ... It is much more and much higher than
love ... it is life, faith, strength, certainty, paradise ... (McNaughtan
interrupts him with biting scorn:) nonsense, man! What did (you) to
a woman to entertain ... You can not marry. (Dr. Valentine.) Who will
they marry? ...

  I want to kiss her hands, I will kneel at her
  feet, I want to live, I will die for them
  ... and that should satisfy me! Look at her book
  - you see!

(He kisses the handkerchief:) If you give me all your money to
sell these items that I serve as an excuse to go down the beach
and with her to speak again, - I would just laugh in the face. (He
goes against the wanton stages, where he was a waiter come up
from the beach straight into the arms running. The two keep each other
before overturning, they are mutually tightly around the waist to
embrace and hold upside down.) (The waiter delicately: ) Softly, Doctor
- gently! (Dr. Valentine about his own ferocity unpleasant affect:)
Excuse me! (The waiter). Please, doctor - please. This is quite
natural in your old age .-- The gracious lady took me to her book
heraufgeschickt; should I allow you to send it immediately to
bring? (Dr. Valentine.)

  With pleasure!

- And you want me provide you with the taking of a dental
sechswöchentlichen to Treat ...

    (He offers him Dolly five-shilling
  piece on.)

(The waiter, as if this sum his highest expectations überträfe:)
Thank you, Mr.

  Doctor - a thousand thanks! (Dr.

Valentine falls down the stairs.) A very high - young man, very
masculine and well grown! (McNaughtan reduction in grumpy:) And will
quickly make a fortune - no doubt!

  I know how much revenue his sechswöchentlichen amount.

(He goes on the terrace at the iron table and continues.)

  (The waiter philosophically:) Yes, Gracious
  Lord, you never know ...

That's my motto, if you kindly want to forgive, that I had such a
thing . (The philosopher is a moment of gentle sentient waiter back:)
You know, perhaps not even that your drink had not yet affected,
as the company war.
How tender are the lines, and yet what passion they contain! And most
of _Virgil's_ are of this nature, but there are likewise in him some
touches of despairing Love, such as is this of _Alphesiboeus_,

  Nor have I any mind to be reliev'd:

{61} Or that of _Damon_,

  I'le dy, yet tell my Love e'en whilst I dy:

Or that of _Corydon_,

  He lov'd, but could not hope for Love again.

For tho _Pastoral_ doth not admit any violent passions, such as
proceed from the greatest extremity, and usually accompany despair;
yet because Despairing Love is not attended with those frightful and
horrible consequences, but looks more like _grief to be pittied_, and
a _pleasing madness_, than _rage_ and _fury_, _Eclogue_ is so far from
refusing, that it rather loves, and passionately requires them.

must not rise too high, as _Polyphemus's_, _Galateas's_ mad Lover, of
whom _Theocritus_ divinely thus, as almost of every thing else:

  His was no common flame, nor could he move
  In the old Arts, and beaten paths of Love,
  No Flowers nor Fruits sent to oblige the Fair,
  {62} His was all Rage, and Madness:

For all violent Perturbations are to be diligently avoided by
_Bucolicks_, whose nature it is to be _soft_, and _easie_: For in
small matters, and such must all the strifes and contentions of
Shepherds be, to make a great deal of adoe, is as unseemly, as to put
_Hercules's_ Vizard and Buskins on an Infant, as _Quintilian_ hath
excellently observ'd. For since _Eclogue_ is but weak, it seems not
capable of those Commotions which belong to the _Theater_, and
_Pulpit_; they must be soft, and gentle, and all its Passion must seem
to flow only, and not break out: as in _Virgil's Gallus_,

  Ah, far from home and me You wander o're
  The _Alpine_ snows, the farthest Western shore,
  And frozen _Rhine_. When are we like to meet?
  Ah gently, gently, lest thy tender feet
  Sharp Ice may wound.

To these he may sometimes joyn some short Interrogations made to
_inanimate Beings_, for those spread a strange life and vigor thro the
whole Composure. Thus in _Daphnis_,

  Did not You Streams, and Hazels, hear the Nymphs?

Or give the very Trees, and Fountains sense, as in _Tityrus_,

  Thee (_Tityrus_) the Pines, and every Vale,
  The Fountains, Hills, and every shrub did call:

for by this the Concernment is express'd; and of the like nature is
that of _Thyrsis_, in _Virgil's_ _Meliboeus_,

  {63} When _Phyllis_ comes, my wood will all be green.

And this sort of Expressions is frequent in _Theocritus_, and
_Virgil_, and in these the delicacy of _Pastoral_ is principally
contain'd, as one of the old _Interpreters_ of _Theocritus_ hath
observ'd on this line, in the eighth _Idyllium_,

  Ye Vales, and Streams, a race Divine:

But let them be so, and so seldom us'd, that nothing appear vehement,
and bold, for Boldness and Vehemence destroy the sweetness which
peculiarly commends _Bucolicks_, and in those Composures a constant
care to be soft and easie should be chief: For _Pastoral_ bears some
resemblance to _Terence_, of whom _Tully_, in that Poem which he
writes to _Libo_, gives this Character,

  His words are soft, and each expression sweet.

In mixing _Passion_ in _Pastorals_, that rule of _Longinus_, in his
golden Treatise *peri hypsous*, must be observ'd, _Never use it, but
when the matter requires it, and then too very sparingly_.

He explains everything in a satisfactory way. Said that a direct statement
on your part required much more time could not be as sharp and sudden.
Espiar needed an opportunity, prepare your mind free itself of
precipitates severity rejected your courtship, and in three days,
however that he advantage, there were not so many formalities
and preparations. For this I have searched me. Last night, when
leaving your house, accompanied me to mine, and took me a long
lecture.

Well I had I predicted. Love you gave. It's crazy for loving you, and
asks me to intercede for him. - What is it delusion? - Exclaimed
Doña Luz -. Have you thought Jaime? Did you know that with a heart
like mine is not playing? Have you thought well I can not be a
fleeting fad, but a passion that decides the future of all life - If
D. Jaime did not know, had not come to me. If it had not made a
purpose for life, a purpose whose realization depends only on you,
I would not be coming to talk on their behalf. - Do you know D.

  Jaime I'm pobrísima - Know the exact property you
  own. - It is unique - said Doña Luz -. We
  confess: I had myself and a lot of men worse
  opinion. I did not feel able to inspire
  a love so disinterested ambition who seduces
  and smiles, flattered fortune and want to pamper and in Madrid,
as they say, the most proud and beautiful women.

Not that I did not think so, suddenly, he could love a man with such
selflessness. - Well, do not hesitate to don Jaime loves you that
way. You tell me if it. - I do not know what to answer. My gratitude
is immense.

Before gratitude, before they had reason to have it, why ocultártelo?
Don Jaime's elegance, his discretion, his reputation as a courageous
soldier, the noble gallantry of his person, all I am inclined to want
to much either, but the fear of not being loved revolted my pride and
my pride has done everything possible This inclination to stifle
nascent. - And now you know so well paid and that is your inclination,
what you feel, what you think of D.

Jaime - I think and feel ... I must not give away one of them might not
make much appreciate it if you so easily obtained. Furthermore, not
being loved enough. We must think in terms of love. - My daughter!
What other term can have but that will cure the case - it is true, and
that just makes me ponder a lot. I am very rare in nature. I do not
want anyone I love convenience, and disgusts me that someone
should imagine that the influence my love. If I marry D. Jaime, poor
as I am, could not imagine that someone excited me the link to the
desire to leave and go to Madrid Villafría, the position of the
groom, big hopes, and even the same material benefits they already
enjoy? He, moreover, is not rich for our class, and expect hardship,
economic hardship, the awful prose of the home without adequate resources.
I arredra. And I do not arredra for me, if only serves to material
welfare, but because I blush to think that I may be the cause of a
man who lives full of choking. If he stays here with me, I would
sacrifice his ambition, his career, his future. If he carried with him
to Madrid, live very badly, would I do it very sad figure in the
companies he frequents, and who knows if this will move to
stop loving me?
But tho you must be sparing in your _Descriptions_, yet your
_Comparisons_ must be frequent, and the more often you use them, the
better and more graceful will be the Composure; especially if taken
from such things, as the Shepherds must be familiarly acquainted with:
They are frequent in _Theocritus_ but so proper to the Country, that
none but a _Shepherd_ dare use them. Thus _Menalcas_ in the eighth
Idyllium:

  Rough Storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare,
  Are frightful Evils; Springes to the Hare,
  Soft Virgins Love to Man, &c.

And _Damoetas_ in _Virgil's_ _Palæmon_,

  Woolves sheep destroy, Winds Trees when newly blown,
  Storms Corn, and me my _Amaryllis_ frown.

And that in the eighth _Eclogue_,

  As Clay grows hard, Wax soft in the same fire,
  So _Daphnis_ does in one extream desire.

And such _Comparisons_ are very frequent in him, and very suitable to
the Genius of a Shepherd; as likewise often _repetitions_, and
doublings of some words: which, if they are luckily plac'd have an
unexpressible quaintness, and make the Numbers extream sweet, and the
turns ravishing and delightful. Horrific images was what inspired
contemplation of these abandoned fields, and his gloomy misery
even more highlighted with contrasting land nearby, red, well
maintained, full of good vegetables and rows of trees, whose leaves
fall gave a transparent caramel.

  Even those birds fleeing death camps, perhaps for fear of
  animaluchos that rebullían by or under the weed sniff the breath

On the broken roof of thatch, if something was seen fluttering of black

Rapin's _Discourse of Pastorals_ was first published in Latin,
with his eclogues, under the title: Eclogae, cum dissertatione de
carmine pastorali. Parisiis, apud S. Cramoisy, 1659.

The English translation by Thomas Creech, prefixed to his translation
of the _Idylliums_ of Theocritus, appeared in 1684. A second
edition "to which is prefix'd, The Life of Theocritus. By Basil
Kennet", was printed at London for E. Curll, at the Dial and Bible
against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet-street, in 1713, and a third
edition, also printed for Curll, appeared in 1721.
