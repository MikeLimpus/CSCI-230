With the help of these other accounts, among which there is a
considerable group of uniform character (1Kings xx. xxii. 2Kings
iii. vi. 24-xii. 20. ix. 1-x. 27) favourably  distinguished
from the rest, we are placed in a position to criticise the history
of Elijah, and to reach a result which is very instructive for
the history of the tradition, namely that the influence of the
mighty prophet on his age has after all been appraised much too
highly.  His reputation could not be what it is but for the wide
diffusion of Baal worship in Israel: and this is not a little
exaggerated.  Anything like a suppression of the national religion
at the time of Elijah is quite out of the question, and there is
no truth in the statement that the prophets of Jehovah were entirely
extirpated at the time and Elijah alone left surviving.  It
is more sprightly than its title implies, and even less sombre
than the _Friendship's Offering_; and the interest of most of the
prose articles is far from perishable. Two of them by Dr. Walsh--Are
there more worlds inhabited than our globe?--and the First Invasion
of Ireland,--are excellent papers, though too _azure_ for some
who have not the philosophical mind of Lady Mary S----d. Among the
Tales, the Two Delhis; Annie Leslie, by Mrs. S.C. Hall; the
Glen of St. Kylas, by Mr.Jehovah is exalted: he
adhered to Jehovah as the god of Israel, though to please his wife
he founded at Samaria a temple and a cultus of the Syrian goddess.
This being so, Elijah's contest with Baal cannot have possessed
the importance attributed to it from the point of view of a later time.
In the group of popular narratives above referred to, there is no
trace of a religious commotion that tore Israel asunder: the whole
strength of the people is absorbed in the Syrian wars.  The kings
are the prominent figures, and do well and according to their office
in battle: Elijah stands in the background.  From several indications,
though from no direct statements, we learn of the high esteem which
Ahab enjoyed from friend and foe alike (xx. 3I, xxii. 32-34 seq.).
Joram also, and even Jezebel, are drawn not without sympathy (2Kings
vi. 30, ix.  31).  We can scarcely say the same of Jehu, the murderer,
instigated by the prophets, of the house of Ahab (2Kings ix. 10).

It is the fact, certainly, that the prophets' hatred of Baal
succeeded at last in overturning the dynasty of Omri.  But in
what manner was this done?  At a time when King Joram was
prevented by a wound he had received from being with his army in
the field, a messenger of Elisha went to the camp, called the
captain apart from a banquet at which he found him, to a secret
interview, and anointed him king.  When Jehu returned to his
comrades at their wine, they asked him what that mad fellow had
wanted, and, his evasive answers failing to satisfy them, he told
them the truth.  They at once raised him on an improvised throne,
and caused the trumpets to proclaim him king: they were quite
ready for such an exploit, not that they cared in the least for
"that mad fellow."  Jehu justified their confidence by his
astounding mastery in treachery and bloodshed, but he placed his
reliance entirely on the resources of his own talent for murder.
He was not borne along by any general movement against the dynasty;
the people, which he despised (x. 9), stood motionless and horrified
at the sight of the crimes which came so quickly  one after another;
even a hundred years afterwards the horror at the massacre of Jezreel
still lived (Hosea i. 4).  The crown once gained, the reckless
player showed his gratitude to the fanatics, and sent the priests
and worshippers of Baal after the priests of Jehovah whom he had
slaughtered along with all belonging to the royal house (x. 11).

------ the aged portress (Dame Wheeler, Susan's grandmother)
had given us admittance, and we soon stood on the steps in
front of the house, in calm survey of the scene before us.
Hatherden was just the place to like or not to like, according
to the feeling of the hour; a respectable, comfortable
country house, with a lawn before, a paddock on one side, a shrubbery
on the other; offices and a kitchen garden behind, and the usual
ornaments of villas and advertisements, a greenhouse and a veranda.
Now my thoughts were _couleur de rose_, and Hatherden was charming.
Even the beds intended for flowers on the lawn, but which, under a
summer's neglect, were now dismal receptacles of seeds and weeds,
did not shock my gardening eye so much as my companion evidently
expected.Even in the
history of Elijah the admission is made that this struggle
against Baal, in spite of his sacrificial victory on Carmel, was
in the end without result, and that only the judicial murder of
Naboth brought about a change in the popular sentiment.  But
according to 2Kings ix. 25, this murder proved a momentous event,
not because it led, as we should expect, to a popular agitation,
but from the fortuitous circumstance that Jehu was a witness of the
never-to-be-forgotten scene between Ahab and Elijah, and seemed
therefore to the prophets to be a fit person to carry out his
threatenings.

It is certainly the case that the grand figure of Elijah could not
have been drawn as we have it except from the impression produced
by a real character. /1/  But it is too much torn away from the

*************************************
1. The distance of the narrator is not so very great in point of
time from the events he deals with.  He is a North-Israelite, as
the )#R LYHWDH of xix. 3 shows: this may also be gathered from
xix. 8 compared with Deuteronomy i. 2.  A man of Judah could not
easily make so considerable a mistake about the distance, though
we have to remember that with this narrator the situation of
Horeb can scarcely  have been that which we have long been
accustomed to assume.  Another sign of antiquity is the way in
which Elijah is represented as combating Baal in Israel, and in
the land of Sidon associating with the worshippers of Baal on the
most friendly terms (Luke iv. 25 seq.).
*********************************************

historical position it belongs to, and is thereby magnified to
colossal proportions.  It may be said of this class of narratives
generally, that the prophets are brought too much into the foreground
in them, as if they had been even in their lifetime the principal
force of Israelite history, and as if the influence which moved
them had ruled and pervaded their age as well.  That was not the case;
in the eyes of their contemporaries they were completely overshadowed
by the kings; only to later generations did they become the principal
personages.  They were important ideally, and influenced the future
rather than the present; but this was not enough, a real tangible
importance is attributed to them.  In the time of Ahab and Jehu the
Nebiim were a widespread body, and organised in orders of their own,
but were not highly respected; the average of them were miserable
fellows, who ate out of the king's hand and were treated with disdain
by  members of the leading classes.  Amos of Tekoa, who, it is true,
belonged to a younger generation, felt it an insult to be counted
one of them.  Elijah and Elisha rose certainly above the level of
their order; but the first, whose hands remained pure, while he no
doubt produced a great impression at the time by his fearless words,
effected nothing against the king, and quite failed to draw the
people over to his side: while Elisha, who did effect something,
made use of means which could not bear the light, and which attest
rather the weakness than the strength of prophecy in Israel.

VII.III.4. Let us conclude by summing up the results to which we
have been led by  our eclectic pilgrimage through the historical
books.  What in the common view appears to be the specific character
of Israelite history, and has chiefly led to its being called sacred
history, rests for the most part on a later re-painting of the
original picture.  The discolouring influences begin early.  I do
not reckon among these the entrance of mythical elements, such as
are not wanting even in the first beginnings to which we can trace
the course of the tradition, nor the inevitable local colour,
which is quite a different thing from tendency.  I think only of
that uniform stamp impressed on the tradition by men who regarded
history exclusively from the point of view of their own
principles.  Here we observe first a religious influence, which in
the Books of Samuel and Kings turns out to be the prophetical
one.  The view appears to me erroneous that it is to the prophets
that the Hebrew people owe their history as a whole.  The song,
Judges v., though perhaps the oldest historical monument in the Old
Testament, cannot be cited in support of that view, for even if it
were actually  composed by Deborah, the seer stands in no connection
with the prophets.  Least of all can the colleges of the B'ne Nebiim
at Gilgal and other places be regarded as nurseries of historic
tradition: the products which are to be traced to these circles
betray a somewhat narrow field of vision (2Kings ii., iv. 1-6, 23).
The  prophets did not form the tradition at first, but came after,
shedding upon it their peculiar light.  Their interest in history
was not so great that they felt it necessary to write it down;
they only infused their own spirit into it subsequently.

But the systematic recoining of the tradition was only effected
when a firmer stamp had become available than the free ideas of
the prophets, the will of God having been formulated in writing.
When this point was reached, no one could fail to see the
discrepancy between the ideal commencement, which was now sought
to be restored as it stood in the book, and the succeeding
development.  The old books of the people, which spoke in the most
innocent way of the most objectionable practices and
institutions, had to be thoroughly  remodelled according to the
Mosaic form, in order to make them valuable, digestible, and
edifying, for the new generation.  A continuous revision of them
was made, not only in the Chronicles, at the beginning of the
Greek domination, but, as we have seen in this chapter, even in
the Babylonian exile.  The style of the latter revision differed
from that of the former.  In Chronicles the past is remodelled on
the basis of the law: transgressions take place now and then, but
as exceptions from the rule.  In the Books of Judges, Samuel, and
Kings, the fact of the radical difference of the old practice from
the law is not disputed.  In these works also the past is in some
cases remodelled on the basis of the ideal, but as a rule it is
simply condemned.  That is one difference; another has to be
added which is of far greater importance.  In the Chronicles the
pattern according to which the history of ancient Israel is
represented is the Pentateuch, i.e. the Priestly Code. In the
source of Chronicles, in the older historical books, the revision
does not proceed upon the basis of the Priestly Code, which indeed
is completely unknown to them, but on the basis of Deuteronomy.
Thus in the question of the order of sequence of the two great
bodies of laws, the history  of the tradition leads us to the same
conclusion as the history of the cultus.


CHAPTER VIII.  THE NARRATIVE OF THE HEXATEUCH.


In the historical books the tradition is developed by means of
supplement and revision; double narratives occur here and there,
but not great parallel pieces of connected matter side by side.
In the Hexateuch additions and supplements have certainly taken
place on the most extensive scale, but the significant feature
is here that continuous narratives which can and must be understood
each by itself are woven together in a double or threefold cord.
Critics have shown a disposition, if not in principle yet in fact,
to take the independence of these so-called sources of the Hexateuch
as if it implied that in point of matter also each is a distinct
and independent source.  But this is, even _a priori_, very
improbable.  Even in the case of the prophets who received their
word from the Lord the later writer knows and founds upon the earlier
one.  How much more must this be the case with narrators whose
express business is with the tradition?  Criticism has not done
its work when it has completed the mechanical distribution; it
must aim further at bringing the different writings when thus
arranged into relation with each other, must seek to render them
intelligible as phases of a living process, and thus to make it
possible to trace a graduated development of the tradition.

The striking agreement of the different works, not only in
matter, but in their arrangement of the narratives, makes the
office of criticism as now described not less but more necessary.
There is no primitive legend, it is well known, so well knit as the
biblical one, and thus it is no wonder that it became the frame
for many others and infused into them some of its own colour.
This connection is common in its main features to all the sources
alike.  The Priestly  Code runs, as to its historical thread,
quite parallel to the Jehovist history.  This alone made it
possible to interfuse the two writings as we now have them in the
Pentateuch.  That this was not done altogether without violence
is less to be wondered at than that the violence which was done
is so small, and particularly that the structure of each writing
is left almost unimpaired.  This can only be explained from the
intimate agreement of the two works in point of plan.  When the
subject treated is not history but legends about pre-historic
times, the arrangement of the materials does not come with the
materials themselves, but must arise out of the plan of a
narrator: even the architecture of the generations, which forms
the scaffolding of Genesis, is not inseparably bound up with the
matters to be disposed of in it.  From the mouth of the people
there comes nothing but the detached narratives, which may or may
not happen to have some bearing on each other: to weave them
together in a connected whole is the work of the poetical or
literary artist.  Thus the agreement of the sources in the plan
of the narrative is not a matter of course, but a matter requiring
explanation, and only to be explained on the ground of the
literary dependence of one source on the other.  The question how
this relation of dependence is to be defined is thus a much more
pressing one than is commonly assumed. /1/

*****************************************
1. The agreement extends not only to the thread of the narrative,
but also to particulars, and even to expressions.  I do not speak
of _mabbul_ (flood), or _tebah_ (ark), but the following examples
have struck me:-In Q Genesis vi. 9, Noah is said to be _righteous
in his generations_, in J E vii. 1 he is _righteous in his generation_--
an  unusual form of speech, which gave a vast amount of trouble to
the Rabbins and to Jerome.  Similarly Q Genesis xvii. 21, _the son
whom Sarah shall bear at this set time next year_, and JE xviii. 14:
_at the same time I will come to thee again next year, and then
Sarah shall have a son_.  In the same way Q Exodus vi. 12 vii. 1.
(Moses) _I am of uncircumcised lips_. (Jehovah) _See, I make thee
a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet_;
compared with JE iv. 10, 16. (Moses) _I am slow of speech, and of
a slow tongue_; (Jehovah) _Aaron shall be to thee instead of a mouth,
and thou shalt be to him instead of God_.  Comp. Genesis xxvii. 46,
with xxv: 22.
*************************************

This, however, is not the place to attempt a history of the
development of the Israelite legend.  We are only to lay the
foundation for such a work, by  comparing the narrative of the
Priestly Code with the Jehovistic one.  In doing so we shall see
that Buttmann (Mythologus, i. p. 122 seq.) is right in asserting
against de Wette (Beitraege, ii.), that, the Jehovistic form of the
legend is the earlier of the two . /2/

****************************************
2. The line indicated by Buttmann was first taken up again by
Th. Noldeke in his Essay on the main-stock of the Pentateuch,
which opened the way to a proper estimate of the narrative part
of the work.
****************************************

VIII.I.

VIII.I.1 The Bible begins with the account of the Priestly Code of the
creation of the world.  In the beginning is chaos; darkness,
water, brooding spirit, which engenders life, and fertilises the
dead mass.  The primal stuff contains in itself all beings, as yet
undistinguished: from it proceeds step by step the ordered
world; by a process of unmixing, first of all by separating out
the great elements.  The chaotic primal gloom yields to the
contrast of light and darkness; the primal water is separated by
the vault of heaven into the heavenly water, out of which there
grows the world above the firmament which is withdrawn from our
gaze, and the water of the earth: the latter, a slimy mixture, is
divided into land and sea, whereupon the land at once puts on its
green attire.  The elements thus brought into existence, light,
heaven, water, land, are then enlivened, pretty much in the order
in which they were created, with individual beings; to the light
correspond the lamps of the stars, fishes to the water, to the
heaven the birds of heaven, and the other creatures to the land.
The last act of creation is markedly emphasised.  "And God said:
Let us make man after our likeness; and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
the cattle, and over all the living creatures of the earth, and
over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  So God
created man after His own image, in the image of God created He
him, and He created them male and female.  And God blessed them,
and said: Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon
the face of the earth.  And God said, Behold, I have given unto
you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the
earth, and every tree with seed-fruits: to you it shall be for
food: and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the
air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
is life, I have given the green herb for meat.  Thus the heavens
and the earth were made and all the host of them, and on the
seventh day God ended His work, and blessed the seventh day, and
hallowed it."   (Genesis i. 1-ii. 4a).

It is commonly said that the aim of this narrative is a purely
religious one.  The Israelite certainly does not deny himself in
it: the religious spirit with which it is penetrated even comes
at some points into conflict with the nature of its materials.
The notion of chaos is that of uncreated matter;  here we find
the remarkable idea that it is created in the beginning by God.
Brooded over by the Spirit, it is further of a nature for development
to take place out of it, and the trait that the creation is
represented throughout as a separation of elements which in chaos
were mixed together, betrays even now the original design: but
in the Hebrew narrative the immanent Spirit has yielded to the
transcendent God, and the principle of evolution is put aside in
favour of the fiat of creation.  Yet for all this the aim of the
narrator is not mainly a religious one.  Had he only meant to say
that God made the world out of nothing, and made it good, he could
have said so in simpler words, and at the same time more distinctly.
There is no doubt that he means to describe the actual course of
the genesis of the world, and to be true to nature in doing so;
he means to give a cosmogonic theory.  Whoever denies this confounds
two different things--the value of history for us, and the aim of the
writer.  While our religious views are or seem to be in conformity
with his, we have other ideas about the beginning of the world,
because we have other ideas about the world itself, and see in the
heavens no vault, in the stars no lamps, nor in the earth the
foundation of the universe.  But this must not prevent us from
recognising what the theoretical aim of the writer of Genesis i.
really was.  "Our friends, the Camdens, want to live amongst
us again, and have commissioned me to make inquiries for a
residence."
This announcement, as I expected, gave general delight; for Mr.

Camden is the most excellent and most agreeable person under
the sun, except his wife, who is even more amiable than her
amiable husband: to regain such neighbours was felt to be an
universal benefit, more especially to us who were so happy as
to call them friends. My own interest in the house question was
participated by all around me, and the usual enumeration of
vacant mansions, and the several objections to each (for where ever
was a vacant mansion without its objection?) began with zeal
and rapidity.

"Cranley Hall," said one.

"Too large!"
"Hinton Park?"
"Too much land."
"The White House at Hannonby--the Belvidere, as the late people
called it?"
"What! is that flourishing establishment done up? But Hannonby is
too far off--ten miles at least."
"Queen's Bridge Cottage?"
"Ay, that sweet place would have suited exactly, but it's let. The
Browns took it only yesterday."
"Sydenham Court?"
"That might have done too, but it's not in the market. The Smiths
intend to stay."
"Lanton Abbey?"
"Too low; grievously damp."
By this time, however, we had arrived at the end of our list; nobody
could remember another place to be let, or likely to be let, and
confessing ourselves too fastidious, we went again over our
catalogue _raisonée_ with expectations much sobered, and objections
much modified, and were beginning to find out that Cranley Hall
was not so very large, nor Lanton Abbey so exceedingly damp, when
one of our party exclaimed suddenly, "We never thought of Hatherden
Hill!

surely that is small enough and dry enough!" and
it being immediately recollected that Hatherden was only a mile
off, we lost sight of all faults in this great recommendation,
and wrote immediately
to the lawyer who had the charge of letting the place, whilst I
myself and my most efficient assistant, sallied forth to survey it
on the instant.

It was a bright cool afternoon about the middle of August, and we
proceeded in high spirits towards our destination, talking,
as, we went, of the excellence and agreeableness of our delightful
friends, and anticipating the high intellectual pleasure, the
gratification to the taste and the affections, which our renewed
intercourse with persons so accomplished and so amiable, could
not fail to afford; both agreeing that Hatherden was the very place
we wanted, the very situation, the very distance, the very size.
In agreeing with me, however, my companion could not help reminding
me rather maliciously how very much, in our late worthy neighbours,
the Norrises' time, I had been used to hate and shun this paragon
of places; how frequently I had declared Hatherden too distant for
a walk, and too near for a drive; how constantly I had complained
of fatigue in mounting the hill, and of cold in crossing the
common; and how, finally, my half yearly visits of civility had
dwindled first into annual, then into biennial calls, and would
doubtless have extended themselves into triennial marks of remembrance,
if our neighbours had but remained long enough. "To be sure,"
added he, recollecting, probably, how he, with his stricter
sense of politeness, used to stave off a call for a month together,
taking shame to himself every evening for his neglect, retaining
'at once the conscience and the sin!' "To be sure, Norris was a sad
bore! We shall find the hill easier to climb when the Camdens live
on the top of it." An observation to which I assented most
heartily.

On we went gaily; just pausing to admire Master Keep, the
shoemaker's farming, who having a bit of garden ground to spare,
sowed it with wheat instead of planting it with potatoes, and
is now, aided by his lame apprentice, very literally carrying his
crop. I fancy they mean to thrash their corn in the woodhouse, at
least there they are depositing the sheaves. The produce may amount
to four bushels. My companion, a better judge, says to three;
and it has cost the new farmer two superb scarecrows, and
gunpowder enough for a review, to keep off the
sparrows.
Well, it has been amusement and variety, however! and gives him an
interest in the agricultural corner of the county newspaper. Master
Keep is well to do in the world, and can afford himself such a
diversion.
For my part, I like these little experiments, even if they be not
over gainful. They show enterprise: a shoemaker of less genius would
never have got beyond a crop of turnips.
On we went--down the lane, over the bridge, up the hill--for there
really is a hill, and one of some steepness for Berkshire, and
across the common, once so dreary, but now bright and glittering,
under the double influence of an August sun, and our own good
spirits, until we were stopped by the gate of the lawn, which was
of course locked, and obliged to wait until a boy should summon the
old woman who had charge of the house, and who was now at work in
a neighbouring harvest-field, to give us entranceThe sentence of the
judge concludes the investigation.  The serpent is to creep on its
belly, to eat dust, and to perish in the unequal contest with man.
The woman is to bear many children with sorrow, and to long for
the man, who yet will be her tyrant.  The principal curse is
directed against the man.  "Cursed be the ground for thy sake: in
sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.  Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to, thee, and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field, till thou return unto the ground, for
out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
thou return."  Sentence being thus spoken, Jehovah prepares the man
and woman for their future life by making coats of skins to dress
them with.  Then turning to His celestial company, "Behold," He
says, "the man is become like one of us to know good and evil;
and now lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life, and eat, and live for ever."  With these words he drives man
out of Paradise, and places before it the cherubs, and the flaming
sword, which turns every way, to keep the way of the tree of
Life (Genesis i. 4b-iii. 24).

The gloomiest view of life as it now is, lies at the root of this
story.  Man's days are mere hardship and labour and task-work, a
task-work with no prospect of relief, for the only reward of it
is that he returns to the earth from which he was taken.  No
thought appears of any life AFTER death, and life WITHOUT death
might have been, but has been forfeited, now the cherub guards
the approach to the tree of life, of which man might have eaten
when in Paradise but did not.  This actual, cheerless lot of man
upon the earth is the real problem of the story.  It is felt to be
the very opposite of our true destiny; at first, things must have
been otherwise.  Man's lot now is a perversion of what it was at
first, it is the punishment of primeval guilt now resting on us all.
At first man lived in Paradise; he had a happy existence, and one
worthy of his nature, and held familiar intercourse with Jehovah;
it was his forbidden striving after the knowledge of good and evil
that drove him out of Paradise and brought all his miseries upon him.

What is the knowledge of good and evil?  The commentators say it
is the faculty of moral distinction,--conscience, in fact.  They
assume accordingly that man was in Paradise morally indifferent,
in a state which allowed of no self-conscious action and could not
be called either good or evil.  A state like this not being an
ideal one, some of them consider that man gained more than he lost
by the fall, while others admit that it could not be the divine
intention to keep him always at this stage of childish
irresponsibility, and that this cannot be the view of the narrator
either.

But it is plain that the narrator is not speaking of a relative
prohibition of knowledge, but an absolute one: he means that it
is only for God, and that when man stretches out his hand towards
it he is transcending his limits and seeking to be as God.  On the
other side he cannot of course mean to say that conscience is a
doubtful blessing, and its possession to be deplored, or that it is
a thing that God in fact refuses to men and reserves to Himself
alone.  The knowledge spoken of cannot be moral knowledge.  What
could the assertion mean that God would have no one but Himself
know the difference between good and evil, and would deny to man
this knowledge?  One would think that conscience is a thing
belonging specifically to man and not to God.

And what could be the sense of representing Adam and Eve as so
intent to know what was sin and what was virtue?  No one is
curious about that, and sin never came into existence in the way
of ethical experiment, by men's desiring to know what it is.  And
it is manifestly assumed that men knew in paradise that obedience
to Jehovah was good and disobedience evil.  And finally, it
conflicts with the common tradition of all peoples to represent the
first man as a sort of beast; he is regarded as undeveloped only in
point of outward culture.  The knowledge which is here forbidden is
rather knowledge as such, general knowledge, or getting the eyes
opened, as it is afterwards called.  This is what transcends, in
the writer's view, the limits of our nature; prying out the secret
of things, the secret of the world, and overlooking, as it were,
God's hand to see how He goes to work in His living activity, so as,
perhaps, to learn His secret and imitate Him.  For knowledge is to
the ancient world also power, and no mere metaphysic.  This knowing
in the highest sense is the attribute of God alone, who stands in
the creative centre of things and penetrates and surveys the whole;
it is sealed to man, who has to labour and weary himself at little
things.   And yet the forbidden good has the most powerful
attraction for him; he burns to possess it, and instead of
resigning himself in trust and reverence he seeks to steal the
jewel which is jealously guarded from him, and so to become like
God--to his own sorrow.

This explanation is not new; it is the old and popular one, for
which reason also Goethe adopted it in Faust.  One objection
certainly may be taken to it; the words are not merely
_knowledge_, but _knowledge of good and evil_. But good and evil
in Hebrew mean primarily nothing more than salutary and hurtful;
the application of the words to virtue and sin is a secondary
one, these being regarded as serviceable or hurtful in their
effects.  Good and evil as spoken of in Genesis ii. iii. point
to no contrast of some actions with others according to their
moral distinctions: the phrase is only a comprehensive one for
things generally, according to the contradictory attributes which
constitute their interest to man, as they help or injure him:
for, as said, he desires to know not what things are
metaphysically, but what is the use of them. /1/ Besides the

lengthier expression we have the shorter one, knowledge, simply
(iii. 6); and it must also be remarked that the phrase is not:
know the good and the evil, but know good and evil.

But more, we must regard this knowledge not as it affects the
individual, but in the light of history; what is meant is what we
call civilisation.  As the human race goes forward in
civilisation, it goes backward in the fear of God.  The first step
in civilisation is clothing; and here this is the first result of
the fall.  The story is continued in chapter iv.  Adam's sons
begin to found cities, Jubal is the first musician, Cain discovers
the oldest and the most important of the arts, that of the smith--
hence the sword and bloody vengeance.  Of the same tendency is the
connected story of the city and the tower of Babel, in which is
represented the foundation of the great empires and cities of the
world, which concentrate human strength and seek to use it to press
into heaven itself.  In all this we have the steps of man's
emancipation; with his growing civilisation grows also his alienation
from the highest good; and--this is evidently the idea, though it
is not stated--the restless advance never reaches its goal after all;
it is a Sisyphus-labour; the tower of Babel, which is incomplete
to all eternity, is the proper symbol for it.  Alas! my boy, so
beautiful! alas! my love, so brave!
And must your manly Irish limbs still drag it to the grave?
And thou, my son, yet have a son, foredoomed a slave to be?

Whose mother, too, must weep o'er him the
tears I weep o'er thee.

Here, too is an exquisite snatch--on Memory:

Fond Memory, like a mockingbird, Within the widow'd heart is heard,
Repeating every touching tone Of voices that from earth hath
gone.
Queen Catharine's Sorrow is a ballad of mournful minstrelsy. Next
is the Bard's Address to his youngest Daughter, by Mr. Hogg--beginning
Come to my arms, my dear wee pet!
My gleesome, gentle Harriet!
with all the sweetness and affection of shepherd love.Having got rid of this impression we turn to
those features of Genesis ii. iii. which help to determine
positively its relation to chapter i.

What has been untruly asserted of Genesis i. is true of Genesis ii.
iii.  The Jehovist narrative does shine by the absence of all
efforts after rationalistic explanation, by its contempt for
every kind of cosmological speculation.  The earth is regarded as
being at first not moist and plastic but (as in Job xxxviii. 38)
hard and dry: it must rain first in order that the desert may be
turned into a green meadow, as is the case still every year when
the showers of spring come.  The ground further requires
cultivation by man that the seed may  spring forth.  No regard is
paid to any natural sequence of the acts of creation: man, the
most helpless of all beings, appears first, and finds himself
placed on a world entirely bare, without tree or bush, without
the animals, without woman.  Man is confessedly the exclusive
object of interest, the other creatures are accounted for by
their importance to him, as if this only conferred on them a
right to exist.  The idea explains matter: mechanical possibility
is never consulted, and we do not think of asking about it.  Want
of taste could find no lower deeps than when this or that scholar
goes from Genesis ii. 21 to count his ribs, or comes to
the conclusion that the first man was hermaphrodite.
