2  In that saying, Rejoice thou
barren that bearest not, he spake
of us: for our church was barren
before children were given unto it.

3  And again; when he said,
Cry thou that travailest not:
he implied thus much: That after
the manner of a woman in travail,
we should not cease to put up our
prayers unto God abundantly.

4  And for what follows, because
she that is desolate hath more
children than she that hath a husband;
it was therefore added, because
our people which seemed to have
been forsaken by God, now believing
in him, are become more than they
who seemed to have God.

5  And another Scripture saith,
a I came not to call the righteous
but sinners (to repentance). The
meaning of which is this; that
those who were lost must be saved:

6  For that is, indeed, truly great
and wonderful, not to confirm those
things that are yet standing, but
those which are falling,

7  Even so did it seem good to
Christ to save what was lost; and
when he came into the world, he
saved many, and called us who
were already lost.

8  Seeing then he has showed
so great mercy towards us; and
chiefly for that we who are alive,
do now no longer sacrifice to dead
Gods, nor pay any worship to
them, but have by him been
brought to the knowledge of
the Father of truth.

9  Whereby shall we show that
we do indeed know him, and by
not denying him by whom we
have come to the knowledge of
him.

10  For even he himself saith,
Whosoever shall confess me before
men, him will I confess before
my Father. This therefore is our
reward, if we shall confess him by
whom we have been saved.

11  But, wherein must we confess
him?--Namely, in doing those
things which he saith, and not
disobeying his commandments
by worshipping him not with
our lips only, but with all our
heart, and with all our mind. For
he saith in Isaiah; This people
honoureth me with their lips, but
their heart is far from me.

12  Let us then not only call
him Lord; for that will not save
us. For he saith: Not everyone
that saith unto me Lord, Lord,
shall be saved, but he that doth
righteousness.

13  Wherefore, brethren,
let us confess him by our works;
by loving one another; in not
committing adultery, not speaking
evil against each other, not envying
one another; but by being temperate,
merciful, good.

14  Let us also have a mutual
sense of one another's sufferings;
and not be covetous of money; but
let us, by our good works, confess
God, and not by those that are
otherwise.

15  Also let us not fear men: but
rather God. Wherefore, if we
should do such wicked things, the
Lord hath said; Though ye should
be joined unto me, even in my very
bosom, and not keep my commandments,
I would cast you off, and say unto
you; Depart from me; I know not
whence you are, ye workers of iniquity.


CHAPTER III.

     1 That, whilst we secure the other world,
     we need not fear what can befall its in this.
     5 That, if we follow the interests of this present world,
     we cannot escape the punishment of the other.
     10 Which ought to bring us to repentance and holiness,
     14 and that presently: because in this world
     is the only time for repentance.

THEREFORE brethren, leaving
willingly for conscience sake
our sojourning in this world,
let us do the will of him who has
called us, and not fear to depart
out of this world.

2  For the Lord saith, Ye shall
be as sheep in the midst of wolves.
Peter answered and said, What if
the wolves shall tear in pieces the
sheep? Jesus said unto Peter,
Let not the sheep fear the wolves
after death: And ye also fear not
those that kill you, and after that
have no more than they can do unto
you; but fear him who after you
are dead, has power to cast both
soul and body into hell-fire.

3  For consider, brethren, that
the sojourning of this flesh in the
present world, is but little, and of
a short continuance, but the promise
of Christ is great and wonderful,
even the rest of the kingdom
that is to come, and of eternal life.

4  What then must we do that
we may attain unto it?--We must
order our conversation, holy and
righteously, and look upon all the
things of this world as none of
ours, and not desire them. For,
if we desire to possess them we
fall from the way of righteousness.

5  For thus saith the Lord, No
servant can serve two masters. If
therefore we shall desire to serve
God and Mammon, it will be without
profit to us. For what will it profit,
if one gain the vole world, and lose
his own soul?

6  Now this world and that
to come are two enemies. This
speaketh of adultery and corruption,
of covetousness and deceit; but that
renounces these things.

7  We cannot, therefore, be the
friends of both; but we must
resolve by forsaking the one,
to enjoy the other. And we think
it is better to hate the present
things, as little, short-lived,
and corruptible; and to love
those which are to come, which
are truly good and incorruptible.

8  For, if we do the will of
Christ, we shall find rest:
but if not, nothing shall deliver
us from eternal punishment if we
shall disobey his commands. For
even thus saith the Scripture in
the prophet Ezekiel, If Noah, Job,
and Daniel should rise up, they
shall not deliver their children in
captivity.

9  Wherefore, if such righteous
men are not able by their
righteousness to deliver their
children; how can we hope to
enter into the kingdom of God,
except we keep our baptism holy
and undefiled? Or who shall be
our advocate, unless we shall
be found to have done what is holy
and just?

10  Let us, therefore, my brethren,
contend with all earnestness,
knowing that our combat is at
hand; and that many go long
voyages to encounter for a
corruptible reward.

11 And yet all are not crowned,
but they only that labour much,
and strive gloriously. Let us,
therefore, so contend, that we may
all be crowned. Let us run in the
straight road, the race that is
incorruptible: and let us in great
numbers pass unto it, and strive
that we may receive the crown.
But if we cannot all be crowned,
let us come as near to it as we are
able.

12  Moreover, we must consider,
that he who contends in a corruptible
combat; if he be found doing anything
that is not fair, is taken away and
scourged, and cast out of the lists.
What think ye then that he shall
suffer, who does anything that is
not fitting in the combat of
immortality?

13  Thus speaks the prophet
concerning those who keep not
their seal; Their worm shall not
die, and their, fire shall not be
quenched; and they shall be for a
spectacle unto all flesh.

14  Let us therefore repent, whilst
we are yet upon the earth: for we
are as clay in the hand of the
artificer. For the potter if he
make a vessel, and it be turned
amiss in his hands, or broken,
again forms it anew; but if he has
gone so far as to throw it into the
furnace of fire, he can no more
bring any remedy to it.

15  So we, whilst we are in this
world should repent with our whole
heart for whatsoever evil we have
done in the flesh; while we have
yet the time of repentance, that
we may be saved by the Lord.

16  For after we shall have
departed out of this world, we
shall no longer be able either
to confess our sins or repent
in the other.

17  Wherefore, brethren, let us,
doing the will of the Father,
and keeping our flesh pure,
and observing the commandments
of the Lord, lay hold on eternal
life: for the Lord saith in the
Gospel, If ye have not kept that
which was little, who will give
you that which is great?--
For I say unto you, he that is
faithful in that which is
least, is faithful also in much.

18  This, therefore, is what he
saith; keep your bodies pure, and
your seal without spot, that ye
may receive eternal life.


CHAPTER IV.

     We shall rise, and be judged, in our bodies;
     therefore we must live well in them;
     6 that we ought, for our own interest,
     to live well; though few seem to
     mind what, really is for their advantage;
     10 and we should not deceive ourselves:
     seeing God will certainly judge us,
     and render to all of us according to our works.

AND let not any one among you
say, that this very flesh is
not judged, neither raised up.
Consider, in what were you saved
in what did you look up, if not
whilst you were in the flesh?

2  We must, therefore, keep our
flesh as the temple of God. For
in like manner as ye were called
in the flesh, ye shall also come
to judgment in the flesh. Our one
Lord Jesus Christ, who has saved
us, being first a spirit, was made
flesh, and so called us; even so we
also shall in this flesh receive the
reward.

3  Let us, therefore, love one
another, that we may attain unto
the kingdom of God. Whilst we
have time to be healed, let us
deliver up ourselves to God our
physician, giving our reward unto
him.

4  And what reward shall we
give?--Repentance out of a pure
heart. For he knows all things
beforehand, and searches out our
very hearts.

5 Let us, therefore, give praise
unto him: not only with our
mouths, but with all our souls;
that he may receive us as children.
For so the Lord hath said; They
are my brethren, who do the will
of my father.

6  Wherefore, my brethren,
let us do the will of the Father,
who hath called us, that we may
live. Let us pursue virtue, and
forsake wickedness, which leadeth
us into sins; and let us flee all
ungodliness, that evils overtake
us not.

7  For, if we shall do our diligence
to live well, peace shall follow us.
And yet how hard is it to find a man
that does this? For almost all are
led by human fears, choosing rather
the present enjoyments, than the
future promise.

8  For they know not how great
a torment the present enjoyments
bring with them; nor what delights
the future promise.

9  And if they themselves only
did this, it might the more easily
be endured; but now they go on
to infect innocent souls with their
evil doctrines; not knowing that
both themselves, and those that
hear them, shall receive a double
condemnation.

10  Let us, therefore, serve
God with a pure heart, and we
shall be righteous: but if we shall
not serve him, because we do not
believe the promise of God, we
shall be miserable.

11  For thus saith the prophet;
Miserable are the double-minded,
who doubt in their heart, and say,
these things we have heard, even.
in the time of our fathers, but we
have seen none of them, though
we have expected them from day
to day.

12 O ye fools! compare yourselves
to a tree; take the vine for an
example. First it sheds its leaves,
then it buds, then come the sour
grapes, then the ripe fruit;
even so my people has borne its
disorders and afflictions, but shall
hereafter receive good things.

13  Wherefore my brethren, let
us not doubt in our minds, but let
us expect with hope, that we may
receive our reward; for he is
faithful, who has promised that
he will render to everyone a
reward according to his works.

14  If, therefore, we shall do
what is just in the sight of God
we shall enter into his kingdom,
and shall receive the promises;
Which neither eye has seen, nor
ear heard, nor have entered into
the heart of man.

15  Wherefore let us every
hour expect the kingdom of God
in love and righteousness; because
we know not the day of God's
appearing.


CHAPTER V.

A FRAGMENT.

     Man's immortal nature a type of the Lord's kingdom.

1    *    *    *    For the Lord
himself, being asked by a certain
person, When his kingdom should
come? answered, When two shall
be one, and that which is without
as that which is within; and the
male with the female, neither male
nor female.

2  Now two are one, when we
speak the truth to each other, and
there is (without hypocrisy) one
seal in two bodies:

3  And that which is without as
that which, is within;--He means
this; he calls the soul that which
is within, and the body that which
is without. As therefore thy body
appears, so let thy soul be seen by
its good works.

4  And the male with, the female,
neither Male nor female;--He
means this; he calls our anger
the male, our concupiscence the
female.

5  When therefore a man is come
to such a pass that he is subject
neither to the one nor the other of
these (both of which, through the
prevalence of custom, and an evil
education, cloud and darken the
reason,)

6  But rather, having dispelled
the mist arising from them, and
being full of shame, shall by
repentance have united both his
soul and spirit in the obedience
of reason; then, as Paul says, there is
in us neither male nor female.



             REFERENCE TO THE SECOND EPISTLE THE CORINTHIANS.

[Archbishop Wake is the translator of this Second Epistle, which he says
was not of so great reputation among the primitive Fathers as the first.
He defends it notwithstanding; and in answer to those who objected to
Clement's First Epistle, that it did not duly honour the Trinity; the
Archbishop refers to  this as containing proof of the writer's fulness of
belief on that point.]
