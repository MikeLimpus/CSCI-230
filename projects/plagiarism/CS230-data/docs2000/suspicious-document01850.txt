Questions he would suavely and often wittily parry or repel:  to an
unhistorical lady asking if he remembered Madame Du Barry, he said,
"my memory is very imperfect as to the particulars of my life
during the reign of Lous XV. and the Regency; but I know a lady who
has a teapot which belonged, she says, to Madame Du Barry."  BY MYLES
B. FOSTER, Organist of the Foundling Hospital.

In a former number, in prefacing reviews of new music, we said
sufficient upon the subject of listening to music to call the
attention of our many readers to the performances going on so
frequently in all parts of the world, and now we persuade ourselves
that there may be some to whom a short account of the various and
varied forms, to which our attention as audience is most frequently
invited, would be of interest, even though they have some knowledge
of the subject already; and that there may be others to whom these
very incomplete sketches may appear as information, and as an
incentive to further investigation.

For our first sketch we have chosen the oratorio, for it is undoubtedly
the highest form of musical dramatic art, and is founded upon and
contains the greatest and deepest truths of the Christian life. As
regards the actual music forms employed, we find, indeed, similar
ones in the operas, such as the various forms of recitative, the
aria, the duet, and the chorus, and even the scena; but in the
sacred works, who are the heroes and heroines? Are they not the
instruments of the Divine power, the messengers of the good
tidings? And what are the subjects?
Are they not the struggles, the trials, the victories of noble
souls?
With such sacred characters, with such lofty thoughts, the composers
of the oratorio, dealing, not with the semblance of truth that the
opera contains, but with the truth itself, are bound to express
their feelings and emotions in the grandest and most perfect
thoughts.

Purely sentimental ideas, and the whole list of passions and struggles
in human existence, rather form the basis of opera than the proper
subjects for oratorio, and the modern attempts to transform the
sacred ideal into the region of operatic and dramatic realism seem
to fall singularly short of expectation.
Kinglake, who believe R- to be a
gentleman."  In his iciest tones and stoniest manner Kinglake
answered:  "That, Sir, I am quite willing to assume."  The effect,
he used to say, as he told and acted the scene, was magical; "I had
frozen him sober, and we settled everything without a fight."  Of
all his friends Hayward was probably the closest; an association of
discrepancies in character, manner, temperament, not complementary,
but opposed and hostile; irreconcilable, one would say, but for the
knowledge that in love and friendship paradox reigns supreme.
Hayward was arrogant, overbearing, loud, insistent, full of strange
oaths and often unpardonably coarse; "our dominant friend,"
Kinglake called him; "odious" is the epithet I have heard commonly
bestowed upon him by less affectionate acquaintances.  Kinglake was
reserved, shy, reticent, with the high breeding, grand manner,
quiet urbanity, grata protervitas, of a waning epoch; restraint,
concentration, tact of omission, dictating alike his silence and
his speech; his well-weighed words "crystallizing into epigrams as
they touched the air." {26}  When Hayward's last illness came upon
him in 1884, Kinglake nursed him tenderly; spending the morning in
his friend's lodgings at 8, St. James's Street, the house which
Byron occupied in his early London days; and bringing on the latest
bulletin to the club.  The patient rambled towards the end; "we
ought to be getting ready to catch the train that we may go to my
sister's at Lyme." Kinglake quieted his sick friend by an assurance
that the servants, whom he would not wish to hurry, were packing.
"On no account hurry the servants, but still let us be off."  The
last thought which he articulated while dying was, "I don't exactly
know what it is, but I feel it is something grand."  "Hayward is
dead," Kinglake wrote to a common friend; "the devotion shown to
him by all sorts and conditions of men, and, what is better, of
women, was unbounded.  Gladstone found time to be with him, and to
engage him in a conversation of singular interest, of which he has
made a memorandum."

Another of Kinglake's life-long familiars was Charles Skirrow,
Taxing Master in Chancery, with his accomplished wife, from whose
memorable fish dinners at Greenwich he was seldom absent, adapting
himself no less readily to their theatrical friends--the Bancrofts,
Burnand, Toole, Irving--than to the literary set with which he was
more habitually at home.  He was religiously loyal to his friends,
speaking of them with generous admiration, eagerly defending them
when attacked.  He lauded Butler Johnstone as the most gifted of
the young men in the House of Commons; would not allow Bernal
Osborne to be called untrue; "he offends people if you like, but he
is never false or hollow."  A clever sobriquet fathered on him,
burlesquing the monosyllabic names of a well-known diarist and
official, he repelled indignantly.  "He is my friend, and had I
been guilty of the jeu, I should have broken two of my
commandments; that which forbids my joking at a friend's expense,
and that which forbids my fashioning a play upon words."  He
entreated Madame Novikoff to visit and cheer Charles Lever, dying
at Trieste; deeply lamented Sir H. Bulwer's death:  "I used to
think his a beautiful intellect, and he was wonderfully simpatico
to me."  But he was shy of condoling with bereaved mourners,
believing words used on such occasions to be utterly untrue.  He
loved to include husband and wife in the same meed of admiration,
as in the case of Dean Stanley and Lady Augusta, or of Sir Robert
and Lady Emily Peel.  Peel, he said, has the RADIANT quality not
easy to describe; Lady Emily is always beauteous, bright,
attractive.  Lord Stanhope he praised as a historian, paying him
the equivocal compliment that his books were much better than his
conversation.  So, too, he qualified his admiration of Lady
Ashburton, dwelling on her beauty, silver voice, ready enthusiasm
apt to disperse itself by flying at too many objects.

He was wont to speak admiringly of Lord Acton, relating how, a
Roman Catholic, yet respecting enlightenment and devoted to books,
he once set up and edited a "Quarterly Review," with a notion of
reconciling the Light and the Dark as well as he could; but the
"Prince of Darkness, the Pope," interposed, and ordered him to stop
the "Review."  He was compelled to obey; not, he told people, on
any religious ground, but because relations and others would have
made his life a bore to him if he had been contumacious against the
Holy Father.

Kinglake was strongly attracted by W. E. Forster, a "rough
diamond," spoken of at one time as a possible Prime Minister.
Beginning life, he said, as a Quaker, with narrow opinions, his
vigour of character and brain-power shook them off.  Powerful,
robust, and perfectly honest, yet his honesty inflicted on him a
doubleness of view which caused him to be described as engaging his
two hands in two different pursuits.  His estimate of Sir R. Morier
would have gladdened Jowett's heart; he loved him as a private
friend; eulogized his public qualities; rejoiced over his
appointment as Ambassador at St. Petersburg, seeing in him a
diplomatist with not only a keen intellect and large views, but
vibrating with the warmth, animation, friendliness, that are
charmingly un-diplomatic.  Of Carlyle, his life-long, though not
always congenial intimate, he used to speak as having great graphic
power, but being essentially a humourist; a man who, with those he
could trust, never pretended to be in earnest, but used to roar
with glorious laughter over the fun of his own jeremiads; "so far
from being a prophet he is a bad Scotch joker, and knows himself to
be a wind-bag."  He blamed Froude's revelations of Carlyle in "The
Reminiscences," as injurious and offensive.  Froude himself he
often likened to Carlyle; the thoughts of both, he said, ran in the
same direction, but of the two, Froude was by far the more
intellectual man.

Staunch friend to the few, polite, though never effusive, to the
many, he also nourished strong antipathies.  The appearance in
Madame Novikoff's rooms of a certain Scotch bishop invariably drove
him out of them, "Peter Paul, Bishop of Claridge's," he called him.
To Von Beust (the Austrian Chancellor), who spoke English in a
rapid half-intelligible falsetto, he gave the name of Mirliton
(penny trumpet).  His allusions to Mirliton and to the Bishop
frequently mystified Madame Novikoff's guests.  For he loved to
talk in cypher.  Canon Warburton, kindly searching on my behalf his
brother Eliot's journals, tells me that he and Kinglake, meeting
almost daily, lived in a cryptic world of jokes, confidences,
colloquialisms, inexplicable to all but their two selves.

He cordially disliked "The Times" newspaper, alleging instances of
the unfairness with which its columns had been used to spite and
injure persons who had offended it, chuckling over Hayward's
compact anathema,--"'The Times,' which as usual of late supplied
its lack of argument and proof by assumption, misrepresentation,
and personality."  He thought that its attacks upon himself had
helped his popularity.  "One of the main causes," he said in 1875,
"of the interest which people here were good enough to take in my
book was the fight between 'The Times' and me.  In 1863 it raged,
in 1867 it was renewed with great violence, and now I suppose the
flame kindles once more, though probably with diminished strength.
In 1863 the storm of opinion generally waxed fierce against me, but
now, as I hear, 'The Times' is alone, journals of all politics
being loud in my praise.  But I never look at any comment on my
volumes till long afterwards, and I never in my life wrote to a
newspaper."  _Li estis fininta, kiam mia amiko alvenis_, he had
finished (_lit._, was having finished) when my friend arrived.
_Mi estis tuj forironta, kiam vi aperis_, I was just about to go
out when you appeared.
_Li estas nunmomente parolanta_, he is speaking at this very
moment.
_Li estas mortonta_, he is about to die.
_Li estus jam foririnta_, he would have already departed (_lit._,
would be already gone away).

The word _by_ after a Passive is translated by the preposition *de*.

Thus: The wood was being chopped by the boy, _la ligno estis hakata
de la knabo_. He has been seen by all, _li estas vidita de
cxiuj_.

NOTE.--The COMPOUND TENSES should not be used if the SIMPLE TENSES
suffice to show the meaning clearly. Thus, _I have seen him_ is
more neatly expressed by _mi jam vidis lin_ than by _mi estas vidinta
lin_.
_Li jam foriris_ might stand for either _he had gone_ or _he has
gone_, according to circumstances, and the context would
clearly show which was meant. _Li parolas_ is generally quite
right for _he is speaking_. _Li estas parolanta_ should be used
only when it is particularly intended to show that he is _actually
engaged_ in the act of speaking.

The Adverb.

In Esperanto, ADVERBS are denoted by the ending *-e*, and may be
placed in any position, either before or after the verb. Thus:
_bela_, beautiful--_bele_, beautifully; _vera_, true--_vere_,
truly. _Li parolas sagxe_, he speaks wisely. _Li rapide kuras_, he
runs quickly.

Adverbial Numbers.

ADVERBIAL NUMBERS are formed by adding *-e* to the Cardinals.
Thus:

_unue_ (_1e_), firstly; _trie_ (_3e_), thirdly; _sepe_ (_7e_),
etc.

The Preposition.

In English, one preposition often has many different meanings. In
Esperanto, on the contrary, every preposition, with the exception
of the word _je_, has one precise and fixed meaning.

The preposition *je* is the only one in Esperanto without a
definite meaning. It sometimes happens that one wishes to use a
preposition of some sort or other, but is uncertain just which
preposition will precisely express the idea. In such cases _je_ is
used. Thus: He laughed _at_ me, _li ridis je mi_; full _of_ water,
_plena je akvo_; six metres long, _longa je ses metroj_; fear _of_
him, _timo je li_, etc.

_Je_ should not be abused. Its too frequent use is a mark of the
beginner in the language.

Use of Accusative.

When there is no ambiguity to be feared, the preposition _je_, and
even other prepositions, are often omitted in Esperanto; and the
word to which the preposition, if expressed, would have referred
is put into the accusative.

Thus, instead of saying _li ridas je mi_ (he is laughing at me),
one might say _li ridas min_; similarly, _du metrojn alta_ would
stand for _alta je du metroj_. _Gxi kostis je tri sxilingoj_
is more usually expressed: _gxi kostis tri sxilingojn_. _Mi restis
tie dum kvin horoj_ (I stayed there for five hours) could be:
_mi restis tie kvin horojn_; and so on.

Certain prepositions, viz., _antaux_, before, _cxe_, at,
_en_, in, _sub_, under, _sur_, on, _kontraux_, against,
_super_, over, and _trans_, across, are often used to denote _movement
towards_, whereas of themselves they only express _rest at_. In
order to make it quite clear whether motion or rest is intended,
use is made of the accusative.

Thus:
_li promenis en la urbo_, he took a walk _in_ the city; but _li
promenis en la urbon_, he took a walk _into_ the city. _Li kuris
antaux mi_, he ran (along) before or in front of me; but _li pasxis
antaux min_, he stepped in front of me; and so on.
ADVERBS are sometimes used with prepositional force. Thus: _proksime
de la domo_, near the house; _dekstre de la arbo_, on the right of
the tree, etc.

The Conjunction.
A full list of CONJUNCTIONS will be found on §. 37. The following
constructions should be noted:

Tenses after _Ke_ (that).
_Mi vidis, ke sxi ploras_, I saw (that) she was crying.
_Mi sciis, ke li venos_, I knew that he _would_ come.
_Mi sciis, ke li jam alvenis_, I knew (that) he had already
arrived.
_Li diris, ke se li estus tiel granda, kiel mi, li facile farus
tion_, he said that if he were as tall as I, he would easily do
that.
Note that in Esperanto the verb is put in the exact time or tense
used by the speaker. Thus: _mi ne sciis, cxu li venos_, I did not
know whether he would (_lit._, will) come; _ili ne diris, cxu ili
vin renkontis_, they did not say whether they had met you.
Use of Imperative.
After verbs expressing wish, intention, will, or desire, or command,
the verb following is put in the IMPERATIVE MOOD. Thus: _mi ordonas,
ke li venu_, I order that he come (him to come); _mi tre deziris,
ke li vivu_, I very much wanted him to live; _ili intencis, ke ni
perdu_, they intended us to lose. Here the actual expressions used
were: _li venu_, _li vivu_, _ili perdu_.
Use of Conditional after _Se_.
_Se vi tiel diris, vi malprave faris_, if you spoke thus you did
wrongly.
_Se vi tiel dirus, vi estus malprava_, if you said (were to say)
thus, you would be wrong.His

Somersetshire names, Taunton, Wellington, Curry Rivel, Creech,

Who read all the poems of Milton:
And, when she had done,
She said, 'What bad fun!'
This prosaic young lady of Wilton."
