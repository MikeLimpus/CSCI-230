5  But they that are not such,
shall obtain none of those things
which they ask. For they that are
full of faith, ask all things with
confidence, and receive from the
Lord, because they ask without
doubting. But he that doubts,
shall hardly live unto God, except
he repent.

6  Wherefore purify thy heart
from doubting, and put on faith,
and trust in God, and thou shall
receive all that thou shalt ask.
But if thou shouldest chance to
ask something, and not immediately
receive it, yet do not therefore
doubt, because thou hast not
presently received the petition
of thy soul.

7  For it may be thou shalt not
presently receive it for thy trial,
or else for some sin which thou
knowest not. But do not thou
leave off to ask, and then thou
shalt receive. Else if thou shalt
cease to ask, thou must complain
of thyself, and not of God, that he
has not given unto thee what thou
didst desire.

8  Consider therefore this doubting
how cruel and pernicious it is;
and how it utterly roots out many
from the faith, who were very
faithful and firm. For this doubting
is the daughter of the Devil, and
deals very wickedly with the
servants of God.

9  Despise it therefore, and thou
shalt rule over it on every occasion.
Put on a firm and powerful faith:
for faith promises all things
and perfects all things. But
doubting will not believe that it
shall obtain any thing by all that
it can do.

10.  Thou seest therefore, says
he, how faith cometh from above
from God; and hath great power.
But doubting is an earthly spirit,
and proceedeth from the Devil,
and has no strength.

11  Do thou therefore keep the
virtue of faith, and depart from
doubting, in which is no virtue,
and thou shalt live unto God. And
all shall live unto God, as many
as do these things.


COMMAND X.

     Of the sadness of the heart; and that
     we must take, heed not to grieve the
     spirit of God that is in us.

PUT all sadness far from thee;
for it is the sister of doubting
and of anger.  How, sir, said I
is it the sister of these? For
sadness, and anger, and doubting,
seem to me to be very different
from one another.

2  And he answered: Art thou
without sense that thou dost not
understand it? For sadness is the
most mischievous of all spirits,
and the worst to the servants of
God: It destroys the spirits of all
men, and torments the Holy Spirit,
and it saves again.

3  Sir, said I, I am very foolish,
and understand not these things.
I cannot apprehend how it can
torment, and yet save. Hear, said
he, and understand. They who
never sought out the truth, nor
inquired concerning the majesty
of God, but only believed, are
involved in the affairs of the
heathen.

4  And there is another lying
prophet that destroys the minds
of the servants of God; that is
of those that are doubtful, not of
those that fully trust in the Lord.
Now those doubtful persons come
to him, as to a divine spirit, and
inquire of him what shall befall
them.

5  And this lying prophet, having
no power in him of the Divine
Spirit, answers them according to
their demands, and fills their souls
with promises according as they
desire. Howbeit that prophet is
vain, and answers vain things to
those who are themselves vain.

6  And whatsoever is asked of
him by vain men, he answers them
vainly; nevertheless he speaketh
some things truly. For the Devil
fills him with his spirit, that he
may overthrow some of the
righteous.

7  Whosoever therefore are
strong in the faith of the Lord,
and have put on the truth; they
are not joined to such spirits, but
depart from them. But they that
are doubtful, and often repenting,
like the heathens, consult them,
and heap up to themselves great
sin, serving idols.

8  As many therefore as are
such, inquire of them upon every
occasion; worship idols, and are
foolish; and void of the truth.
For every spirit that is given
from God needs not to be asked:
but having the power of divinity
speaks all things of itself,
because he comes from above;
from the power of God.

10  But he, that being asked
speaks according to men's desires
and concerning many other affairs
of this present world, understands
not the tidings which relate unto
God. For these spirits are darkened
through such affairs, and corrupted,
and broken.

11  As good vines if they are
neglected, are oppressed with weeds
and thorns, and at last killed by
them; so are the men who believe
such spirits.

12  They fall into many actions
and businesses, and are void of
sense, and when they think of
things pertaining unto God, they
understand nothing at all; but
at any time they chance to hear
any thing concerning the Lord,
their thoughts are upon their
business.

13  But they that have the fear
of the Lord, and search out the
truth concerning God, having all
their thoughts towards the Lord;
apprehend whatsoever is said to
them, and forthwith understand
it, because they have the fear
of the Lord in them.

14  For where the spirit of the
Lord dwells, there is also much
understanding added. Wherefore
join thyself to the Lord, and thou
shalt understand all things.

15  Learn now, O unwise man!
how sadness troubleth the Holy
Spirit, and how it saves. When
a man that is doubtful is engaged
in any affair, and does not
accomplish it by reason of his
doubting; this sadness enters
into him, and grieves the Holy
Spirit, and makes him sad.

16  Again anger, when it over.
takes any man for any business he
is greatly moved; and then again
sadness entereth into the heart of
him, who was moved with anger,
and he is troubled for what he hath
done, and repenteth, because he
hath done amiss.

17  This sadness therefore seemeth
to bring salvation, because he
repenteth of his evil deed. But
both the other things, namely,
doubting and sadness, such as
before was mentioned, vex the
spirit: doubting, because his
work did not succeed; and sadness,
because he angered the Holy Spirit.

18  Remove therefore sadness
from thyself, and afflict not the
Holy Spirit which dwelleth in
thee, lest he entreat God, and
depart from thee. For the spirit
of the Lord which is given to
dwell in the flesh, endureth no
such sadness.

19  Wherefore clothe thyself
with cheerfulness, which has always
favour with the Lord, and thou shalt
rejoice in it. For every cheerful
man does well; and relishes those
things that are good, and despises
sadness.

20  But the sad man does always
wickedly. First, he doth wickedly,
because he grieveth the Holy Spirit,
which is given to man being of a
cheerful nature. And again he does
ill, because be prays with sadness
unto the Lord, and maketh not first
a thankful acknowledgment unto him
of former mercies, and obtains not
of God what he asks.

21  For the prayer of a sad man
has not always efficacy to come up
to the altar of God. And I said
unto him, Sir, why has not the
prayer of a sad man virtue to come
up to the altar of God?  Because,
said he, that sadness remaineth in
his heart.

22  When therefore a man's
prayer shall be accompanied with
sadness, it will not suffer his
requests to ascend pure to the altar
of God. For as wine when it is
mingled with vinegar, has not the
sweetness it had before; so sadness
being mixed with the Holy Spirit,
suffers not a man's prayer to be
the same as it would be otherwise.

23  Wherefore cleanse thyself
from sadness, which is evil, and
thou shalt live unto God. And all
others shall live unto God, as many
as shall lay aside sadness, and put
on cheerfulness.


COMMAND XI.

     That the spirits and prophets are to be
     tried by their works; and of a twofold, spirit.

HE showed me certain men
sitting upon benches, and
one sitting in a chair: and he said
unto me; Seest thou those who sit
upon the benches? Sir, said I,
I see them. He answered, They
are the faithful; and he who sits
in the chair is an earthly spirit.

2  For he cometh not into the
assembly of the faitful, but avoids
it. But he joins himself to the
doubtful and empty; and prophesies
to them in corners and hidden places;
and pleases them by speaking according
to all the desires of their hearts.

3 For he placing himself among
empty vessels, is not broken, but
the one fitteth the other. But
when he cometh into the company
of just men, who are full of the
spirit of God, and they pray unto
the Lord; that man is emptied,
because that earthly spirit flies
from him, and he is dumb, and
cannot speak anything.

4  As if in a store-house you
shall stop up wine or oil, and
among those vessels place an
empty jar; and when afterwards
you come to open it, you shall
find it empty as you stopped it up;
so those empty prophets when
they come among the spirits of
the just, are found to be such as
they came.

5  I said, How then shall a
man be able to discern them?
Consider what I am going to say
concerning both kinds of men;
and as I speak unto thee so shalt
thou prove the prophet of God,
and the false prophet.

6  And first try the man who
hath the spirit of God, because
the spirit which is from above is
humble, and quiet, and departs
from all wickedness; and from the
vain desires of the present world;
and makes himself more humble
than all men; and answers to none
when he is asked; nor to every
one singly: for the Spirit of God
doth not speak to a man when he
will, but when God pleases.

7  When therefore a man who hath
the Spirit of God hath come into
the church of the righteous, who
have the faith of God, and they
pray unto the Lord; then the holy
angel of God fills that man with
the blessed Spirit, and he speaks
in the congregation as he is moved
of God.

8  Thus therefore is the spirit,
of God known, because whosoever
speaketh by the Spirit of God,
speaketh as the Lord will.

9  Hear now concerning the
earthly spirit, which is empty and
foolish, and without virtue. And
first of all the man who is supposed
to have the Spirit, (whereas he hath
it not in reality), exalteth himself,
and desires to have the first seat,
and is wicked, and full of words.

10  And spends his time in pleasure,
and in all manner of voluptuousness,
and receives the reward of his
divination; which if he receives
not, he does not divine.

11  Should the Spirit of God
receive reward, and divine? It doth
not become a prophet of God so to
do.

12  Thus you seethe life of each
of these kind of prophets. Wherefore
prove that man by his life and works,
who says that he hath the Holy Spirit.
And believe the Spirit which comes
from God, and has power as such.
But believe not the earthly and
empty spirit, which is from the
devil, in whom there is no faith
nor virtue.

13  Hear now the similitude
which I am about to speak unto
thee. Take a stone, and throw it
up towards heaven; or take a
spout of water, and mount it up
thitherward; and see if thou
canst reach unto heaven.

14  Sir; said I, how can this be
done? For neither of those things
which you have mentioned, are
possible to be done. And he
answered, Therefore as these things
cannot be done, so is the earthy
spirit without virtue, and without
effect.

15  Understand yet farther the
power which cometh from above,
in this similitude. The grains of
hail that drop down are exceedingly
small; and yet when they fall upon
the head of a man, how do they
cause pain to it.

16  And again, consider, the
droppings of a house; how the
little drops falling upon the earth,
work a hollow in the stones.

17  So in like manner the least
things which come from above,
and fall upon the earth, have great
force. Wherefore join thyself
to this spirit, which has the
power; and depart from the other
which is empty.


COMMAND XII.

     Of a two fold  desire: that the commands of God,
     are not impossible: and that the devil is not
     to be feared by them that believe.

AGAIN he said unto me;
remove from thee all evil
desires, and put on good and
holy desires. For having put on a
good desire, thou shalt hate that
which is evil, and bridle it as thou
wilt. But an evil desire is dreadful,
and hard to be tamed.

2  It is very horrible and wild;
and by its wildness consumes men.
And especially if a servant of God
shall chance to fall into it, except
he be very wise, he is ruined by
it. For it destroys those who have
not the garment of a good desire
and are engaged in the affairs of
this present world; and delivers
them unto death.

3  Sir, said I, what are the works
of an evil desire, which bring men
unto death? Shew them to me that
I may depart from them. Hear, said he,
by what works an evil desire bringeth
the servants of God unto death.

4  First of all, it is an evil desire
to covet another man's wife, or
for a woman to covet another's
husband; as also to desire the
dainties of riches; and multitude
of superfluous meats; and drunkenness;
and many delights.

5  For in much delicacy there is
folly; and many pleasures are
needless to the servants of God.
Such lusting therefore is evil and
pernicious, which brings to death
the servants of God. For all such
lusting is from the devil.

6 Whosoever therefore shall
depart from all evil desires,
shall live unto God; but they
that are subject unto them shall
die forever. For this evil lusting
is deadly. Do thou therefore put
on the desire of righteousness,
and being armed with the fear of
the Lord resist all wicked lusting.

7 For this fear dwelleth in good
desires; and, when evil coveting
shall see thee armed with the fear
of the Lord, and resisting it; it
will fly far from thee, and not
appear before thee, but be afraid
of thy armour.

8  And thou shall have the victory,
and be crowned for it; and shall
attain to that desire which is
good; and shall give the victory
which thou hast obtained unto
God, and shall serve him in doing
what thou thyself wouldest do.

9  For if thou shalt serve good
desires, and be subject to them;
then thou shalt be able to get the
dominion over thy wicked lustings;
and they will be subject to thee,
as thou wilt.

10  And I said, Sir, I would
know how to serve that desire
which is good? Hearken, said he,
Fear God, and put thy trust in
him, and love truth, and
righteousness, and do that
which is good.

10  If thou shalt do these things,
thou shall be an approved servant
of God, and serve him; and all
others who shall in like manner
serve a good desire, shall live unto
God.

12  And when he had fulfilled
these twelve commands, he said
unto me, Thou hast now these
commands, walk in them; and exhort
those that hear them, to repent,
and that they keep their
repentance pure all the
remaining days of their life.

13  And fulfil diligently this
ministry which I commit to thee,
and thou shalt receive great
advantage by it, and find favour
with all such as shall repent
and believe thy words. For I am
with thee, and will force them
to believe.

14  And I said unto him, Sir,
these commands are great and
excellent, and able to cheer the
heart of that man that shall be
able to keep them. But, Sir,
I cannot tell, whether they can
be observed by any man?

15  He answered, Thou shalt
easily keep these commands, and
they shall not be hard: howbeit,
if thou shalt suffer it once to
enter into thine heart that they
cannot be kept by any one, thou
shalt not fulfil them.

16  But now I say unto thee,
if thou shalt not observe these
commands, and shall neglect them,
thou shalt not be saved, nor thy
children, nor thy house: because
thou hast judged that these
commands cannot be kept by man.

17  These things he spake
very angrily unto me, insomuch
that he greatly affrighted me,
for he changed his countenance
so that a man could not bear his
anger.

18  And when he saw me altogether
troubled and confounded, he began
to speak more moderately and
cheerfully, saying, O foolish,
and without understanding!

19  Unconstant, not knowing
the majesty of God how great and
wonderful he is; who created the
world for man, and hath made
every creature subject unto him;
and given him all power, that he
should be able to fulfil all these
commands.

20  He is able, said he, to fulfil
all these commands, who has the
Lord in his heart; but they who
have the Lord only in their mouths,
their hearts are hardened, and
they are far from the Lord: to
such persons these commands are
hard and difficult.

21 Therefore, ye that are empty
and light in the faith, put the
Lord your God in your hearts;
and ye shall perceive how that
nothing is more easy than these
commands, nor more pleasant, nor
more gentle and holy.

22  And turn yourselves to the
Lord your God, and forsake the
devil and his pleasures, because
they are evil, and bitter, and
impure. And fear not the devil,
because he has no power over you.

23  For I am with you, the
messenger of repentance, who have
the dominion over him. The devil
doth indeed affright men but his
terror is vain. Wherefore fear
him not, and he will flee from you.

24 And I said unto him; Sir,
hear me speak a few words unto
you. He answered, Say on: A
man indeed desires to keep the
commandments of God, and there
is no one but what prays unto God,
that he may be able to keep his
commandments;

25  But the devil is hard, and
by his power rules over the servants
of God. And he said; He cannot
rule over the servants of God,
who trust in him with all their
hearts.

26  The devil may strive, but he
cannot overcome them.

27  For if ye resist him, he will
flee away with confusion from you.
But they that are not full in the
faith, fear the devil, as if he had
some great power. For the devil
tries the servants of God and if he
finds them empty, he destroys
them.

28  For as man, when he fills up
vessels with good wine, and among
them puts a few vessels half full,
and comes to try and taste of the
vessels, doth not try those that are
full, because he knows that they
are good, but tastes those that are
half full, lest they should grow
sour; (for vessels half full soon
grow sour, and lose the taste of
wine:) so the devil comes to the
servants of God to try them.

29  They that are full of faith
resist him stoutly, and he departs
from them, because he finds no
place where to enter into them
then he goes to those that are not
full of faith, and because he has a
place of entrance he goes into
them, and does what he will with
them, and they become his servants.

30  But I, the messenger of
repentance, say unto you, fear not
the devil, for I am sent unto you,
that I may be with you, as many
as shall repent with your whole
heart, and that I may confirm you
in the faith.

31  Believe therefore, ye who
by reason of your transgressions
have forgot God. and your own
salvation; and adding to your
sins have made your life very
heavy.

32  That if ye shall turn to the
Lord with your whole hearts, and
shall serve him according to his
will; he will heal you of your
former sins, and ye shall have
dominion over all the works of the
devil.

33  Be not then afraid in the
least of his threatenings, for they
are without force, as the nerves of
a dead man. But hearken unto
me, and fear the Lord Almighty,
who is able to save and to destroy
you; and keep his commands, that
ye may live unto God.

34  And I said unto him; Sir,
I am now confirmed in all the
commands of the Lord whilst you
are with me, and I know that you
will break all the powers of the
devil.

35  And we also shall overcome
him, if we shall be able, through
the help of the Lord, to keep these
commands which you have delivered.

36  Thou shalt keep them, said
he, if thou shalt purify thy heart
towards the Lord. And all they
also shall keep them who shall
cleanse their hearts from the vain
desires of the present world, and
shall live unto God.


                         THE THIRD PART OF THE
                BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS SIMILITUDES.


SIMILITUDE I.

     That seeing we have no abiding city in this world,
     we ought to look after that which is to come.

AND he said onto me; Ye know
that ye who are the servants
of the Lord, live here as in
a pilgrimage; for your city
is far off from this city.

2  If, therefore, ye know your
city in which ye are to dwell,
why do ye here buy estates, and
provide yourselves with delicacies,
and stately buildings, and
supurfluous houses? For he that
provides himself these things
in this city, does not think
of returning into his own city.

3 O foolish, and doubtful, and
wretched man; who understandest
not that all these things belong
to other men, and are under the
power of another. For the Lord
of this city saith unto thee;
Either obey my laws, or depart
out of my city.

4  What therefore shalt thou do
who art subject to a law in thine
own city? Canst thou for thy
estate, or for any of those things
which thou hast provided, deny
thy law? But if thou shalt deny
it, and wilt afterwards return into
thy own city, thou shalt not be
received, but shall be excluded
thence.

5  See therefore, that like a man
in another country, thou procure
no more to thyself than what is
necessary, and sufficient for thee;
and be ready, that when the God
or Lord of this city shall drive
thee out of it thou mayest oppose
his law, and go into thine own
city; where thou mayest with all
cheerfulness live according to
thine own law with no wrong.

6  Take heed therefore ye that
serve God, and have him in your
hearts: work ye the works of
God, being mindful both of his
commands and of his promises,
which he has promised; and be
assured that he will make them
good unto you; if ye shall keep
his commandments.

7  Instead therefore of the
possessions that ye would otherwise
purchase, redeem those that are
in want from their necessities,
as every one is able; justify the
widows; judge the cause of the
fatherless; and spend your riches
and your wealth in such works as
these.

8  For this end has God enriched
you, that ye might fulfil these
kind of services. It is much
better to do this, than to buy lands
or houses; because all such things
shall perish with this present time.

9  But what ye shall do for the
name of the Lord, ye shall find
in your city, and shall have joy
without sadness or fear. Wherefore
covet not the riches of the heathen;
for they are destructive to the
servants of God.

10  But trade with your own riches
which you possess, by which ye may
attain unto everlasting joy.

11  And do not commit adultery,
nor touch any other man's wife,
nor desire her; but covet that
which is thy own business, and
thou shalt be saved.


SIMILITUDE II.

     As the vine is supported by the elm,
     so is the rich man helped by the prayers of the poor.

AS I was walking into the field,
and considered the elm and
the vine, and thought with myself
of their fruits, an angel appeared
unto me, and said unto me; What
is it that thou thinkest upon thus
long within thyself?

2  And I said unto him, Sir, I
think of this vine and this elm
because their fruits are fair.
And he said unto me; These two
trees are set for a pattern to
the servants of God.

3  And I said unto him, Sir, I
would know in what the pattern
of these trees which thou mentionest,
does consist. Hearken, saith he;
seest thou this vine and this
elm? Sir, said I, I see them.
