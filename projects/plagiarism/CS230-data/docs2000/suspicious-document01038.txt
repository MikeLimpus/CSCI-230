003:019 But Herod the Tetrarch, being repeatedly rebuked by him about
        Herodias his brother's wife, and about all the wicked deeds
        that he had done,
003:020 now added this to crown all the rest, that he threw
        John into prison.
003:021 Now when all the people had been baptized, and Jesus also had
        been baptized and was praying, the sky opened,
003:022 and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily shape, like a dove,
        upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven, which said, "Thou art
        My Son, dearly loved:  in Thee is My delight."
003:023 And He--Jesus--when He began His ministry, was about thirty
        years old.  He was the son (it was supposed) of Joseph,
        son of Heli,
003:024 son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai,
        son of Joseph,
003:025 son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli,
        son of Naggai,
003:026 son of Mahath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech,
        son of Joda,
003:027 son of Johanan, son of Resa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel,
        son of Neri,
003:028 son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam,
        son of Er,
003:029 son of Joshua, son of Eliezar, son of Jorim, son of Maththat,
        son of Levi,
003:030 son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam,
        son of Eliakim, son of
003:031 Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan,
        son of David,
003:032 son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon,
        son of Nahshon,
003:033 son of Amminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron,
        son of Perez, son of Judah,
003:034 son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah,
        son of Nahor,
003:035 son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber,
        son of Shelah,
003:036 son of Cainan, son of Arpachshad, son of Shem, son of Noah,
        son of Lamech,
003:037 son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel,
        son of Kenan,
003:038 son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.
004:001 Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan,
        and was led about by the Spirit in the Desert for forty days,
004:002 tempted all the while by the Devil.  During those days He
        ate nothing, and at the close of them He suffered from hunger.
004:003 Then the Devil said to Him, "If you are God's Son, tell this
        stone to become bread."
004:004 "It is written," replied Jesus, "`It is not on bread alone
        that a man shall live.'"
004:005 The Devil next led Him up and caused Him to see at a glance
        all the kingdoms of the world.
004:006 And the Devil said to Him, "To you will I give all this authority
        and this splendour; for it has been handed over to me,
        and on whomsoever I will I bestow it.
004:007 If therefore you do homage to me, it shall all be yours.'
004:008 Jesus answered him, "It is written, `To the Lord thy God thou
        shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'"
004:009 Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and caused Him to stand on
        the roof of the Temple, and said to Him, "If you are God's Son,
        throw yourself down from here; for it is written,
004:010 `He will give orders to His angels concerning thee,
        to guard thee safely;'
004:011 and `On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest at any moment
        thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'"
004:012 The reply of Jesus was, "It is said, `Thou shalt not put
        the Lord they God to the proof.'"
004:013 So the Devil, having fully tried every kind of temptation on Him,
        left Him for a time.
004:014 Then Jesus returned in the Spirit's power to Galilee;
        and His fame spread through all the adjacent districts.
004:015 And He proceeded to teach in their synagogues, winning
        praise from all.
004:016 He came to Nazareth also, where He had been brought up;
        and, as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath,
        and stood up to read.
004:017 And there was handed to Him the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and,
        opening the book, He found the place where it was written,
004:018 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me
        to proclaim Good News to the poor; He has sent me to announce
        release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind:
        to send away free those whom tyranny has crushed,
004:019 to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord."
004:020 And rolling up the book, He returned it to the attendant,
        and sat down--to speak.  Several of them were swimming in the
        water, and one or
two were on the bank. One of these had a sort of frame around its
        neck, and was standing on
one leg.
        
        Maud said, "Why, see that poor goose! It has only one leg; and they
have put that frame on so it can walk better."004:023 "Doubtless," said He, "you will quote to me the proverb,
        `Physician, cure yourself:  all that we hear that you have
        done at Capernaum, do here also in your native place.'"
004:024 "I tell you in solemn truth," He added, "that no Prophet
        is welcomed among his own people.
004:025 But I tell you in truth that there was many a widow in Israel
        in the time of Elijah, when there was no rain for three years
        and six months and there came a severe famine over all the land;
004:026 and yet to not one of them was Elijah sent:  he was only sent
        to a widow at Zarephath in the Sidonian country.
004:027 And there was also many a leper in Israel in the time of
        the Prophet Elisha, and yet not one of them was cleansed,
        but Naaman the Syrian was."
004:028 Then all in the synagogue, while listening to these words,
        were filled with fury.
004:029 They rose, hurried Him outside the town, and brought Him
        to the brow of the hill on which their town was built,
        to throw Him down the cliff;
004:030 but He passed through the midst of them and went His way.
004:031 So He came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, where He
        frequently taught the people on the Sabbath days.
004:032 And they were greatly impressed by His teaching, because He
        spoke with the language of authority.
004:033 But in the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit
        of a foul demon.  [Illustration]
At last the little robin was so tired and frightened, that it
        lay on the ground, panting, with its
feathers ruffled, and its beak wide open, and its eyes half
        closed. It seemed ready to die. Then the rude, cruel boys pulled
the string to make it fly again.Upon this, the demon hurled the man
        into the midst of them, and came out of him without doing
        him any harm.
004:036 All were astonished and awe-struck; and they asked one another,
        "What sort of language is this?  For with authority and real
        power He gives orders to the foul spirits and they come out."
004:037 And the talk about Him spread into every part of
        the neighbouring country.
004:038 Now when He rose and left the synagogue He went to Simon's house.
        Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from an acute attack of fever;
        and they consulted Him about her.
004:039 Then standing over her He rebuked the fever, and it left her;
        and she at once rose and waited on them.
004:040 At sunset all who had friends suffering from any illness brought
        them to Him, and He laid His hands on them all, one by one,
        and cured them.
004:041 Demons also came out of many, loudly calling out, "You are
        the Son of God."  But He rebuked them and forbad them to speak,
        because they knew Him to be the Christ.
004:042 Next morning, at daybreak, He left the town and went away
        to a solitary place; but the people flocked out to find Him,
        and, coming to the place where He was, they endeavoured
        to detain Him that He might not leave them.
004:043 But He said to them, "I have to tell the Good News of the Kingdom
        of God to the other towns also, because for this purpose
        I was sent."
004:044 And for some time He preached in the synagogues in Galilee.
005:001 On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to
        God's Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.
005:002 He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach
        (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets),
005:003 and going on board one of them, which was Simon's He asked him
        to push out a little from land.  Then He sat down and taught
        the crowd of people from the boat.
005:004 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Push out
        into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul."
005:005 "Rabbi," replied Peter, "all night long we have worked
        hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let
        down the nets."
005:006 This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their
        nets began to break.
005:007 So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come
        and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats
        so that they almost sank.
005:008 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus,
        and exclaimed, "Master, leave my boat, for I am a sinful man."
005:009 (For he was astonished and terrified--he and all his companions--
        at the haul of fish which they had taken;
005:010 and so were Simon's partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.)
        But Jesus replied to Simon, "Fear not:  from this time you
        shall be a catcher of men."
005:011 Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything
        and followed Him.
005:012 On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns,
        there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus,
        threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, "Sir,
        if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean."
005:013 Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, "I am willing;
        be cleansed!"  And instantly the leprosy left him.
005:014 He ordered him to tell no one.  "But go," He said, "show yourself
        to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification
        which Moses appointed, as evidence for them."
005:015 But all the more the report about Him spread abroad,
        and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured
        of their diseases;
005:016 but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert
        and there prayed.
005:017 One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees
        and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from
        every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem.
        And the power of the Lord was present for Him to cure people.
005:018 And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed,
        and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.
005:019 But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd,
        they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling--
        bed and all--into the midst, in front of Jesus.
005:020 He saw their faith and said to him, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
005:021 Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, "Who is this,
        uttering blasphemies?  Who but God alone can forgive sins?"
005:022 Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions
        by asking in turn, "What is this that you are debating
        in your hearts?
005:023 Which is easier?--to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,
        `Rise and walk'?
005:024 But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on
        earth to forgive sins"--Turning to the paralytic He said,
        "I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home."
005:025 Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress
        on which he had been lying, and went away to his home,
        giving glory to God.
005:026 Amazement seized them all.  "Glory to God!" was the abiding feeling.
        Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, "We have
        seen strange things to-day."
005:027 After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name,
        sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, "Follow me."
005:028 He rose, left everything, and followed Him.
005:029 Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour
        of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers
        and others at table with them.
005:030 This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate
        with His disciples and ask, "Why are you eating and drinking
        with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?"
005:031 But Jesus replied to them, "It is not men in good health
        who require a physician, but the sick.
005:032 I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners."
005:033 Again they said to Him, "John's disciples fast often and pray,
        as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink."
005:034 "Can you compel the bridal party to fast," replied Jesus,
        "so long as they have the bridegroom among them?
005:035 But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been
        taken away from them:  then, at that time, they will fast."
005:036 He also spoke in figurative language to them.  "No one,"
        He said, "tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one.
        Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch
        from the new would not match the old.
005:037 Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Bella loved
        Peepy, and would fly about the room, and light on her head,
        and play with her curls.

But as summer came on, and the weather grew warm and pleasant,
        Peepy thought to herself, "Bella
loves me, and is grateful for all my care; but liberty is as sweet
        to birds as to little girls. I will not selfishly keep
        this bird in prison. I will take it into the
grove, and set it free."
        [Illustration]
So Peepy took it into the grove, and set it free; and Bella lighted
on a bough, and sang the sweetest song you ever heard.006:003 "Have you never read so much as this," answered Jesus--"what David
        did when he and his followers were hungry;
006:004 how he entered the house of God and took and ate the Presented Loaves
        and gave some to his followers--loaves which none but the Priests
        are allowed to eat?"
006:005 "The Son of Man," He added, "is Lord of the Sabbath also."
006:006 On another Sabbath He had gone to the synagogue and was
        teaching there; and in the congregation was a man whose
        right arm was withered.
006:007 The Scribes and the Pharisees were on the watch to see whether
        He would cure him on the Sabbath that they might be able
        to bring an accusation against Him.
006:008 He knew their thoughts, and said to the man with the
        withered arm, "Rise, and stand there in the middle."
        And he rose and stood there.
006:009 Then Jesus said to them, "I put it to you all whether we
        are allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil;
        to save a life, or to destroy it."
006:010 And looking round upon them all He said to the man, "Stretch out
        your arm."  He did so, and the arm was restored.
006:011 But they were filled with madness, and began to discuss
        with one another what they should do to Jesus.
006:012 About that time He went out on one occasion into the hill
        country to pray; and He remained all night in prayer to God.
006:013 When it was day, He called His disciples; and He selected
        from among them twelve, whom He also named Apostles.
006:014 These were Simon, to whom also He had given the name of Peter,
        and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
006:015 Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon
        called the Zealot;
006:016 James's relative Judas, and Judas Iscariot who proved to
        be a traitor.
006:017 With these He came down till He reached a level place,
        where there was a great crowd of His disciples, and a multitude
        of people from every part of Judaea, from Jerusalem,
        and from the sea-side district of Tyre and Sidon, who came
        to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;
006:018 and those who were tormented by foul spirits were cured.
006:019 The whole crowd were eager to touch Him, because power went
        forth from him and cured every one.
006:020 Then fixing His eyes upon His disciples, Jesus said to them,
        "Blessed are you poor, because the Kingdom of God is yours.
006:021 "Blessed are you who hunger now, because your hunger shall
        be satisfied.  "Blessed are you who now weep aloud,
        because you shall laugh.
006:022 "Blessed are you when men shall hate you and exclude you
        from their society and insult you, and spurn your very names
        as evil things, for the Son of Man's sake.
006:023 "Be glad at such a time, and dance for joy; for your reward
        is great in Heaven; for that is just the way their forefathers
        behaved to the Prophets!
006:024 "But alas for you rich men, because you already
        have your consolation!
006:025 "Alas for you who now have plenty to eat, because you will be hungry!
        "Alas for you who laugh now, because you will mourn
        and weep aloud!
006:026 "Alas for you when men shall all have spoken well of you;
        for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to
        the false Prophets!
006:027 "But to you who are listening to me I say, Love your enemies;
        seek the welfare of those who hate you;
006:028 bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.
006:029 To him who gives you a blow on one side of the face offer
        the other side also; and to him who is robbing you of your
        outer garment refuse not the under one also.
006:030 To every one who asks, give; and from him who takes away
        your property, do not demand it back.
006:031 And behave to your fellow men just as you would have them
        behave to you.
006:032 "If you love those who love you, what credit is it to you?
        Why, even bad men love those who love them.
006:033 And if you are kind to those who are kind to you, what credit
        is it to you?  Even bad men act thus.
006:034 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive,
        what credit is it to you?  Even bad men lend to their fellows
        so as to receive back an equal amount.
006:035 Nevertheless love your enemies, be beneficent; and lend
        without hoping for any repayment.  Then your recompense
        shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High;
        for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
006:036 Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate.
006:037 "Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you
        shall not be condemned; pardon, and you shall be pardoned;
006:038 give, and gifts shall be bestowed on you.  Full measure, pressed,
        shaken down, and running over, shall they pour into your laps;
        for with the same measure that you use they shall measure
        to you in return."
006:039 He also spoke to them in figurative language.  "Can a blind
        man lead a blind man?"  He asked; "would not both fall
        into the ditch?
006:040 There is no disciple who is superior to his teacher; but every
        one whose instruction is complete will be like his teacher.
006:041 "And why look at the splinter in your brother's eye instead
        of giving careful attention to the beam in your own?
006:042 How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take that
        splinter out of your eye,' when all the while you yourself
        do not see the beam in your own eye?  Vain pretender! take
        the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see
        clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.
006:043 "There is no good tree that yields unsound fruit, nor again
        any unsound tree that yields good fruit.
006:044 Every tree is known by its own fruit.  It is not from thorns
        that men gather figs, nor from the bramble that they can get
        a bunch of grapes.
006:045 A good man from the good stored up in his heart brings
        out what is good; and an evil man from the evil stored up
        brings out what is evil; for from the overflow of his heart
        his mouth speaks.
006:046 "And why do you all call me `Master, Master' and yet not do
        what I tell you?
006:047 Every one who comes to me and listens to my words and puts
        them in practice, I will show you whom he is like.
006:048 He is like a man building a house, who digs and goes deep,
        and lays the foundation on the rock; and when a flood comes,
        the torrent bursts upon that house, but is unable to shake it,
        because it is securely built.
006:049 But he who has heard and not practised is like a man who has
        built a house upon the soft soil without a foundation,
        against which the torrent bursts, and immediately it collapses,
        and terrible is the wreck and ruin of that house."
007:001 After He had finished teaching all these things in the hearing
        of the people, He went into Capernaum.
007:002 Here the servant of a certain Captain, a man dear to his master,
        was ill and at the point of death;
007:003 and the Captain, hearing about Jesus, sent to Him some
        of the Jewish Elders, begging Him to come and restore his
        servant to health.
007:004 And they, when they came to Jesus, earnestly entreated Him,
        pleading, "He deserves to have this favour granted him,
007:005 for he loves our nation, and at his own expense he built our
        synagogue for us."
007:006 Then Jesus went with them.  Mamie is thirteen, but is more
        afraid to ride than Winnie, who is only seven. Mamie asks if
        boys always ride better than girls. I say, "No!
        Look at Winnie." Once
we tied Duke to the swing; and then he got his nose pulled by
getting the rope twisted round it.Only speak the word, and let my young man be cured.
007:008 For I too am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers
        under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; to another,
        `Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, `Do this or that,'
        and he does it."
007:009 Jesus listened to the Captain's message and was astonished at him,
        and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him, "I tell
        you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that."
007:010 And the friends who had been sent, on returning to the house,
        found the servant in perfect health.
007:011 Shortly afterwards He went to a town called Nain, attended by His
        disciples and a great crowd of people.
007:012 And just as He reached the gate of the town, they happened to be
        bringing out for burial a dead man who was his mother's only son;
        and she was a widow; and a great number of the townspeople
        were with her.
007:013 The Lord saw her, was moved with pity for her, and said to her,
        "Do not weep."
007:014 Then He went close and touched the bier, and the bearers halted.
        "Young man," He said, "I command you, wake!"
007:015 The dead man sat up and began to speak; and He restored him
        to his mother.
007:016 All were awe-struck, and they gave glory to God--some saying,
        "A Prophet, a great Prophet, has risen up among us."
        Others said, "God has not forgotten His People."
007:017 And the report of what Jesus had done spread through the whole
        of Judaea and in all the surrounding districts.
007:018 John's disciples brought him an account of all these things;
007:019 so John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord.
        "Are you the Coming One?" he asked, "or is there another
        that we are to expect?"
007:020 The men came to Jesus and said, "John the Baptist has sent
        us to you with this question:  `Are you the Coming One,
        or is there another that we are to expect?'"
007:021 He immediately cured many of diseases, severe pain, and evil spirits,
        and to many who were blind He gave the gift of sight.
007:022 Then He answered the messengers, "Go and report to John what you
        have seen and heard.  Blind men receive sight, the lame walk,
        lepers are purified, deaf persons hear, the dead are raised
        to life, the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them.
007:023 And blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because
        of my claims."
007:024 When John's messengers were gone, He proceeded to say to the multitude
        concerning John, "What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at?
        A reed waving in the wind?
007:025 But what did you go out to see?  A man wearing luxurious clothes?
        People who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are
        found in palaces.
007:026 But what did you go out to see?  A Prophet?  Aye, I tell you,
        and far more than a Prophet.
007:027 John is the man about whom it is written, `See, I am sending
        My messenger before thy face, and he shall make ready thy
        way before thee.'
007:028 "I tell you that among all of women born there is not one greater
        than John.  Yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of God
        is greater than he.
007:029 And all the people, including the tax-gatherers, when they
        listened to him upheld the righteousness of God, by being
        baptized with John's baptism.
007:030 But the Pharisees and expounders of the Law have frustrated God's
        purpose as to their own lives, by refusing to be baptized.
007:031 "To what then shall I compare the men of the present generation,
        and what do they resemble?
007:032 They are like children sitting in the public square and calling
        out to one another, `We have played the flute to you,
        and you have not danced:  we have sung dirges, and you have
        not shown sorrow.'
007:033 For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking
        no wine, and you say, `He has a demon!'
007:034 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say,
        `Look, there is a man who is overfond of eating and drinking--
        he is a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'
007:035 But wisdom is justified by all who are truly wise."
007:036 Now one of the Pharisees repeatedly invited Him to a meal at
        his house; so He entered the house and reclined at the table.
007:037 And there was a woman in the town who was a notorious sinner.
        Having learnt that Jesus was at table in the Pharisee's house
        she brought a flask of perfume,
007:038 and, standing behind close to His feet, weeping, began to wet
        His feet with her tears; and with her hair she wiped the tears
        away again, while she lovingly kissed His feet and poured
        the perfume over them.
007:039 Noticing this, the Pharisee, His host, said to himself,
        "This man, if he were really a Prophet, would know who and
        what sort of person this woman is who is touching him--
        and would know that she is an immoral woman."
007:040 In answer to his thoughts Jesus said to him, "Simon, I have
        a word to say to you."  "Rabbi, say on," he replied.
007:041 "There were once two men in debt to one money-lender," said Jesus;
        "one owed him five hundred shillings and the other fifty.
007:042 But neither of them could pay anything; so he freely forgave
        them both.  Tell me, then, which of them will love him most?"
007:043 "I suppose," replied Simon, "the one to whom he forgave most."
        "You have judged rightly," Jesus rejoined.
007:044 Then turning towards the woman He said to Simon, "Do you see
        this woman?  I came into your house:  you gave me no water
        for my feet; but she has made my feet wet with her tears,
        and then wiped the tears away with her hair.
007:045 No kiss did you give me; but she from the moment I came in has
        not left off tenderly kissing my feet.
007:046 No oil did you pour even on my head; but she has poured perfume
        upon my feet.
007:047 This is the reason why I tell you that her sins, her many sins,
        are forgiven--because she has loved much; but he who is
        forgiven little, loves little."
007:048 And He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
007:049 Then the other guests began to say to themselves, "Who can
        this man be who even forgives sins?"
007:050 But He said to the woman, "Your faith has cured you:
        go, and be at peace."
008:001 Shortly after this He visited town after town, and village
        after village, proclaiming His Message and telling the Good News
        of the Kingdom of God.  The Twelve were with Him,
008:002 and certain women whom He had delivered from evil spirits
        and various diseases--Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven
        demons had come,
008:003 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna,
        and many other women, all of whom contributed to the support
        of Jesus and His Apostles.
008:004 And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions
        from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.
008:005 "The sower," He said, "goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows,
        some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon,
        or the birds of the air come and peck it up.
008:006 Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it
        withers away for want of moisture.
008:007 Another part falls among the thorns, and the thorns grow up
        with it and stifle it.
008:008 But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and
        yields a return of a hundred for one."  While thus speaking,
        He cried aloud and said, "Listen, every one who has ears
        to listen with!"
008:009 The disciples proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.
008:010 "To you," He replied, "it is granted to know the secrets
        of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables,
        in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear
        and yet not understand.
008:011 The meaning of the parable is as follows.  The seed
        is God's Message.
008:012 Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then
        the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts,
        lest they should believe and be saved.
008:013 Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive
        it joyfully; but they have no root:  for a time they believe,
        but when trial comes they fall away.
008:014 That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard,
        but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by
        the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield
        nothing in perfection.
008:015 But as for that in the good ground, it means those who,
        having listened to the Message with open minds and in a
        right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.
008:016 "When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a
        vessel or hide it under a couch; he puts it on a lampstand,
        that people who enter the room may see the light.
008:017 There is nothing hidden, which shall not be openly seen;
        nor anything secret, which shall not be known and come into
        the light of day.
008:018 Be careful, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has anything,
        to him more shall be given, and whoever has nothing,
        even that which he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."
008:019 Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get
        near Him for the crowd.
008:020 But He was told, "Your mother and brothers are standing on
        the edge of the crowd, and want to see you."
008:021 "My mother and my brothers," He replied, "are these who hear
        God's Message and obey it."
008:022 One day He went on board a boat--both He and his disciples; and He
        said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the Lake."
        So they set sail.
002:023 During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall
        of wind on the Lake, so that the boat began to fill and they
        were in deadly peril.
008:024 So they came and woke Him, crying, "Rabbi, Rabbi, we are drowning."
        Then He roused Himself and rebuked the wind and the surging
        of the water, and they ceased and there was a calm.
008:025 "Where is your faith?"  He asked them.  But they were filled
        with terror and amazement, and said to one another,
        "Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves,
        and they obey Him."
008:026 Then they put in to shore in the country of the Gerasenes,
        which lies opposite to Galilee.
008:027 Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was
        possessed by demons--for a long time he had not put on any garment,
        nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.
008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him,
        and said in a loud voice, "What have you to do with me,
        Jesus, Son of God Most High?  Do not torture me, I beseech you."
008:029 For already He had been commanding the foul spirit to come
        out of the man.  For many a time it had seized and held him,
        and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept
        guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces,
        and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.
008:030 "What is your name?"  Jesus asked him.  "Legion," he replied--
        because a great number of demons had entered into him;
008:031 and they besought Him not to command them to be gone into
        the Bottomless Pit.
008:032 Now there was a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side;
        and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them,
        and He gave them leave.
008:033 The demons came out of the man and left him, and entered
        into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff
        into the Lake and were drowned.
008:034 The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported
        it both in town and country;
008:035 whereupon the people came out to see what had happened.
        They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons
        had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his
        right mind; and they were terrified.
008:036 And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.
008:037 Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent
        districts begged Him to depart from them; for their terror
        was great.  So He went on board and returned.
008:038 But the man from whom the demons had gone out earnestly asked
        permission to go with Him; but He sent him away.
008:039 "Return home," He said, "and tell there all that God has done
        for you."  So he went and published through the whole town
        all that Jesus had done for him.
008:040 Now when Jesus was returning, the people gave Him a warm welcome;
        for they had all been looking out for Him.
008:041 Just then there came a man named Jair, a Warden of the Synagogue,
        who threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and entreated Him
        to come to his house;
008:042 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she
        was dying.  And as He went, the dense throng crowded on Him.
008:043 And a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage--
        and had spent on doctors all she had, but none of them had
        been able to cure her--
008:044 came close behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe;
        and instantly her flow of blood stopped.
008:045 "Who is it touched me?"  Jesus asked.  And when all denied
        having done so, Peter and the rest said, "Rabbi, the crowds
        are hemming you in and pressing on you."
008:046 "Some one has touched me," Jesus replied, "for I feel that power
        has gone out from me."
008:047 Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice,
        came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she
        stated before all the people the reason why she had touched
        Him and how she was instantly cured.
008:048 "Daughter," said He, "your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace."
008:049 While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of
        the Synagogue from his house and said, "Your daughter is dead;
        trouble the Rabbi no further."
008:050 Jesus heard the words and said to him, "Have no fear.
        Only believe, and she shall be restored to life."
008:051 So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him
        but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.
008:052 The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her;
        but He said, "Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."
008:053 And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.
008:054 He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, "Child, awake!"
Duke seems to love the bold Winnie, and will do whatever she
        tells him to.

NELLY'S KITTEN.
        
        
NELLY'S kitten was the handsomest kitten that ever was. So her
        little mistress
thought. Nelly made a great pet of her, and brought her up with great care;
        and, when she had become a well-grown cat, Nelly gave her the
name of "Pussy Gray."
        One morning while Nelly was being dressed, her sister told
her there was something nice down stairs, and asked her to guess
        what it was. "I guess it's pickled limes," said Nelly;
        for she dearly loved pickled
limes. But her sister said "No."--"Then I guess it's kittens," said
        Nelly; and so it was.
Out in the back-room, in a barrel of shavings, were two little
bunches of fur; and, when Nelly took them out and put them on the
floor, they looked as though they were all legs and mouths. Their
eyes were shut tight, and their little pink mouths were wide
open.
But, in a week or two, the eyes came open, and the little kitties
saw their feet and tails for the first time. Then they stood upon
their feet, and played with their tails till they found their mother
had one that was bigger and longer; and then they played with their
mother's tail whenever she forgot to tuck it away and put her paw
on it.
The kittens were always in somebody's way. When Nelly's mamma sat
down in the big rocking-chair for a little rest, the first time she
rocked back, "Mew, mew, mew!".
