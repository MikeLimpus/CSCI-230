010:037 Any one who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy
        of me, and any one who loves son or daughter more than me
        is not worthy of me;
010:038 and any one who does not take up his cross and follow where I
        lead is not worthy of me.
010:039 To save your life is to lose it, and to lose your life for my
        sake is to save it.
010:040 "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me
        receives Him who sent me.
010:041 Every one who receives a prophet, because he is a prophet,
        will receive a prophet's reward, and every one who receives
        a righteous man, because he is a righteous man, will receive
        a righteous man's reward.
010:042 And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold
        water to drink because he is a disciple, I solemnly tell you
        that he will not lose his reward."
011:001 When Jesus had concluded His instructions to His twelve disciples,
        He left in order to teach and to proclaim His Message
        in the neighbouring towns.
011:002 Now John had heard in prison about the Christ's doings,
        and he sent some of his disciples to inquire:
011:003 "Are you the Coming One, or is it a different person that we
        are to expect?"
011:004 "Go and report to John what you see and hear," replied Jesus;
011:005 "blind eyes receive sight, and cripples walk; lepers are cleansed,
        and deaf ears hear; the dead are raised to life, and the poor
        have the Good News proclaimed to them;
011:006 and blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because
        of my claims."
011:007 When the messengers had taken their leave, Jesus proceeded
        to say to the multitude concerning John, "What did you go
        out into the Desert to gaze at?  A reed waving in the wind?
011:008 But what did you go out to see?  A man luxuriously dressed?
        Those who wear luxurious clothes are to be found in kings' palaces.
011:009 But why did you go out?  To see a prophet?  Yes, I tell you,
        and far more than a prophet.
011:010 This is he of whom it is written, "`See I am sending My messenger
        before Thy face, and he will make Thy road ready before Thee.'
011:011 "I solemnly tell you that among all of woman born no
        greater has ever been raised up than John the Baptist;
        yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of the Heavens
        is greater than he.
011:012 But from the time of John the Baptist till now, the Kingdom
        of the Heavens has been suffering violent assault,
        and the violent have been seizing it by force.
011:013 For all the Prophets and the Law taught until John.
011:014 And (if you are willing to receive it) he is the Elijah
        who was to come.
011:015 Listen, every one who has ears!
011:016 "But to what shall I compare the present generation?
        It is like children sitting in the open places, who call
        to their playmates.
011:017 "`We have played the flute to you,' they say, `and you
        have not danced:  we have sung dirges, and you have not
        beaten your breasts.'
011:018 "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,
        `He has a demon.'
011:019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they exclaim,
        `See this man!--given to gluttony and tippling,
        and a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'
        And yet Wisdom is vindicated by her actions."
011:020 Then began He to upbraid the towns where most of His mighty
        works had been done--because they had not repented.
011:021 "Alas for thee, Chorazin!"  He cried.  "Alas for
        thee, Bethsaida!  For had the mighty works been done in Tyre
        and Sidon which have been done in both of you, they would long
        ere now have repented, covered with sackcloth and ashes.
011:022 Only I tell you that it will be more endurable for Tyre
        and Sidon on the day of Judgement than for you.
011:023 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted even to Heaven?  Even to
        Hades shalt thou descend.  For had the mighty works been
        done in Sodom which have been done in thee, it would have
        remained until now.
011:024 Only I tell you all, that it will be more endurable for the land
        of Sodom on the day of Judgement than for thee."
011:025 About that time Jesus exclaimed, "I heartily praise
        Thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and of earth, that Thou hast
        hidden these things from sages and men of discernment,
        and hast unveiled them to babes.
011:026 Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.
011:027 "All things have been handed over to me by my Father,
        and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does
        any one fully know the Father except the Son and all to whom
        the Son chooses to reveal Him.
011:028 "Come to me, all you toiling and burdened ones, and *I* will
        give you rest.
011:029 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for I am gentle
        and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
011:030 For it is good to bear my yoke, and my burden is light."
012:001 About that time Jesus passed on the Sabbath through the wheatfields;
        and His disciples became hungry, and began to gather ears
        of wheat and eat them.
012:002 But the Pharisees saw it and said to Him, "Look! your disciples
        are doing what the Law forbids them to do on the Sabbath."
012:003 "Have you never read," He replied, "what David did when he and
        his men were hungry?
012:004 how he entered the House of God and ate the Presented Loaves,
        which it was not lawful for him or his men to eat, nor for any
        except the priests?
012:005 And have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests
        in the Temple break the Sabbath without incurring guilt?
012:006 But I tell you that there is here that which is greater
        than the Temple.
012:007 And if you knew what this means, `It is mercy I desire,
        not sacrifice', you would not have condemned those who
        are without guilt.
012:008 For the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath."
012:009 Departing thence He went to their synagogue,
012:010 where there was a man with a shrivelled arm.
        And they questioned Him, "Is it right to cure people on
        the Sabbath?"  Their intention was to bring a charge against Him.
012:011 "Which of you is there," He replied, "who, if he has but
        a single sheep and it falls into a hole on the Sabbath,
        will not lay hold of it and lift it out?
012:012 Is not a man, however, far superior to a sheep?
        Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath."
012:013 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your arm."
        And he stretched it out, and it was restored quite sound
        like the other.
012:014 But the Pharisees after leaving the synagogue consulted together
        against Him, how they might destroy Him.
012:015 Aware of this, Jesus departed elsewhere; and a great number
        of people followed Him, all of whom He cured.
012:016 But He gave them strict injunctions not to blaze abroad His doings,
012:017 that those words of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,
012:018 "This is My servant whom I have chosen, My dearly loved One
        in whom My soul takes pleasure.  I will put My spirit upon Him,
        and He will announce justice to the nations.
012:019 He will not wrangle or raise His voice, nor will His voice
        be heard in the broadways.
012:020 A crushed reed He will not utterly break, nor will He quench
        the still smouldering wick, until He has led on Justice to victory.
012:021 And on His name shall the nations rest their hopes."
012:022 At that time a demoniac was brought to Him, blind and dumb;
        and He cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.
012:023 And the crowds of people were all filled with amazement and said,
        "Can this be the Son of David?"
012:024 The Pharisees heard it and said, "This man only expels demons
        by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of demons."
012:025 Knowing their thoughts He said to them, "Every kingdom in which
        civil war has raged suffers desolation; and every city or house
        in which there is internal strife will be brought low.
012:026 And if Satan is expelling Satan, he has begun to make war on himself:
        how therefore shall his kingdom last?
012:027 And if it is by Baal-zebul's power that I expel the demons,
        by whose power do your disciples expel them?  They therefore
        shall be your judges.
012:028 But if it is by the power of the Spirit of God that I expel
        the demons, it is evident that the Kingdom of God has
        come upon you.
012:029 Again, how can any one enter the house of a strong man and carry
        off his goods, unless first of all he masters and secures
        the strong man:  then he will ransack his house.
012:030 "The man who is not with me is against me, and he who is not
        gathering with me is scattering abroad.
012:031 This is why I tell you that men may find forgiveness for every
        other sin and impious word, but that for impious speaking
        against the Holy Spirit they shall find no forgiveness.
012:032 And whoever shall speak against the Son of Man may obtain forgiveness;
        but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, neither in this
        nor in the coming age shall he obtain forgiveness."
012:033 "Either grant the tree to be wholesome and its fruit wholesome,
        or the tree poisonous and its fruit poisonous; for the tree
        is known by its fruit.
012:034 O vipers' brood, how can you speak what is good when you are evil?
        For it is from the overflow of the heart that the mouth speaks.
012:035 A good man from his good store produces good things, and a bad
        man from his bad store produces bad things.
012:036 But I tell you that for every careless word that men shall
        speak they will be held accountable on the day of Judgement.
012:037 For each of you by his words shall be justified, or by his words
        shall be condemned."
012:038 Then He was accosted by some of the Scribes and of the Pharisees
        who said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign given by you."
012:039 "Wicked and faithless generation!"  He replied, "they clamour
        for a sign, but none shall be given to them except the sign
        of the Prophet Jonah.
012:040 For just as Jonah was three days in the sea-monster's belly,
        so will the Son of Man be three days in the heart of the earth.
012:041 There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement
        together with the present generation, and will condemn it;
        because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and mark!
        there is One greater than Jonah here.
012:042 The Queen of the south will awake at the Judgement together
        with the present generation, and will condemn it; because she
        came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        and mark! there is One greater than Solomon here.
012:043 "No sooner however has the foul spirit gone out of the man,
        then he roams about in places where there is no water,
        seeking rest but finding none.
012:044 Then he says, `I will return to my house that I left;'
        and he comes and finds it unoccupied, swept clean,
        and in good order.
012:045 Then he goes and brings back with him seven other spirits more
        wicked than himself, and they come in and dwell there; and in
        the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first.
        So will it be also with the present wicked generation."
012:046 While He was still addressing the people His mother and His
        brothers were standing on the edge of the crowd desiring
        to speak to Him.
012:047 So some one told Him, "Your mother and your brothers are
        standing outside, and desire to speak to you."
012:048 "Who is my mother?"  He said to the man; "and who are my brothers?"
012:049 And pointing to His disciples He added, "See here are my mother
        and my brothers.
012:050 To obey my Father who is in Heaven--that is to be my brother
        and my sister and my mother."
013:001 That same day Jesus had left the house and was sitting on
        the shore of the Lake,
013:002 when a vast multitude of people crowded round Him.
        He therefore went on board a boat and sat there, while all
        the people stood on the shore.
013:003 He then spoke many things to them in figurative language.
        "The sower goes out," He said, "to sow.
013:004 As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds
        come and peck it up.
013:005 Some falls on rocky ground, where it has but scanty soil.
        It quickly shows itself above ground, because it has no
        depth of earth;
013:006 but when the sun is risen, it is scorched by the heat,
        and through having no root it withers up.
013:007 Some falls among the thorns; but the thorns spring up
        and stifle it.
013:008 But a portion falls upon good ground, and gives a return,
        some a hundred for one, some sixty, some thirty.
013:009 Listen, every one who has ears!"
013:010 (And His disciples came and asked Him, "Why do you speak
        to them in figurative language?"
013:011 "Because," He replied, "while to you it is granted to know
        the secrets of the Kingdom of the Heavens, to them it is not.
013:012 For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he shall
        have abundance; but whoever has not, from him even what he has
        shall be taken away.
013:013 I speak to them in figurative language for this reason,
        that while looking they do not see, and while hearing they
        neither hear nor understand.
013:014 And in regard to them the prophecy of Isaiah is receiving
        signal fulfilment:  "`You will hear and hear and by no
        means understand, and you will look and look and by no means see.
013:015 For this people's mind is stupefied, their hearing has
        become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent
        their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears,
        or understanding with their minds, and turning back,
        so that I might heal them.'
013:016 "But as for you, blessed are your eyes, for they see,
        and your ears, for they hear.
013:017 For I solemnly tell you that many Prophets and holy men have
        longed to see the sights you see, and have not seen them,
        and to hear the words you hear, and have not heard them.
013:018 "To you then I will explain the parable of the Sower.
013:019 When a man hears the Message concerning the Kingdom and does
        not understand it, the Evil one comes and catches away what has
        been sown in his heart.  This is he who has received the seed
        by the road-side.
013:020 He who has received the seed on the rocky ground is the man
        who hears the Message and immediately receives it with joy.
013:021 It has struck no root, however, within him.  He continues
        for a time, but when suffering comes, or persecution,
        because of the Message, he at once stumbles and falls.
013:022 He who has received the seed among the thorns is the man
        who hears the Message, but the cares of the present age
        and the delusions of riches quite stifle the Message,
        and it becomes unfruitful.
013:023 But he who has received the seed on good ground is he who hears
        and understands.  Such hearers give a return, and yield one
        a hundred for one, another sixty, another thirty.")
013:024 Another parable He put before them.  "The Kingdom of
        the Heavens," He said, "may be compared to a man who has sown
        good seed in his field,
013:025 but during the night his enemy comes, and over the first seed
        he sows darnel among the wheat, and goes away.
013:026 But when the blade shoots up and the grain is formed,
        then appears the darnel also.
013:027 "So the farmer's men come and ask him, "`Sir, was it not
        good seed that you sowed on your land?  Where then does
        the darnel come from?'
013:028 "`Some enemy has done this,' he said.  "`Shall we go,
        and collect it?' the men inquire.
013:029 "`No,' he replied, `for fear that while collecting the darnel
        you should at the same time root up the wheat with it.
013:030 Leave both to grow together until the harvest, and at harvest-time
        I will direct the reapers, Collect the darnel first,
        and make it up into bundles to burn it, but bring all the wheat
        into my barn.'"
013:031 Another parable He put before them.  "The Kingdom of
        the Heavens," He said, "is like a mustard-seed, which a man
        takes and sows in his ground.
013:032 It is the smallest of all seeds, and yet when full-grown it
        is larger than any herb and forms a tree, so that the birds
        come and build in its branches."
013:033 Another parable He spoke to them.  "The Kingdom of
        the Heavens," He said, "is like yeast which a woman takes
        and buries in a bushel of flour, for it to work there till
        the whole mass has risen."
013:034 All this Jesus spoke to the people in figurative language,
        and except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them,
013:035 in fulfilment of the saying of the Prophet, "I will open
        my mouth in figurative language, I will utter things kept
        hidden since the creation of all things."
013:036 When He had dismissed the people and had returned to the house,
        His disciples came to Him with the request, "Explain to us
        the parable of the darnel sown in the field."
013:037 "The sower of the good seed," He replied, "is the Son of Man;
013:038 the field is the world; the good seed--these are the sons
        of the Kingdom; the darnel, the sons of the Evil one.
013:039 The enemy who sows the darnel is *the Devil*; the harvest
        is the Close of the Age; the reapers are the angels.
013:040 As then the darnel is collected together and burnt up with fire,
        so will it be at the Close of the Age.
013:041 The Son of Man will commission His angels, and they will gather
        out of His Kingdom all causes of sin and all who violate His laws;
013:042 and these they will throw into the fiery furnace.
        There will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.
013:043 Then will the righteous shine out like the sun in their
        Father's Kingdom.  Listen, every one who has ears!
013:044 "The Kingdom of the Heavens is like treasure buried in
        the open country, which a man finds, but buries again, and,
        in his joy about it, goes and sells all he has and buys
        that piece of ground.
013:045 "Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a jewel merchant
        who is in quest of choice pearls.
013:046 He finds one most costly pearl; he goes away; and though it
        costs all he has, he buys it.
013:047 "Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a draw-net let
        down into the sea, which encloses fish of all sorts.
013:048 When full, they haul it up on the beach, and sit down and collect
        the good fish in baskets, while the worthless they throw away.
