_And not one cent to create them!_

--I have saved the chief thing to the last. I have spoken of the six
fortunate ones who had money; I have not spoken of thee, oh my poor, poor
Keats! The hours that I have hungered with thee, the hours that I have wept
with thee, oh thou _my_ poet, oh thou _my_ Keats! Oh thou most
wretched, most miserable of poets, oh thou most beautiful, most exquisite,
most unthinkable of poets! Most inspired poet of England, since Milton
died!--It was given to others to be beautiful, it was given to thee alone
to be perfect! It was given to thee to be ecstasy incarnate, to be melody
too sweet to hear! It was given to thee, alone of all poets, to achieve by
mere _language_ a rapture that thrills the soul like the sound of an
organ. And they mocked thee, they spit upon thee, they cursed thee, oh my
poor, poor Keats! Thou, the hostler's son--thou, the apothecary's clerk!
Thou, sick and starved and helpless--thou, dying of disease and neglect and
despair:

  Oh for a draft of vintage! That hath been
    Cool'd a long age in the deep-delvèd earth,
  Tasting of Flora and the country green,
    Dance and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
  Oh for a beaker full of the warm South,
    Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
      With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
  And purple-stainèd mouth;
    That I might drink and leave the world unseen,
       And with thee fade away into the forest dim!

"O happy child! the glorious day shall shine, When every ear shall to thy
speech incline, Thy words alluring and thy voice divine:
The sullen pedant and the sprightly wit, To hear thy soothing eloquence
shall sit; And both, abjuring Flattery, will agree That Truth inspires,
and they must honour thee.

       "Envy himself shall to thy accents bend, Force a faint smile, and
sullenly attend, When thou shalt call him Virtue's jealous friend,
Whose bosom glows with generous rage to find How fools and knaves
are flatter'd by mankind.

Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,
  And feeds her grief with his remembered lay!

       *       *       *       *       *

I have been sitting here from seven in the evening until three in the
morning, and I can not write any more.

       *       *       *       *       *

Only--think about this thing. Look up the facts and see if they are not
true. These seven men _made_ England's poetry for a century; they made
England's _thought_ for a century--they make it to-day! They are the
inspiration of whole peoples, the sources of multitudes of noble deeds and
purposes. What do you think in money would be represented by the value of
these books alone? Enough to support ten thousand poets for a lifetime, do
you think? And how many hundreds of thousands of students are hearing about
them this day? How many young men and maidens are going out into the world
owing all that they have that is beautiful to them? And all these authors
of the day, all these critics and teachers, novelists and poets--how much
of what they have that is true do they not owe to these men? Go ask them,
go ask them!

       *       *       *       *       *

--And you have it all because of the accident that these men were
independent! You have all from six of them for that, and from the seventh
you have nothing--yes, almost nothing--because he was poor! Because he was
a hostler's son, and not a gentleman's son; and you sent him back to his
gallipots and to his grave.

I wait to hear from the publisher merely as a matter of duty. Oh! by the GOD
who loves to spare, Deny me not the boon I crave; Let this loved
child your mercy share, And let me find a peaceful grave:
Make her yet spotless soul your care, And let my sins their portion
have; Her for a better fate prepare, And punish whom 'twere sin to
save!

       MAGISTRATE.

Recall the word, renounce the thought, Command thy heart and bend
thy knee; There is to all a pardon brought, A ransom rich, assured
and free; 'Tis full when found, 'tis found if sought, Oh!

       

Then there would have
been no trouble.

       *       *       *       *       *

When I thought of that I smiled grimly. I am living on dry bread, and
saving my money to buy a dumb-bell and a chain on Friday.

       *       *       *       *       *

I pray most of the time. I have no longer the old ecstasy--such things do
not come often in cities. But it will come once again before I die, that I
know.

       *       *       *       *       *

I have a strange attitude toward death. To me it is nothing. There is, of
course, the pain of drowning--it probably hurts to be strangled, but I do
not think it will hurt as much as ten lines of The Captive hurt.

       *       *       *       *       *

About the physical part of it, the "invisible corruption," I never think;
it is enough that it will be invisible. And for the rest, death is nothing,
it is the end. I have never shrunk from the thought of it, it does not come
as a stranger to me now. I take it simply and naturally--it is the end. It
is the end that comes to all things in this phantom-dance of being; to
flowers and to music, to mountains and to planets, to histories, and to
universes, and to men.

       *       *       *       *       *

I said: "It must come some day. It may come any day. Love not thy life too
much--know what thou art."

       *       *       *       *       *

God can spare me. He got along without me once, and doubtless he can do it
again. There are many things that I should like to see--I should like to
see all the ages; but that was not my fateHe spake, and vanish'd, other prey to find, And waste in slow disease
the conquer'd mind.

       Awed by the elfin's threats, and fill'd with dread The parents wept,
and sought their infant's bed; Despair alone the father's soul
possess'd; But hope rose gently in the mother's breast; For well
she knew that neither grief nor joy Pain'd without hope, or pleased
without alloy; And while these hopes and fears her heart divide, A
cheerful vision bade the fears subside.

She saw descending to the world below An ancient form, with solemn pace and
slow.

       "Daughter, no more be sad" (the phantom cried), "Success is seldom
to the wise denied; In idle wishes fools supinely stay, Be there a
will, and wisdom finds a way:
Why art thou grieved?



       *       *       *       *       *

--No, the sight of death does not thrill me in the least--when I stand upon
the brink it will not thrill me. It is not fearful; what the weakest of men
have done, I can do. And it is not sublime. Life is sublime, life thrills
me; death is nothing.

June 5th.

To-day I wished that it were winter. A wonderful idea came to me--I am
almost tempted to live and wait for winter. I said: I would choose one
place where the money-blind and the folly-mad assemble--where I have seen
them and had my eyes burned by the sight. I would go to the opera-house
on the opening night! I would go to the top gallery, and I would put my
journal, my story, under my coat; and in the midst of the thing I would
give one cry, to startle them; and I would dash down that long flight of
steps, and shoot over the railing headfirst.

--Ha! That would make them think! They might read the book, then.

What place could be more fitted? In an opera-house meet, as nowhere else in
this world that I know of, the two extremes of life--God and the devil. I
mean on a Wagner night! Here is the inspiration of a sainted poet, here is
ecstasy unthinkable, flung wide and glorious as the dawn; and here is all
the sodden and brutal vulgarity of wealth, deaf, blind, and strutting in
its insolent pomposity.

       *       *       *       *       *

--I am very ill to-day--I have a splitting headache and I am weak. It
is from trying to save too much money for the dumb-bell, I fear. But I
laugh--what care I? My body is going to wreck--but what care I? Ah, it is a
fine thing to be death-devoted, and freed from all the ills that flesh is
heir to! I go my way--do what I please--hammer on and on, and let happen
what will. What, old head!--wilt ache? I guess I can stop thy aching
before long! And all ye mechanical miscellaneities--stomachs and what not!
_Thou_ wilt trouble me too? Do thy pleasure, go thy way--I go mine!

       *       *       *       *       *

There is a kind of intoxication in it. I climb upon all these ills that
used to frighten me--I mock at them, I am a god. I smite my head--I say, "I
am done with thee, old head! I have thought with thee all the thoughts I
have to think!"

       *       *       *       *       *

I have made me right drunk upon life, yes, that is the truth; and now the
feast is over, and I will smash the crockery! Come, boys, come!--Away with
it! Through the window here with the head--look out of the way below there
for the stomach--ha, ha!

--Is not that Shakespearian humor for you? Such a thing it is to be
death-devoted!

       *       *       *       *       *

--But there is a deeper side to this wonderful thing--this prospect of
peace--this end of pain. All these solemn realities that were so much to
thee--this "world" and all its ways--its conventions and proprieties, its
duties and its trials; how now, do they seem so much to thee after all?
he'll cry (for he will call thee Fame), From thee I fly, from thee conceal
my name; But thou shalt say, though Genius takes his night, He leaves behind
a glorious train of light, And hides in vain: --yet prudent he that
flies The flatterer's art, and for himself is wise.Ah, thou canst not come with me, but thou wilt
come after me some day, never fear. This is a journey that each man goes
alone.

Oh, it is easy to be a man when you are sentenced to die. Then all things
slip into their places, power and pride, wealth and fame--what strange
fantasies they seem! What tales I could tell the world at this minute, of
how their ways seem to me!--Oh, take my advice, good friend, and pray thy
God for one hour in which thou mayst see the truth of all those foolish
great things of thy life!

       *       *       *       *       *

I read Alastor this afternoon. What a strange vision it is! And I, too, in
awe and mystery shall journey away unto a high mountain to die.

       *       *       *       *       *

--And then later I went out into the Park. I saw a flower; and suddenly the
wild ecstasy flashed over me, and I sank down upon a seat, and hid my face
in my hands, and everything swirled black about me. I cried: "I do not
want to die! Why, I am only a boy! I love the flowers--I want to see the
springtime!"

And then I felt some one take me by the shoulder, and heard a grim voice
within me say, "Come! Come!"

       "I see thee breathing on the barren moor, That seems to bloom
although so bleak before; There, if beneath the gorse the primrose
spring, Or the pied daisy smile below the ling, They shall new
charms, at thy command disclose, And none shall miss the myrtle or
the rose.

I go for it to-morrow.

       *       *       *       *       *

June 6th.

Last night I knelt by the bedside, far into the deep hours, far into the
dawn. The whole drama of my life rolled out before me, I saw it all, I
lived it all again; and Him in whose arms I lay--I blessed Him for the
whole of it. Now that the pain is gone I see that it was beautiful, that
flower of my life. Other flowers the plant might have borne; but this
flower was beautiful; and each flower is for itself.
