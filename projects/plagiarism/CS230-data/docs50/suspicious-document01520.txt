The Buffalo Runners, A tale of the Red River Plains, by R.M. Ballantyne.

________________________________________________________________________

Here once again Ballantyne is on familiar ground.  The theme is the
trials and tribulations suffered by the early settlers, the pioneers, in
the lands to the east of the Rockies, in particular in the Red River
basin, where it flows northwards into Lake Winnipeg.  There are problems
with bad men of their own settlement; bad men from the other main fur
company (our heroes worked with the Hudson Bay Company), the
Nor'westers; Sioux and Salteaux Indians; a plague of grass-hoppers; a
plague of mice; storms that destroyed fishing-gear such as nets; Cree
Indians as well as the other two tribes; bad decisions and actions by
the advisors of Lord Selkirk, who was in charge of the whole operation
of settlement; accidental wounds.  The heroes of the tale are two young
boys, one of whom is "disabled" and weak, but both are shining examples
of goodness and bravery.  The women of the tale are of course all
beautiful and devoted members of their various households.  The men of
the tale vary between the competent and the incompetent; the lazy and
idle, and the industrious;  the cunning, and the stupid.

It might be quite a good idea to read the book more than once, so that
you can get it clear in your mind who is on whose side!

THE BUFFALO RUNNERS; A TALE OF THE RED RIVER PLAINS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.


CHAPTER ONE.

A TALE OF THE RED RIVER PLAINS.

HELP!

A blizzard was blowing wildly over the American prairies one winter day
in the earlier part of the present century.

Fresh, free and straight, it came from the realms of Jack Frost, and
cold--bitterly cold--like the bergs on the Arctic seas, to which it had
but recently said farewell.

Snow, fine as dust and sharp as needles, was caught up bodily by the
wind in great masses--here in snaky coils, there in whirling eddies,
elsewhere in rolling clouds; but these had barely time to assume
indefinite forms when they were furiously scattered and swept away as by
the besom of destruction, while earth and sky commingled in a smother of
whitey-grey.

All the demons of the Far North seemed to have taken an outside passage
on that blizzard, so tremendous was the roaring and shrieking, while the
writhing of tormented snow-drifts suggested powerfully the madness of
agony.

Two white and ghostly pillars moved slowly but steadily through all this
hurly-burly in a straight line.  One of the pillars was short and broad;
the other was tall and stately.  Both were very solid--agreeably so,
when contrasted with surrounding chaos.  Suddenly the two pillars
stopped--though the gale did not.

Said the short pillar to the tall one--

"Taniel Tavidson, if we will not get to the Settlement this night; it
iss my belief that every one o' them will perish."

"Fergus," replied the tall pillar, sternly, "they shall _not_ perish if
I can help it.  At all events, if they do, I shall die in the attempt to
save them.  Come on."

Daniel Davidson became less like a white pillar as he spoke, and more
like a man, by reason of his shaking a good deal of the snow off his
stalwart person.  Fergus McKay followed his comrade's example, and
revealed the fact--for a few minutes--that beneath the snow-mask there
stood a young man with a beaming countenance of fiery red, the flaming
character of which, however, was relieved by an expression of ineffable
good-humour.

The two men resumed their march over the dreary plain in silence.
Indeed, conversation in the circumstances was out of the question.  The
brief remarks that had been made when they paused to recover breath were
howled at each other while they stood face to face.

The nature of the storm was such that the gale seemed to rush at the
travellers from all quarters at once--including above and below.  Men of
less vigour and resolution would have been choked by it; but men who
don't believe in choking, and have thick necks, powerful frames, vast
experience, and indomitable wills are not easily choked!

"It blows hard--whatever," muttered Fergus to himself, with that
prolonged emphasis on the last syllable of the last word which is
eminently suggestive of the Scottish Highlander.

Davidson may have heard the remark, but he made no reply.

Day declined, but its exit was not marked by much difference in the very
feeble light, and the two men held steadily on.  The moon came out.  As
far as appearances went she might almost as well have stayed in, for
nobody saw her that night.  Her mere existence somewhere in the sky,
however, rendered the indescribable chaos visible.  Hours passed by, but
still the two men held on their way persistently.

They wore five-feet-long snow-shoes.  Progress over the deep snow
without these would have been impossible.  One traveller walked behind
the other to get the benefit of his beaten track, but the benefit was
scarcely appreciable, for the whirling snow filled each footstep up
almost as soon as it was made.  Two days and a night had these men
travelled with but an hour or two of rest in the shelter of a copse,
without fire, and almost without food, yet they pushed on with the
energy of fresh and well-fed men.

Nothing but some overpowering necessity could have stimulated them to
such prolonged and severe exertion.  Even self-preservation might have
failed to nerve them to it, for both had well-nigh reached the limit of
their exceptional powers, but each was animated by a stronger motive
than self.  Fergus had left his old father in an almost dying state on
the snow-clad plains, and Davidson had left his affianced bride.

The buffalo-hunt had failed that year; winter had set in with unwonted
severity and earlier than usual.  The hunters, with the women and
children who followed them in carts to help and to reap the benefit of
the hunt, were starving.  Their horses died or were frozen to death;
carts were snowed up; and the starving hunters had been scattered in
making the best of their way back to the Settlement of Red River from
which they had started.

When old McKay broke down, and his only daughter Elspie had firmly
asserted her determination to remain and die with him, Fergus McKay and
Daniel Davidson felt themselves to be put upon their mettle--called on
to face a difficulty of the most appalling nature.  To remain on the
snow-clad prairie without food or shelter would be death to all, for
there was no living creature there to be shot or trapped.  On the other
hand, to travel a hundred miles or so on foot--and without food, seemed
an impossibility.  Love, however, ignores the impossible!  The two young
men resolved on the attempt.  They were pretty well aware of the extent
of their physical powers.  They would put them fairly to the test for
once--even though for the last time!  They prepared for the old man and
his daughter a shelter in the heart of a clump of willows, near to which
spot they had found a group of the hapless hunters already dead and
frozen.

Here, as far from the frozen group as possible, they made an encampment
by digging down through the snow till the ground was reached.  As much
dried wood as could be found was collected, and a fire made.  The young
men left their blankets behind, and, of the small quantity of provisions
that remained, they took just sufficient to sustain life.  Then, with
cheery words of encouragement, they said good-bye, and set out on their
journey to the Settlement for help.

The object at which they aimed was almost gained at the point when we
introduce them to the reader.

"Taniel!" said Fergus, coming to a sudden halt.

"Well?" exclaimed the other.

"It iss sleepy that I am.  Maybe if I wass to lie down--"

He ceased to speak.  Davidson looked anxiously into his face, and saw
that he had already begun to give way to irresistible drowsiness.
Without a moment's hesitation he seized the Highlander by the throat,
and shook him as if he had been a mere baby.

"Iss it for fightin' ye are?" said Fergus, whose good-nature was not
proof against such rough and unexpected treatment.

"Yes, my boy, that's just what I am for, and I think you'll get the
worst of it too."

"What iss that you say?  Ay, ay!  You will hev to bend your back then,
Taniel, for it iss not every wan that can give Fergus McKay the worst of
it!"

Davidson made no reply, but gave his comrade a shake so violent that it
put to flight the last vestige of his good-humour and induced him to
struggle so fiercely that in a few minutes the drowsiness was also, and
effectually, driven away.

"You'll do now," said Davidson, relaxing his grip and panting somewhat.

"Ay, Taniel, I will be doin' now.  An' you're a frund in need whatever,"
returned the restored Highlander with a smile of appreciation.

About an hour later the travellers again stopped.  This time it was
Davidson who called a halt.

"Fergus," he said, "we have been successful so far, thank God.  But we
must part here.  Half-an-hour will take me to my father's house, and I
want you to go down to the hut of Francois La Certe; it is nearer than
our house, you know--and get him to help you."

"Surely, Tan, that will be wasted time," objected the Highlander.  "Of
all the lazy useless scamps in Rud Ruver, Francois La Certe iss the
laziest an' most useless."

"Useful enough for our purpose, however," returned Davidson.  "Send him
up to Fort Garry with a message, while you lie down and rest.  If you
don't rest, you will yourself be useless in a short time.  La Certe is
not such a bad fellow as people think him, specially when his feelings
are touched."

"That may be as you say, Tan.  I will try--_whatever_."

So saying, the two men parted and hurried on their several ways.


CHAPTER TWO.

A LAZY COUPLE DESCRIBED--AND ROUSED.

Francois La Certe was seated on the floor of his hut smoking a long clay
pipe beside an open wood fire when Fergus McKay approached.  His wife
was seated beside him calmly smoking a shorter pipe with obvious
enjoyment.

The man was a Canadian half-breed.  His wife was an Indian woman.  They
were both moderately young and well matched, for they thoroughly agreed
in everything conceivable--or otherwise.  In the length and breadth of
the Settlement there could not have been found a lazier or more
good-natured or good-for-nothing couple than La Certe and his spouse.
Love was, if we may venture to say so, the chief element in the
character of each.  Love of self was the foundation.  Then, happily,
love of each other came next.  Rising gracefully, the superstructure may
be described as, love of tobacco, love of tea, love of ease, and love of
general comfort, finishing off with a top-dressing, or capital, of
pronounced, decided, and apparently incurable love of indolence.  They
had only one clear and unmistakable hatred about them, and that was the
hatred of work.  They had a child about four years of age which was
like-minded--and not unlike-bodied.

All you looking was her collection - and her cries now, they have the
clouds as high as the sky itself is collected to see? What a perverted
love euerm is the child that you want to come to their senses,
as you can see that it is glüklich! Troknet your Thränen, umstekt

ready to leave such beautiful corpse on her grave to accompany and
guard you, through the impatience of grumbling about you floating anger
of heaven nor more to irritate. (They go from.) Sixth Scene.

Erste Scene. (Mantua.) (Romeo meets on.) Romeo. If I were the
inspirations flattering sleep should marry, so my dreams were pleasant

raises me with pleasant thoughts about the ground up, I dreamed that my
lover would find me and would Todt - (What a strange thing is a dream
that he still Todt people permission giebt to think!)

- and breathed through their kisses such a life in my lips that I am back

how sweet is the würkliche enjoyment of love, because their shade is

- What's Balthasar? Teach me letters from the Father? What is my
mistress? Is my father well? What makes my Juliette? I must ask
again, because if she is, so nothing is amiss.

Balthasar. So it is probably because nothing is amiss. Your body sleeps
in the funerals of the Capulets, and their immortal lives with
angels Theil. I saw them in the vault of the family, and took it immediately
to post your own report. Forgiveness, Gracious Lord, that my service
nöthigt me to give you such a nasty newspaper to bring! Romeo.

Würklich Is it so? - Sun biet 'ich euch Troz their star - You know my
apartment, go, get me Dinter and paper, and to order post-horses - I
want this night still continues.

Balthasar. To pardon, Gracious Lord, I can not leave you. Your Blik are
bleak and wild, and mean nothing good. Romeo. Silence! you cheat yourself.
Thu and leave me what I say to thee: Hast thou no letters from the
Father in me?

Balthasar. No, Gracious Lord. Romeo. That does not mean: go and order the
horses, and I will like you Seyn Bey. (Balthasar goes ab.)

Well, Juliette, tonight I want you unicellular Bey - Let's see how we do
it? How quickly will doom the entrance into a despairing Gemüth!

- Erinnre I am a pharmacist who lived here at some, and I lezthin in a
ragged coat, with the overhang Augbrauen, was looking for herbs. I took
the man into the eye; Blik saw his lean and starved out, grief and misery
seemed to him to the bone abgenuzt to have in his squalid shack
hieng a turtle, a stuffed alligator, and a few other skins from
mißgeschaffnen fish; and around on the racks stuhnd like a mendicant

Holla! he! Pharmacist. (The pharmacist comes out.) Pharmacist. Who calls

I see you are poor, see, there are forty Ducat, gieb poison me a drachma

Romeo. Here is thy gold, a harmful poison for the souls of the people, and
what more Mordthaten-free healing in this world caused when these poor
Quaksalbereyen, you do not verkauffen kanst: I have sold poison you,
not me - going well, you buy to eat, and do, that thou comest to flesh -
Come on, heart-strengthening, not poison, come with me where I need
you to Juliette grave. (They go from.) Zweyte Scene. (Transforms into
the monastery to Verona.) (brother Johann occurs.) Johann. Venerable Son
of the holy Franciscus, brother! he! (Lawrence's brother comes out.)
Lorenz.

The brother should Johanns Seyn voice - Welcome from Mantua: what
says Romeo? Or did you give me a letter from him? Johann. Because
I wanted to leave, I went a Baarfusser-brother of our Order for travel
companions to seek, here in the city was to beyzustehen sick. I found
him, but from the way we wanted to go home, Visitatore came to the
city, and because they had suspicions that the house worinn they
found us a anstekende disease Grassie, they sealed the doors and
let us not continue; so therefore my trip to Mantua had to be
omitted.

Lorenz. Who gave you my letter to Romeo? Johann. I could 'not
fortschiken him, here he is again, I could not even find someone, who
would have brought you back, so great was their fear, they want to be
angestekt.

Lorenz. unglüklicher That is a coincidence! Bey-Order my vows, the
letter contained classified information of greater importance, and this
failure can have nasty consequences. Brother, John, go, creating me a
crushing iron and bring me into my Celle. Lorenz. Now I alone in the
tomb, in the next three hours the beautiful Juliette awaken - How
is it about me Schmähl that her Romeo all of these incidents has
not heard, but I will again write Mantua, however, and they hide in

Todt-crypt to draw! - (He's up.) Third Scene. (Turns into a cemetery
- in the same family tomb of the Capulets.) (Paris and his
page with a Fakel, come on.) Paris. Gieb your Fakel me, boy: 'Go and
stand from a distance.

But no, they do, I do not want to be seen - Leg dich, du bist so

ground, no feet on this cemetery can occur without that you hear it,
and when you hear that something is approaching, so hissing

I am sincerely afraid, so alone here on the churchyard Seyn, but I will

Fourth Scene. (Romeo and Balthasar with a light.) Romeo. Gieb me the

Gieb me the light, so fond of thy life, commanding 'ichs thee, thou mayest

Why I descend into the crypt, it and some my lover again to see, but

The time and my intentions are cruel and wild, fierce and relentless as
a blood-lechzende Tyger and the wailing sea. Balthasar.

I want to go, Gracious Lord, and you do not disturb. Romeo. Kanst So you
show me your friends - Take thou the; leb and sey glüklich, fahrwohl,
good boy. Balthasar (leaving in front of you.) All this gives me more
stronger motivation for me around here to hide. I fear his Blik, and
doubt that he was in good sense. Romeo. Schlund you vile, accursed

Verurtheilter baddie, I am thy conquer; obey, go with me, thou must die.
Romeo. I must, in That, and that's why I came hieher - good young man,

Paris. I despise thy pity, and arrestiere you here as a Hochverräther.

Romeo. How do you want me with violence because irritate? Have at

God, they fight, I will go and fetch the guard. Paris. Oh, I am of
death; some mercy if you're capable of, so open the vault and put
me to Juliette.

(He dies.) Romeo. On my honor, I will: Let me this face in the
vicinity IS - Mercutio's cousin! the noble Count Paris! what did my
servant underway by storm in my soul herumgewälzte Eight was not what

Did he not? or dreaming's just me? Or am I foolish, that I imagine it

As he mentions? Balthasar. Romeo . Lorenz.

How long is he already there? Balthasar. A full half hour. Lorenz. go

Lord - My Lord knows nothing other than that I'd left sey, and

I probably erinnre me where I Seyn, and I'm there - but where is

Come, go, dear Juliette, I can not stay longer - (He goes.)

Juliette.

Go, go thou, and let me stay here - What is here?

A cup in hand my lover? - Poison, I seh, his untimely death was - O thou

Guard. Weis' us the way, boy. Juliette. So? Does anyone? So I will just
make - (they findt a dagger.) Glüklicher O dagger!

Here is your vagina, grids here and let me die. (stabs you are.) boy.
Here is the place, where the Fakel burns.
Four strong large dogs were attached to each sledge in tandem fashion,
each dog having a little collar and harness of its own.  No reins were
necessary.  A track beaten in the soft snow with his snow-shoes by the
Indian, who stepped out in front, was guide enough for them; and a
tail-line attached to the rear of each sledge, and held by the drivers,
sufficed to restrain them when a stretch of hard snow or ice tempted
them to have a scamper.

The road thus beaten over the prairie by Okematan, though a
comparatively soft one, was by no means smooth, and the rough motion
would, in ordinary circumstances, have rendered sleep impossible to our
hero; but it need hardly be said that it failed to disturb him on the
present occasion.  He slept like an infant throughout the whole night;
cared nothing for the many plunges down the prairie waves, and recked
not of the frequent jerks out of the hollows.

Hour after hour did Peter Davidson with his silent companion trudge over
the monotonous plains--hope in the ascendant, and vigour, apparently,
inexhaustible.  The dogs, too, were good and strong.  A brief halt now
and then of a few minutes sufficed to freshen them for every new start.
Night passed away, and daylight came in with its ghostly revelations of
bushes that looked like bears or buffaloes, and snow-wreaths that
suggested the buried forms of frozen men.

Then the sun arose and scattered these sombre visions of early morning
with its gladdening, soul-reviving rays.

At this point the rescue-party chanced to have reached one of those
bluffs of woodland which at that time speckled the plains--though they
were few indeed and far between.

"Breakfast," said Peter, heaving a profound sigh as he turned about and
checked the teams, for at that point he happened to be in advance
beating the track.

Okematan expressed his entire concurrence with an emphatic "Ho!"  The
wearied dogs lay down in their tracks, shot out their tongues, panted,
and looked amiable, for well they knew the meaning of the word
"breakfast" and the relative halt.

The sudden stoppage awoke the sleeper, and he struggled to rise.

"Hallo!  What's wrong?  Where am I?  Have the Redskins got hold o' me at
last?"

"Ay, that they have.  At least one Red-skin has got you," said Peter.
"Have a care, man, don't struggle so violently.  Okematan won't scalp
you."

The sound of his brother's voice quieted Davidson, and at once restored
his memory.

"Cast me loose, Peter," he said; "you're a good fellow.  I see you have
brought me along wi' you, and I feel like a giant refreshed now, tho'
somewhat stiff.  Have we come far?"

"I don't know how far we've come, but I know that we've been pegging
along the whole night, and that we must have breakfast before we take
another step.  It's all very well for you, Dan, to lie there all night
like a mere bag o' pemmican enjoying yourself, but you must remember
that your brother is mortal, and so are the dogs, to say nothing o' the
Red-skin."

While he was speaking, the youth undid the fastenings, and set his
brother free, but Dan was far too anxious to indulge in pleasantries
just then.  After surveying the landscape, and coming to a conclusion as
to where they were, he took a hurried breakfast of dried meat--cold.
The dogs were also treated to a hearty feed, and then, resuming the
march, the rescuers pushed on with renewed vigour--Dan Davidson now
beating the track, and thus rendering it more easy for those who came
behind him.

All that day they pushed on almost without halt, and spent the next
night in a clump of willows; but Dan was too anxious to take much rest.
They rose at the first sign of daybreak, and pushed on at their utmost
speed, until the poor dogs began to show signs of breaking down; but an
extra hour of rest, and a full allowance of food kept them up to the
mark, while calm weather and clear skies served to cheer them on their
way.


CHAPTER FOUR.

TELLS OF LOVE, DUTY, STARVATION, AND MURDER.

Pushing on ahead of them, with that sometimes fatal facility peculiar to
writers and readers, we will now visit the couple whom Dan and his party
were so anxious to rescue.

A single glance at Elspie McKay would have been sufficient to account to
most people for the desperate anxiety of Daniel Davidson to rescue her
from death, for her pretty sparkling face and ever-varying expression
were irresistibly suggestive of a soul full of sympathy and tender
regard for the feelings of others.

Nut-brown hair, dark eyes, brilliant teeth, and many more charms that it
would take too much time and room to record still further accounted for
the desperate determination with which Dan had wooed and won her.

But to see this creature at her best, you had to see her doing the
dutiful to her old father.  If ever there was a peevish, cross-grained,
crabbed, unreasonable old sinner in this world, that sinner was Duncan
McKay, senior.  He was a widower.  Perhaps that accounted to some extent
for his condition.  That he should have a younger son--also named
Duncan--a cross ne'er-do-weel like himself--was natural, but how he came
to have such a sweet daughter as Elspie, and such a good elder son as
Fergus, are mysteries which we do not attempt to unravel or explain.
Perhaps these two took after their departed mother.  We know not, for we
never met her.  Certain it is that they did not in the least resemble
their undeparted father--except in looks, for McKay senior had been a
handsome man, though at the time we introduce him his good looks, like
his temper, had nearly fled, and he was considerably shrivelled up by
age, hard work, and exposure.  The poor man was too old to emigrate to a
wilderness home when he had set out for the Red River Colony, and the
unusual sufferings, disappointments, and hardships to which the first
settlers were exposed had told heavily on even younger men than he.

Elspie's love for her father was intense; her pity for him in his
misfortunes was very tender; and, now that he was brought face to face
with, perhaps, the greatest danger that had ever befallen him, her
anxiety to relieve and comfort him was very touching.  She seemed quite
to forget herself, and the fact that she might perish on the bleak
plains along with her father did not seem even to occur to her.

"It wass madness to come here, _whatever_," said the poor old man, as he
cowered over the small fire, which his son Fergus had kindled before
leaving, and which Elspie had kept up with infinite labour and
difficulty ever since.

The remark was made testily to himself, for Elspie had gone into the
surrounding bush, axe in hand, to find, if possible, and cut down some
more small pieces of firewood.  When she returned with an armful of dry
sticks, he repeated the sentiment still more testily, and added--"If it
wass not for Tuncan, I would have been at home this night in my warm
bed, wi' a goot supper inside o' me, instead o' freezin' an' starvin'
oot here on the plain among the snow.  It's mischief that boy wass
always after from the tay he wass born."

"But you know that poor Duncan could not guess we were to have such
awful weather, or that the buffalo would be so scarce.  Come now, dear
daddy," said the cheery girl, as she heaped on wood and made a blaze
that revived the old man, "I'll warm up some more of the tea.  There's a
very little left--and--and--it surely won't be long till God sends
Daniel and Fergus back to us with food."

Old McKay was somewhat mollified by her manner, or by the fire, or by
the prospect of relief held out, for his tone improved decidedly.

"Try the bag again, lass," he said, "maybe you'll find a crumb or two in
the corners yet.  It will do no harm to try."

Obediently poor Elspie tried, but shook her head as she did so.

"There's nothing there, daddy.  I turned it inside out last time."

"Wow! but it's ill to bear!" exclaimed old Duncan, with a
half-suppressed groan.

Meanwhile his daughter put the tin kettle on the fire and prepared their
last cup of tea.  When it was ready she looked up with a peculiar
expression on her face, as she drew something from her pocket.

"Look here, daddy," she said, holding up a bit of pemmican about the
size of a hen's egg.

The old man snatched it from her, and, biting off a piece, began to chew
with a sort of wolfish voracity.

"I reserved it till now," said the girl, "for I knew that this being the
second night, you would find it impossible to get to sleep at all
without something in you, however small.  If you manage to sleep on this
and the cup of hot tea, you'll maybe rest well till morning--and then--"

"God forgive me!" exclaimed the old man, suddenly pausing, as he was
about to thrust the last morsel into his mouth; "hunger makes me
selfish.  I wass forgettin' that you are starvin' too, my tear.  Open
your mouth."

"No, father, I don't want it.  I really don't feel hungry."

"Elspie, my shild," said old Duncan, in a tone of stern remonstrance,
"when wass it that you began to tell lies?"

"I'm telling the truth, daddy.  I did feel hungry yesterday, but that
has passed away, and to-day I feel only a little faint."

"Open your mouth, I'm tellin' you," repeated old Duncan in a tone of
command which long experience had taught Elspie promptly to obey.  She
received the morsel, ate it with much relish, and wished earnestly for
more.

"Now, you'll lie down and go to sleep," she said, after her father had
washed down the last morsel of food with the last cup of hot tea, "and
I'll gather a few more sticks to keep the fire going till morning.  I
think it is not so cold as it was, and the wind is quite gone.  They
have been away five days now, or more.  I think that God, in His mercy,
will send us relief in the morning."

"You are a goot lass, my tear," said the old man, allowing himself to be
made as comfortable as it was in his daughter's power to accomplish;
"what you say is ferry true.  The weather feels warmer, and the wind is
down.  Perhaps they will find us in the mornin'.  Goot-night, my tear."

It was one of the characteristics of this testy old man, that he
believed it quite possible for a human being to get on quite well enough
in this world without any distinct recognition of his Maker.

Once, in conversation with his youngest son and namesake Duncan junior,
he had somehow got upon this subject, not by any means in a reverential,
but in an argumentative, controversial spirit, and had expressed the
opinion that as man knew nothing whatever about God, and had no means of
finding out anything about Him, there was no need to trouble one's head
about Him at all.

"I just go about my work, Tuncan," he said, "an' leave preachin' an'
prayin' an' psalm-singin' to them that likes it.  There's Elspie, now.
She believes in God, an' likes goin' to churches an' meetin's, an' that
seems to make her happy.  Ferry goot--I don't pelieve in these things,
an' I think I'm as happy as hersel'."

"Humph!" grunted the son in a tone of unconcealed contempt; "if ye _are_
as happy as hersel', faither, yer looks give the lie to your condeetion,
_whatever_.  An' there's this great dufference between you an' her, that
she's not only happy hersel', but she does her best to mak other folk
happy--but you, wi' your girnin' an' snappin', are always doin' the best
ye can to mak everybody aboot ye meeserable."

"Tuncan," retorted the sire, with solemn candour, "it iss the same
compliment I can return to yoursel' with interest, my boy--what_ever_."

With such sentiments, then, it is not remarkable that Duncan McKay
senior turned over to sleep as he best could without looking to a higher
source than earth afforded for help in his extremity.  Happily his
daughter was actuated by a better spirit, and when she at last lay down
on her pile of brushwood, with her feet towards the fire, and her head
on a buffalo robe, the fact of her having previously committed herself
and her father to God made her sleep all the sounder.

In another clump of wood not many miles distant from the spot where the
father and daughter lay, two hunters were encamped.  One was Duncan
McKay, to whom we have just referred as being in discord with his
father.  The other was a Canadian named Henri Perrin.

Both men were gaunt and weakened by famine.  They had just returned to
camp from an unsuccessful hunt, and the latter, being first to return,
had kindled the fire, and was about to put on the kettle when McKay came
in.

"I've seen nothing," remarked McKay as he flung down his gun and then
flung himself beside it.  "Did you see anything?"

"No, nothing," answered Perrin, breaking off a piece of pemmican and
putting it into the pot.

"How much is left?" asked McKay.

"Hardly enough for two days--for the two of us; four days perhaps for
one!" answered the other.

McKay looked up quickly, but the Canadian was gazing abstractedly into
the pot.  Apparently his remark had no significance.  But McKay did not
think so.  Since arriving in the colony he had seen and heard much about
deception and crime among both Indians and half-breeds.  Being
suspicious by nature, he became alarmed, for it was evident enough, as
Perrin had said, that food to last two men for three days would last one
man for six, and the one who should possess six days' provisions might
hope to reach the Settlement alive, even though weakened by previous
starvation.

The dark expression which had procured for Duncan McKay junior the
_sobriquet_ of Cloudbrow from La Certe and his wife, deepened visibly as
these thoughts troubled his brain, and for some time he sat gazing at
the fire in profound abstraction.

Young McKay was not by any means one of the most depraved of men, but
when a man is devoid of principle it only requires temptation strong
enough, and opportunity convenient, to sink him suddenly to the lowest
depths.  Starvation had so far weakened the physique of the hunters that
it was obviously impossible for both of them to reach the Settlement on
two days' short allowance of food.  The buffalo had been driven away
from that neighbourhood by the recent storm, and the hope of again
falling in with them was now gone.  The starving hunters, as we have
said, had broken up camp, and were scattered over the plains no one
could tell where.  To find them might take days, if not weeks; and, even
if successful, of what avail would it be to discover groups of men who
were in the same predicament with themselves?  To remain where they were
was certain and not far-distant death!  The situation was desperate, and
each knew it to be so.  Yet each did not take it in the same way.
McKay, as we have said, became abstracted and slightly nervous.  The
Canadian, whatever his thoughts, was calm and collected, and went about
his culinary operations as if he were quite at ease.  He was about to
lift the pot off the hook that suspended it over the fire, when his
companion quietly, and as if without any definite purpose, took up his
gun.

Perrin observed the action, and quickly reached out his hand towards his
own weapon, which lay on the ground beside him.

Quick as lightning McKay raised his gun and fired.  Next moment his
comrade lay dead upon the ground--shot through the heart!

Horror-struck at what he had done, the murderer could scarcely believe
his eyes, and he stood up glaring at the corpse as if he had been frozen
to death in that position.  After standing a long time, he sat down and
tried to think of his act and the probable consequences.

Self-defence was the first idea that was suggested clearly to him; and
he clung to it as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw.  "Was it
not clear," he thought, "that Perrin intended to murder me?  If not, why
so quick to grip his gun?  If I had waited it would have been me, not
Perrin, that would be lying there now!"

His memory reminded him faithfully, however, that when he first thought
of taking up his gun, Conscience had sternly said,--"Don't."  Why should
Conscience have spoken thus, or at all, if his motive had been innocent?

There are two ways in which a wicked man gets rid of conscientious
troubles--at least for a time.  One way is by stout-hearted defiance of
God, and ignoring of Conscience altogether.  The other is by sophistical
reasoning, and a more or less successful effort to throw dust in his own
eyes.

Duncan McKay took the latter method.  It is an easy enough method--
especially with the illogical--but it works indifferently, and it does
not last long.

Conscience may be seared; may be ignored; may be trampled on, but it
cannot be killed; it cannot even be weakened and is ever ready at the
most unseasonable and unexpected times to start up, vigorous and
faithful to the very end, with its emphatic "Don't!" and "No!"

Dragging the body out of the camp, McKay returned to take his supper and
reason the matter out with himself.

"I could not help myself," he thought; "when I took up my gun I did not
intend to kill the man."

Conscience again reminded him of its "Don't!"

"And would not every man in Rud Ruver justify me for firing first in
self-defence?"

Conscience again said "No!"

Here the hunter uttered a savage oath, to which Conscience made no
reply, for Conscience never speaks back or engages in disputation.

We need not attempt further to analyse the workings of sophistry in the
brain of a murderer.  Suffice it to say that when the man had finished
his supper he had completely, though not satisfactorily, justified
himself in his own eyes.  There was, he felt, a disagreeable
undercurrent of uneasiness; but this might have been the result of fear
as to how the Canadian half-breeds and friends of the slain man would
regard the matter in the event of its being found out.

There was reason for anxiety on this head, for poor Perrin was a great
favourite among his comrades, while Cloudbrow was very much the reverse.

Having finished the supper which he had purchased at such a terrible
price, the young man gathered his things together, packed the provisions
on his back, put on his snow-shoes and left the scene of the murder.

Although a dark night, there was sufficient moon-light to enable him to
pick his steps, but he had not advanced more than two miles when he came
upon the track of a party that had preceded him.  This rendered the
walking more easy, and as he plodded along he reflected that the wolves
would soon find Perrin's body, and, by tearing it to pieces render
recognition of the victim impossible.

Suddenly it occurred to him that if any of the scattered band of hunters
should come on the camp before the wolves had time to do their work, the
print of his snow-shoes might tell a tale--for snowshoes were of various
shapes and sizes, and most of his companions in the Settlement might be
pretty well acquainted with the shape of his.  The danger of such a
_contretemps_ was not great, but, to make quite sure that it should not
occur, he turned round and walked straight back on his track to the camp
he had just left--thus obliterating, or, rather, confusing the track, so
as to render recognition improbable.  As he walked over it a third time,
in resuming his march to the Settlement, all danger on this ground, he
considered, was effectually counteracted.  Of course, when he reached
the tracks of the party before mentioned, all trace of his own track was
necessarily lost among these.

That "murder will out" is supposed to be an unquestionable truism.  We
nevertheless question it very much; for, while the thousands of cases of
murder that have been discovered are obvious, the vast number, it may
be, that have never been found out are not obvious, however probable.

The case we are now describing seemed likely to belong to the class
which remains a mystery till altogether forgotten.  Nevertheless Nemesis
was on the wing.

While Duncan McKay junior was thus pushing his way over the plains in
the direction of Red River Settlement, two poor half-breed women were
toiling slowly over the same plains behind him, bound for the same haven
of hoped-for and much-needed rest and refreshment.  The poor creatures
had been recently made widows.  The husband of one, Louis Blanc, had
been killed by Indians during this hunt; that of the other, Antoine
Pierre, had met his death by being thrown from his horse when running
the buffalo.  Both women were in better condition than many of the other
hunters' wives, for they had started on the homeward journey with a
better supply of meat, which had not yet been exhausted.

It happened that Marie Blanc and Annette Pierre came upon McKay's camp
soon after he left it the second time.  Here they prepared to spend the
night, but, on discovering marks of fresh blood about, they made a
search, and soon came on the unburied corpse of the murdered man, lying
behind a bush.  They recognised it at once, for Perrin had been
well-known, as well as much liked, in the Settlement.

Neither of the women was demonstrative.  They did not express much
feeling, though they were undoubtedly shocked; but they dug a hole in
the snow with their snow-shoes, and buried the body of the hunter
therein--having first carefully examined the wound in his breast, and
removed the poor man's coat, which exhibited a burnt hole in front, as
well as a hole in the back, for the bullet had gone quite through him.

Then they returned to the camp, and made a careful examination of it;
but nothing was found there which could throw light on the subject of
who was the murderer.  Whether a comrade or an Indian had done the deed
there was nothing to show; but that a murder had been committed they
could not doubt, for it was physically almost impossible that a man
could have shot himself in the chest, either by accident or intention,
with one of the long-barrelled trading guns in use among the
buffalo-hunters.

Another point, justifying the supposition of foul play, was the
significant fact that Perrin's gun, with his name rudely carved on the
stock, still lay in the camp _undischarged_.

"See--here is something," said one woman to the other in the Cree
tongue, as they were about to quit the camp.

She held up a knife which she had found half buried near the fire.

"It is not a common scalping-knife," said the other woman.  "It is the
knife of a settler."

The weapon in question was one of the large sheath-knives which many of
the recently arrived settlers had brought with them from their native
land.  Most of these differed a little in size and form from each other,
but all of them were very different from the ordinary scalping-knives
supplied by the fur-traders to the half-breeds and Indians.

"I see no name on it--no mark," said the woman who found it, after a
critical inspection.  Her companion examined it with equal care and
similar result.

The two women had at first intended to encamp at this spot, but now they
determined to push forward to the Settlement as fast as their exhausted
condition permitted, carrying the knife, with the coat and gun of the
murdered man, along with them.


CHAPTER FIVE.

SAVED.

Duncan McKay senior was dreaming of, and gloating over, the flesh-pots
of Red River, and his amiable daughter was rambling over the green
carpet of the summer prairies, when the sun arose and shone upon the
bushes which surrounded their winter camp--Starvation Camp, as the old
man had styled it.

There is no saying how long Duncan would have gloated, and the fair
Elspie wandered, if a hair of the buffalo robe on which the former lay
had not entered his nostril, and caused him to sneeze.

Old McKay's sneeze was something to be remembered when once heard.
Indeed it was something that could not be forgotten!  From the
profoundest depths of his person it seemed to burst, and how his nose
sustained the strain without splitting has remained one of the mysteries
of the Nor'-West unto this day.  It acted like an electric shock on
Elspie, who sat bolt upright at once with a scared look that was quite
in keeping with her tousled hair.

"Oh! daddy, what a fright you gave me!"  Elspie said, remonstratively.

"It iss goot seventeen years an' more that you hev had to get used to
it, whatever," growled the old man.  "I suppose we've got nothin' for
breakfast?"

He raised himself slowly, and gazed at Elspie with a disconsolate
expression.

"Nothing," returned the girl with a look of profound woe.

It is said that when things are at the worst they are sure to mend.  It
may be so: the sayings of man are sometimes true.  Whether or not the
circumstances of Elspie and old McKay were at the worst is an open
question; but there can be no doubt that they began to mend just about
that time, for the girl had not quite got rid of her disconsolate
feelings when the faint but merry tinkle of sleigh-bells was heard in
the frosty air.

The startled look of sudden surprise and profound attention is
interesting to behold, whether in old or young.  It is a condition of
being that utterly blots out self for a brief moment in the person
affected, and allows the mind and frame for once to have free
unconscious play.

Elspie said, "Sh!--" and gazed aside with wide and lustrous eyes, head a
little on one side, a hand and forefinger slightly raised, as if to
enforce silence, and her graceful figure bent forward--a petrifaction of
intensely attentive loveliness.

Old McKay said "Ho!" and, with both hands resting on the ground to prop
him up, eyes and mouth wide open, and breath restrained, presented the
very personification of petrified stupidity.

Another moment, and the sound became too distinct to admit of a doubt.

"Here they are at long last!" exclaimed the old man, rising with
unwonted alacrity for his years.

"Thank God!" ejaculated Elspie, springing up and drawing a shawl round
her shoulders, at the same time making some hasty and futile attempts to
reduce the confusion of her hair.

It need scarcely be said that this was the arrival of the rescue-party
of which Daniel Davidson was in command.  Before the starving pair had
time to get fairly on their legs, Daniel strode into the camp and seized
Elspie in his arms.

We need not repeat what he said, for it was not meant to be made public,
but no such reticence need trouble us in regard to old Duncan.

"Hoot!  Taniel," said he, somewhat peevishly, "keep your coortin' till
efter breakfast, man!  It iss a wolf that will be livin' inside o' me
for the last few tays--a hungry wolf too--an' nothin' for him to eat.
That's right, Okematan, on wi' the kettle; it iss yourself that knows
what it iss to starve.  Blow up the fire, Peter Tavidson.  You're a
cliver boy for your age, an' hes goot lungs, I make no doubt."

"That I have, Mr McKay, else I should not be here," said the lad,
laughing, as he knelt before the embers of the fire, and blew them into
a blaze.

"Wow!  Dan, hev ye not a pit pemmican handy?" asked McKay.  "It iss
little I care for cookin' just now."

"Here you are," said Dan, taking a lump of the desired article from his
wallet and handing it to the impatient man; at the same time giving a
morsel to Elspie.  "I knew you would want it in a hurry, and kept it
handy.  Where is Duncan?  I thought he was with you."

"So he wass, Taniel, when you left us to go to Rud Ruver, but my son
Tuncan was never fond o' stickin' to his father.  He left us, an' no wan
knows where he iss now.  Starvin', maybe, like the rest of us."

"I hope not," said Elspie, while her sire continued his breakfast with
manifest satisfaction.  "He went off to search for buffalo with Perrin
and several others.  They said they would return to us if they found
anything.  But, as they have not come back, we suppose they must have
been unsuccessful.  Did you meet any of the poor people on the way out,
Dan?"

"Ay, we met some of them," replied the hunter, in a sad tone.  "All
struggling to make their way back to the Settlement, and all more or
less starving.  We helped them what we could, but some were past help;
and we came upon two or three that had fallen in their tracks and died
in the snow.  But we have roused the Settlement, and there are many
rescue-parties out in all directions now, scouring the plains."

"You hev stirred it enough, Okematan," said old McKay, referring to the
kettle of food which was being prepared.  "Here, fill my pannikin: I can
wait no longer."

"Whenever you have finished breakfast we must start off home," said
Davidson, helping Elspie to some of the much-needed and not yet warmed
soup, which was quickly made by mixing pemmican with flour and water.
"I have brought two sleds, so that you and your father may ride, and we
will carry the provisions.  We never know when the gale may break out
again."

"Or when heavy snow may come on," added Peter, who was by that time busy
with his own breakfast.

Okematan occupied himself in stirring the contents of the large kettle,
and occasionally devouring a mouthful of pemmican uncooked.

An hour later, and they were making for home almost as fast as the
rescue-party had travelled out--the provisions transferred to the strong
backs of their rescuers--old McKay and Elspie carefully wrapped up in
furs, reposing on the two sledges.


CHAPTER SIX.

DISCORD AND DECEIT, ETCETERA.

It was found, on their arrival at the home of Duncan McKay senior, that
Duncan junior had got there before them, he having been met and brought
in by one of the settlers who had gone out with his cariole to do what
he could for the hunters.  The two women who discovered the body of
Perrin, however, had not yet arrived, and nothing was known of the
murder in the Settlement.

"It iss little troubled _you_ wass, what came over us," remarked old
Duncan angrily, on entering his house, and finding his younger son
engaged with a pipe beside the kitchen fire.

"An' how could _I_ know where you wass; efter I had been huntin' for
nothin' for two days?" retorted his son.  "Wass I to think you would be
stoppin' in the lame camp till you died?  Wass it not more likely that
some wan would find you an' bring you in--as they did?"

"No thanks to you that they did, Tuncan, what_ever_.  Where did you
leave the other boys?"

"How should I know?" returned the son sharply; "they dropped off--wan
here an' wan there--sayin' they would try for a buffalo in wan place or
another, or, that they would rest awhile; an' so I wass left by myself.
I found it quite enough to look efter number wan."

"It hes _always_ been as much, that, as ye could manitch, Tuncan, even
when things wass goin' easy," said the old man with a sarcastic laugh,
that induced the young man to rise and quit the room.

He went towards a small shop, or store, as such places were styled in
the Nor'-West.  It fell to his lot in the family arrangements to look
after and manage this store.  Indeed the youth's anxiety for the ease
and comfort of "number wan" had induced him to select the post as being
a part of the family duties that was peculiarly suited to himself.

On reaching the store he went straight to a large roll of Canadian twist
tobacco, cut off a piece, refilled his pipe, and, sitting down on a bale
began or, rather, continued to smoke.  He had not been seated long when
the door opened, and the head of a half-breed peeped cautiously in with
an uncommonly sly look.

"That you, Francois La Certe?" said McKay rather sternly, for he knew
the man well.  "What iss it you will be wantin' now?"

Francois wanted many things--things almost too numerous to mention; but,
first, he would pay his debts to Cloudbrow.

"Come, that's something new," said McKay with a cynical laugh.  "You
must have come by a fortune, or committed a robbery before ye would be
so honest.  How much are you goin' to pay?"

"The sledge that you lent me, I have brought back," said the half-breed
with a deprecatory air.

"So, you call returning a loan paying your debts?" said Duncan.

La Certe did not quite say that, but he thought it bore some resemblance
to a payment to account, and at all events was proof of his good
intentions.

"And on the strength of that you'll want plenty more credit, I hev no
doubt."

"No--not plenty," said La Certe, with the earnest air of a man who is
exposing his whole soul to inspection, and who means to act this time
with the strictest sincerity, to say nothing of honesty.  "It is only a
little that I want.  Not much.  Just enough to keep body and soul from
sayin' good-bye."

"But you have not paid a fraction of your old debt.  How will you be
expectin' to meet the new one?"

Oh!  La Certe could easily explain that.  He was going off immediately
to hunt and trap, and would soon return with a heavy load, for there
were plenty of animals about.  Then in the spring, which was near at
hand, he meant to fish, or go to the plains with the hunters, and return
laden with bags of pemmican, bales of dried meat, and buffalo-robes
enough to pay off all his debts, and leave something over to enable him
to spend the winter in luxurious idleness.

"And you expect me to believe all that nonsense?" said McKay, sternly.

La Certe was hurt.  Of course he expected to be believed!  His feelings
were injured, but he was of a forgiving disposition and would say no
more about it.  He had expected better treatment, however, from one who
had known him so long.

"A trip to the plains requires more than powder and shot," said the
store-keeper; "where will you be goin' to get a horse an' cart? for you
can hev mine no longer."

"Dechamp, he promise to sole me a horse, an' Mrs Davis'n will loan me a
cart," returned the half-breed, with lofty independence.

"Hm! an' you will be returnin' the cart an' payin' for the horse when
the hunt is over, I suppose?"

Yes, that was exactly the idea that was in La Certe's brain, and which,
he hoped and fully expected, to reduce to practice in course of time--if
Duncan McKay would only assist him by making him a few advances at that
present time.

"Well, what do you want?" asked McKay, getting off the bath.

The half-breed wanted a good many things.  As he was going off in the
course of a few days, and might not be able to return for a long time,
he might as well take with him even a few things that he did not
absolutely need at the moment.  Of course he wanted a good supply of
powder, shot, and ball.  Without that little or nothing could be done.
Then a new axe, as his old one was much worn--the steel almost gone--and
it was well-known that a trapper without an axe was a very helpless
creature.  A tin kettle was, of course, an absolute necessity; and the
only one he possessed had a small hole in it.  A few awls to enable him
to mend his bark canoe when open water came, and a couple of steel
traps, some gun-flints, and, O yes, he had almost forgotten a most
essential thing--twine to make a net, and some fish-hooks.

"It iss a regular outfit you will be wanting," remarked the
store-keeper, as he handed over the various articles.

O no--not a regular one--only a very little one, considering the length
of time he should be away, and the wealth with which he would return.
But again he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten something else.

"Well, what iss it?"

Some glover's needles and sinews for making leather coats and moccasins.
Needles and thread and scissors, for it was quite clear that people
could not live without suitable clothing.  A new capote, also, and--
and--a yard or two of scarlet cloth with a few beads.

As he made the last request, La Certe attempted to speak insinuatingly,
and to look humble.

"Come, that iss pure extravagance," said McKay, remonstrating.

La Certe could not, dare not, face his wife without these articles.  He
pleaded earnestly.  "Slowfoot is so clever wi' the needle," he said.
"See! she send you a pair of moccasins."

The wily man here drew from the breast of his capote a pair of
beautifully made moccasins, soft as chamois leather, and richly
ornamented with dyed quills of the porcupine.

McKay laughed; nevertheless he swallowed the bait and was pleased.  He
finally handed the goods to La Certe, who, when he had obtained all that
he could possibly squeeze out of the store-keeper, bundled up the whole,
made many solemn protestations of gratitude and honest intentions, and
went off to cheer Slowfoot with the news of his success.

It chanced that Antoine Dechamp, the very man about whom he had been
talking to Duncan McKay, had dropped in to see him and his spouse, and
was sitting beside the fire smoking when he entered.  Displaying his
possessions with much pride, he assured Dechamp that he had paid for the
whole outfit, and meant to return in the spring a rich man with means
enough to buy a horse and cart, and start with the buffalo-hunters for
the plains.

"You have a horse to sell--they say?" he remarked to his friend in a
careless way.

"Yes--and a good one too," answered Dechamp.

"Well, if you will loan him to me in the spring, I will pay for him when
I come back.  It takes all I have to fit me out to start, you see."

Dechamp did not quite see his way to that--but there was plenty of time
to think over it!

"Have you heard," said Dechamp, willing to change the subject, "there is
some talk that Perrin has been killed?  George McDermid was out, like
many others, huntin' about for the starvin' people, an' he came across
the wives of Blanc and Pierre--poor things! they're widows now, for
Blanc and Pierre are both dead.  Well, the women had well-nigh given in.
I had dropped down, they were so tired, and were crawlin' on their
hands and knees when McDermid found them.  I didn't hear all the outs
and ins of it, but there is no doubt that poor Perrin has been murdered,
for he was shot right through the breast."

"Perhaps he shot hisself," suggested La Certe.

"No--that could not be, for the women have brought his coat, which shows
that the ball went in at the breast and came _straight_ out at the back.
If he had shot himself he must have pulled the trigger with his toe,
an' then the ball would have slanted up from his breast to somewhere
about his shoulders."

"It was a Saulteaux, may be," said Slowfoot, who had been listening with
all the eagerness of a gossip.

"There were no marks of Redskins' snow-shoes about," returned Dechamp,
"an' the tracks were too confused to make them out.  A knife was found,
but there were no marks about it to tell who owned it--only it was a
settler's knife, but there are lots of them about, an' many have changed
hands since the settlers came."

At the time we write of, the colony of Red River of the north was in a
very unhappy and disorganised condition.  There were laws indeed, but
there was no authority or force sufficiently strong to apply the laws,
and discord reigned because of the two great fur companies--the Hudson's
Bay, and the Nor'-West--which opposed each other with extreme
bitterness, carrying fire-water, dissension, and disaster all over the
wilderness of Rupert's Land.  Happily the two companies coalesced in the
year 1821, and from that date, onward, comparative peace has reigned
under the mild sway of the Hudson's Bay Company.

But at the period which we describe the coalition had not taken place,
and many of the functionaries of the Hudson's Bay Company in Red River,
from the Governor downward, seem to have been entirely demoralised, if
we are to believe the reports of contemporary historians.

Some time previous to this, the Earl of Selkirk--chiefly from
philanthropic views, it is said--resolved to send a colony to Red River.
At different times bands of Scotch, Swiss, Danes, and others, made
their appearance in the Settlement.  They had been sent out by the
agents of the Earl, but there was a great deal of mismanagement and
misunderstanding, both as to the motives and intentions of the Earl.
The result was that the half-breeds of Red River--influenced, it is
said, by the Nor'-West Company--received the newcomers with suspicion
and ill-will.  The Indians followed the lead of the half-breeds, to whom
they were allied.  Not only was every sort of obstruction thrown in the
way of the unfortunate immigrants, but more than once during those first
years they were driven from the colony, and their homesteads were burned
to the ground.

There must have been more than the usual spirit of indomitable
resolution in those people, however, for notwithstanding all the
opposition and hardship they had to endure, they returned again and
again to their farms, rebuilt their dwellings, cultivated their fields,
and, so to speak, compelled prosperity to smile on them--and that, too,
although several times the powers of Nature, in the shape of grass
hoppers and disastrous floods, seemed to league with men in seeking
their destruction.

Perhaps the Scottish element among the immigrants had much to do with
this resolute perseverance.  Possibly the religious element in the
Scotch had more to do with it still.

The disastrous winter which we have slightly sketched was one of the
many troubles with which not only the newcomers, but all parties in the
colony, were at this time afflicted.


CHAPTER SEVEN.

VIXEN DELIVERED AND WOLVES DEFEATED.

With much labour and skill had the Davidsons and McKays erected two
timber cottages side by side in the land of their adoption.

These two families were among the first band of settlers.  They were
very different in character--one being Highland, the other Lowland
Scotch, but they were more or less united by sympathy, intermarriage,
and long residence beside each other on the slopes of the Grampian
Hills, so that, on the voyage out, they made a compact that they should
stick by each other, and strive, and work, and fight the battle of life
together in the new land.

All the members of the Davidson family were sterling, sedate, hearty,
and thorough-going.  Daniel and Peter were what men style "dependable"
fellows, and bore strong resemblance to their father, who died almost
immediately after their arrival in the new country.  Little Jessie was
like her mother, a sort of bottomless well of sympathy, into which
oceans of joy or sorrow might be poured without causing an overflow--
except, perchance, at the eyelids--and out of which the waters of
consolation might be pumped for evermore without pumping dry.  The idea
of self never suggested itself in the presence of these two.  The
consequence was that everybody adored them.  It was rather a selfish
adoration, we fear, nevertheless it was extremely delightful--to the
adorers, we mean--and doubtless not unpleasant to the adored.

The love of God, in Christ, was the foundation of their characters.

Of the McKay family we cannot speak so confidently.  Elspie, indeed, was
all that could be desired, and Fergus was in all respects a sterling
man; but the head of the family was, as we have seen, open to
improvement in many respects, and Duncan junior was of that
heart-breaking character which is known as ne'er-do-weel.  Possibly, if
differently treated by his father, he might have been a better man.  As
it was, he was unprincipled and hasty of temper.

Little wonder that, when thrown together during a long voyage--to an
almost unknown land--Elspie McKay and Daniel Davidson should fall into
that condition which is common to all mankind, and less wonder that,
being a daring youth with a resolute will, Daniel should manage to
induce the pliant, loving Elspie, to plight her troth while they were
gazing over the ship's side at the first iceberg they met.  We may as
well hark back here a little, and very briefly sketch the incident.  It
may serve as a guide to others.

The two were standing--according to the report of the bo's'n, who
witnessed the whole affair--"abaft the main shrouds squintin' over the
weather gangway."  We are not quite sure of the exact words used by that
discreditable bo's'n, but these are something like them.  It was
moon-light and dead calm; therefore propitious, so far, to Daniel's
design--for Daniel undoubtedly had a design that night, obvious to his
own mind, and clearly defined like the great iceberg, though, like it
too, somewhat hazy in detail.

"What a glorious, magnificent object!" exclaimed Elspie, gazing in
wonder at the berg, the pinnacles of which rose considerably above the
mast-head.

"Yes, very glorious, very magnificent!" said Daniel, gazing into the
maiden's eyes, and utterly regardless of the berg.

"I wonder how such a huge mass ever manages to melt," said Elspie--for
the human mind, even in pretty girls, is discursive.

"_I_ wonder it does not melt at once," said Dan, with pointed emphasis.

"What do you mean?" she asked, turning her eyes in considerable
astonishment from the berg to the man.

"I mean," said he, "that under the influence of your eyes the iceberg
ought to melt straight away.  They have melted my heart, Elspie, and
_That_ has been an iceberg, I find, till now."

He seized her hand.  It had all come on so suddenly that poor Elspie was
quite unprepared for it.  She turned as if to fly, but Daniel put his
arm round her waist and detained her.

"Elspie, dearest Elspie, it _must_ be settled now--or--."  He would
not--could not--say "never."

"O Daniel, don't!" entreated Elspie.

But Daniel _did_.

"Bray-vo!" exclaimed the bo's'n with enthusiasm, for he was a
sympathetic man, though unprincipled in the matter of eavesdropping.

That cut it short.  They retired precipitately from the weather gangway
abaft the main shrouds, and sought refuge in a sequestered nook near the
companion-hatch, which was, in name as well as in every other way, much
more suited to their circumstances.  The steersman had his eye on them
there, but they fortunately did not know it.

Apologising for this reminiscence, we return to the thread of our story.

Mrs Davidson was seated at breakfast one morning, with all her family
around her in Prairie Cottage.  She had named it thus because, from one
of the windows, there was to be had a peep of the prairies lying beyond
the bushes by which it was surrounded.

Old McKay had named his cottage Ben Nevis, either because the country
around was as flat as a pancake, or out of sheer contradictiousness.

"Have they found out anything more about the murder of that poor fellow
Perrin?" asked Mrs Davidson.  "More than four months have passed since
it happened."

"Nothing more, mother," said Dan, who now filled his father's chair.
"As you say, four months have passed, and one would think that was time
enough to discover the murderer, but, you see, it is nobody's business
in particular, and we've no regular police, and everybody is far too
busy just now to think about it.  In fact, not many people in these
parts care much about a murder, I fear."

"Ah if they went to see Perrin's old mother," said Jessie, "it would
oblige them to care a great deal, for he was her only son."

"Ay, her only child!" added Mrs Davidson.

While she was yet speaking, it so happened that Duncan McKay junior
himself entered the room, with that over-done free-and-easiness which
sometimes characterises a man who is ill at ease.

"Whose only child are you speaking about, Mrs Davidson?" he asked
carelessly.

"Mrs Perrin's," she replied, with a familiar nod to the visitor, who
often dropped in on them casually in this way.

The reply was so unexpected and sudden, that McKay could not avoid a
slight start and a peculiar expression, in spite of his usual
self-command.  He glanced quickly at Dan and Peter, but they were busy
with their food, and had apparently not noticed the guilty signs.

"Ah, poor thing," returned the youth, in his cynical and somewhat nasal
tone, "it _iss_ hard on her.  By the way, Dan, hev ye heard that the
wolves hev killed two or three of McDermid's horses that had strayed out
on the plains, and Elspie's mare Vixen iss out too.  Some of us will be
going to seek for her.  The day bein' warm an' the snow soft, we hev a
good chance of killin' some o' the wolves.  I thought Peter might like
to go too."

"So Peter does," said the youth, rising and brushing the crumbs off his
knees: "there's nothing I like better than to hunt down these sneaking,
murderous brutes that are so ready to spring suddenly unawares on friend
or foe."

Again Duncan McKay cast a quick inquiring glance at Peter, but the lad
was evidently innocent of any double meaning.  It was only a movement,
within the man-slayer, of that conscience which "makes cowards of us
all."

"Louise!" shouted Dan, as he also rose from the table.

"Oui, monsieur," came, in polite deferential tones, from the culinary
department, and the little half-breed maiden appeared at the door.

"Did you mend that shot-bag last night?"

"Oui, monsieur."

"Fetch it here, then, please; and, Jessie, stir your stumps like a good
girl, and get some food ready to take with us."

"Will you tell me the precise way in which good girls stir their
stumps?" asked Jessie; "for I'm not quite sure."

Dan answered with a laugh, and went out to saddle his horse, followed by
his brother and Duncan McKay.

"Rescuing seems to be the order of the day this year," remarked Peter,
as they walked towards the stable behind the cottage.  "We've had a good
deal of rescuing men in the winter, and now we are goin' to rescue
horses."

"Rescuing is the grandest work that a fellow can undertake," said Dan,
"whether it be the body from death or the soul from sin."

"What you say iss true--whatever," remarked McKay, whose speech,
although not so broad as that of his father, was tinged with similar
characteristics.  "It will be better to rescue than to kill."

This was so obvious a truism that his companions laughed, but Duncan had
uttered it almost as a soliloquy, for he was thinking at the moment of
poor Perrin, whose body had long since been brought to the Settlement
and buried.  Indeed thoughts of the murdered man were seldom out of his
mind.

Meanwhile, far out on the lonesome and still snow-covered prairie the
steed which they were going to rescue stood on a low mound or undulation
of the plain surrounded by wolves.  It was a pitiful sight to see the
noble mare, almost worn-out with watching and defending herself, while
the pack of those sneaking hounds of the wilderness sat or stood around
her licking their chops and patiently biding their time.

They formed a lean, gaunt, savage-looking crew, as they sat there,
calculating, apparently, how long their victim's strength would hold
out, and when it would be safe to make a united and cowardly rush.

One wolf, more gaunt and rugged and grey than the others, with black
lips and red tongue and bloodshot eyes, moved about the circle uneasily
as if trying to screw up its craven spirit to the sticking point.  The
others evidently regarded this one as their leader, for they hung back
from him a little, and kept a watchful eye on his movements.  So did
Vixen, the mare.  She kept her tail always turned towards him, looking
savagely back at him with her great eyes glittering, her ears laid flat,
and her heels ready.

Poor Vixen!  Elspie had given her the name when in a facetious frame of
mind, as being descriptive of the very opposite of her character, for
she was gentle as a lamb, tender in the mouth, playful in her moods, and
sensitive to a degree both in body and spirit.  No curb was ever needed
to restrain Vixen, nor spur to urge her on.  A chirp sent an electric
thrill through her handsome frame; a "Quiet, Vic!" sufficed to calm her
to absolute docility.  Any child could have reined her in, and she went
with springy elasticity as though her limbs were made of vivified steel
and indiarubber.  But she was getting old, and somehow the wolves seemed
to be aware of that melancholy fact.  They would not have troubled her
in the heyday of her youth!

An impatient howl from one of the pack seemed to insinuate that the grey
old leader was a coward.  So he was, but evidently he did not relish
being told so, for he uncovered his glittering fangs and made a sudden
dash at the mare.

With a whisk of the tail worthy of her best days, she lashed out behind
and planted both her pretty little feet on the ribs of the grey chief
with such a portentous whack that he succumbed at once.  With a gasp,
and a long-drawn wail, he sank dead upon the snow; whereupon his amiable
friends--when quite sure of his demise--tore him limb from limb and
devoured him.

This was a fortunate respite for Vixen, most of whose remaining strength
and pluck had been thrown into that magnificent fling.  Old Duncan, had
he seen it, would probably have styled it a "goot Highland fling."

But the respite was not of long duration.  Their leader formed but a
mouthful to each of the pack.

When done, they returned to encircle their victim again, lick their
chops, and wait.

Evening was drawing on, and a sort of grey desolation seemed to be
creeping over the plains.

A decided thaw had been operating all that day, rendering the snow soft.
If the mare had only known the advantage thus given to her, a
successful effort at escape might have been made.  When snow on the
prairie is frozen with a hard crust on the surface, the light wolf can
run easily on the top of it, while the heavy horse breaks through at
every stride and is soon knocked up.  The case is reversed when a thaw
softens the surface, for then the short-legged wolf flounders helplessly
in its depths, while the long-limbed and powerful horse can gallop
through it with comparative ease.  But the good mare, intelligent though
she was, did not consider this fact, and the wolves, you may be sure,
did not enlighten her.  Besides, by that time she was well-nigh
worn-out, and could not have made a vigorous run for life even over a
good course.

Gradually, a worthy lieutenant of the old grey chief began to show
symptoms of impatience, and the hungry circle closed in.  Vixen looked
up and whinnied slightly.  It seemed a pitiful appeal for help from the
human friends who had cared for her so well and so long.  Perchance it
was the last wail of despair--a final farewell to the green fields and
the flowering plains of memory.

Whatever it was, an answer came in the form of several dark specks on
the horizon.  Vixen saw them, and whinnied again in a decidedly
different tone.  The wolves also saw them, and moved about uneasily.

On came the black specks, increasing in size as they drew near.  The
wolves looked at each other inquiringly, moved still more uneasily,
appeared to hold a consultation, and finally drew off to a neighbouring
knoll, as if to await the result of this unlooked-for interruption, and
return to business when it was past.

The intelligence of the lower animals is great--in some cases very
great--but it does not amount to reason.  If it did, those wolves would
not have sat there, in the pride of physical strength and personal
freedom, calmly awaiting their doom, while Daniel and Peter Davidson,
Duncan McKay junior, Okematan the Cree Indian, another Indian named
Kateegoose, and Jacques Bourassin, a half-breed, came thundering down
towards them like infuriated centaurs.

At last they seemed to realise the truth that "discretion is the better
part of valour," and began to retire from the scene--slowly at first.

Vixen, recognising friends, trotted off with reviving strength, and a
high head and tail to meet them.  Seeing this, Dan, who led the party,
drew rein so as to allow the steeds to recover breath before the final
burst.

The wolves, with that presumption which is usually found to be the
handmaid of ignorance, halted, and sat down again to watch the progress
of events.  Fatal self-confidence!  They little knew the deep duplicity
of man!

"O you stupid brutes!" murmured Dan to himself, advancing in a somewhat
sidling manner as if he meant to pass them.  They evidently believed
this to be his intention until they saw the six horsemen turn their
steeds straight in their direction and charge them at full gallop with a
yell that drove rapid conviction to their brains.

Then, with tails between legs and ears flat they fled.  But it was too
late.  The horses scattered the soft snow with comparative ease.  The
wolves plunged through it with difficulty.  First to overtake them was
Peter Davidson.  He put the muzzle of his gun to the side of the grey
lieutenant, and shot him through the heart.  His brother Dan, selecting
another of the pack, pointed at the ear and blew out its brains.
Okematan, partial to the weapons of his forefathers, sent an arrow
through the ribs of a third, while Kateegoose transfixed a fourth.
Duncan McKay shot a fifth, and Bourassin knocked over a sixth at
comparatively long range, his horse being too poor or too tired to come
fairly up with the pack.

There was no wasting of powder, shot, or shaft in this affair.  Each man
was an expert with his weapon, and cool as the proverbial cucumber,
though considerably excited.  Loading as they ran, they fitted and shot
again, stretching six more of the enemy on the plain.  Then they pulled
up and suffered the rest to escape, being afraid to leave Vixen out of
sight behind them, for that happy creature, following and enjoying the
sport as long as she could, found that her powers were too much
exhausted to permit of her keeping up with the chase.

"She's not fit to travel another mile," said Dan, stroking her glossy
neck and allowing her to rub her nose affectionately on his shoulder.

"That iss true, whatever," assented Duncan.  "I think we could not do
better than camp on the nearest bluff."

This was agreed to by all.  Provision for one meal, it will be
remembered, had been prepared at Prairie Cottage in the morning.  A
hunter's meal, when properly divided, makes two or three average meals,
and a hunter's powers of endurance are proverbial.  Each man had his
blanket strapped to his saddle.  Branches of various kinds of trees make
a good mattress, and the air of the prairie is well-known to conduce to
appetite and slumber.

With such environment it is scarcely necessary to add that the hunters
enjoyed themselves, and that Vixen had a restful night, probably without
even a dream about hungry wolves.


CHAPTER EIGHT.

STIRRING EVENTS DESCRIBED.

The proverbial slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, and the well-known
uncertainty of all human affairs, received striking illustration in the
person and prospects of our hero, Daniel Davidson, not long after the
events narrated in the last chapter.

Up to this period the unfortunate colonists of the Red River Settlement
had led a life chiefly of disappointment and disaster.  Although
everything had been done for them by their patron the Earl of Selkirk
with the best intentions, the carrying out of his plans had been
frustrated by the feuds of the rival fur companies, the
misunderstandings and the jealousies of Indians and half-breeds, and, to
some extent, by the severity of the climate.  An open rupture took place
between them and the North-westers.  Encounters between the contending
parties occurred, in which several on both sides were killed, and at
last the North-Westers, attacking the settlers in force, drove them from
the colony and burnt their dwellings and homesteads.

Retreating to the north end of Lake Winnipeg, the colonists found refuge
at Jack River--three hundred miles distant.  From this place they were
ultimately recalled by the Hudson's Bay Company, which took them under
its protection.  Returning to Red River, the unfortunate but persevering
people proceeded to resume their farming operations.  But the prospect
before them was gloomy enough.  The lawless proceedings of the rival
companies had convulsed the whole Indian country, and the evil seemed to
culminate in the Red River Colony, to which retired servants of the
fur-traders, voyageurs, adventurers, and idlers gravitated as to a
centre; so that there was little prospect of their being allowed to
prosecute their agricultural operations in peace.

The dissensions at last became so great that a large proportion of the
new settlers, including many of the Scotch Highlanders, dispersed to
seek a precarious livelihood among the Indians, on the prairies
bordering the waters of the Missouri, or to sustain themselves and their
families by fishing in the distant lakes, and hunting on their shores.

On the advent of spring, however, most of these returned to the colony,
with renewed hope in agriculture, and set to work--every man, woman, and
child--to get some seed into the ground.

But at this point an event occurred which threw the colony into great
consternation, and induced vigorous action on the part of Lord Selkirk,
which was the first step towards more peaceful times.

The North-West party, consisting chiefly of half-breeds, had augmented
to upwards of three hundred warriors.  It would be more correct,
perhaps, to style them banditti; for they had penetrated through every
part of Rupert's Land, set law at defiance, pillaged and destroyed many
of the establishments of their rivals, and kept the whole country in a
state of ferment and alarm.

One band of these men, numbering between sixty and seventy, advanced
upon Red River Colony.  They were a motley crew, all mounted on
horseback and armed with guns, spears, tomahawks, bows, and
scalping-knives, besides which they were painted and plumed _a la
sauvage_, and were in the habit when rushing to battle, of yelling like
the Red-men whose blood mingled with that of the White-man in their
veins.

What was the precise intention of these men at this time it is difficult
to say, but it was not difficult to see that peace was not their object.

Governor Semple, of the Hudson's Bay Company, a mild, just, and much
respected man, was in charge of the colony at the time.

Daniel Davidson was engaged in a very important conversation with old
Duncan McKay at the time the formidable troop of North-Westers swept
through the settlements.  The old man was seated in the hall, parlour,
drawing-room--or whatever you choose to call it--of Ben Nevis House.  It
was an uncarpeted, unpainted, unadorned room with pine plank flooring,
plank walls, a plank ceiling, a plank table, and a set of plank chairs.
Ornament was dispensed with in the hall of Ben Nevis House; for although
Elspie would fain have clothed it with a little feminine grace, its
proprietor would not hear of such proposals.

"Stick as many gimcracks as you like about your own room, Elspie," he
had remarked when the first attempt was made, "but leave me my hall in
peace.  It iss quite pleased with it I am as it iss."

Opposite the door of the hall there was a large open fireplace without a
grate.  Doors all round the walls of the hall opened into the other
rooms of the establishment.  Above what would have been the mantelpiece,
had one existed, there was a row of tobacco pipes.  Old Duncan was a
great smoker.  Indeed he would have been almost unrecognisable without
his pipe.  He was smoking when Daniel Davidson visited him, in order to
hold the very important conversation to which we have referred.

"It iss as you say, Taniel," remarked the old man, frowning at his pipe,
which was not drawing properly.  "Marrit life iss more to be desired
than single blessedness, whatever, an' it is a my opeenion that you will
do more work with Elspie helpin' you, than by yourself.  When iss it you
will be wantin' to call me your father?"

The old man asked the question with a somewhat humorous smile, for he
was, to say truth, not a little proud of the staid, sensible, and strong
young fellow who aspired to his daughter's hand--besides, the pipe was
drawing well by that time.

"As soon as you like," answered Dan, "or, rather, as soon as Elspie
likes.  You see, things are beginning to look a little more hopeful now.
People who seem to know best--or seem to think they do--tell us that
the Nor'-Westers are beginning to see that a colony here won't interfere
in any way with their business; a good deal of seed has been sown, and,
if all goes well, we may look for a better year than we have yet had;
therefore I don't see why we should wait any longer."

"Your observations are ferry true.  There iss just wan little word you
mention that requires consideration," returned the old man with a brow
wrinkled so as to suggest profound sagacity of thought.  "You said `if
all goes well.'  But supposin', for the sake of argument, that all does
_not_ go well--what then?"

"Why, then," answered the young man with a laugh, "we shall be no worse
off than other people, who have to make the best of things as they find
them."

"No doubt--no doubt--that iss the true an' pheelosophical way to look at
the matter.  But don't you think, Taniel, that it would be as well to
putt off till our munister arrives?  I would not be havin' my daughter
marrit without a munister if I can help it.  An' you know his Lordship
has promised more than wance to send us wan.  He will not be long o'
coming now."

"Yes, a minister has been promised again an' again," returned Dan,
somewhat bitterly, "an' I suppose he will go on promising again and over
again, but I have not much faith in these promises.  The Earl has too
many agents who are not as true as himself.  I would rather not delay my
marriage on that account.  What ails you at Mr Sutherland?"

"Well, Taniel, I hev nothing to say against Muster Sutherland.  He iss a
ferry goot man--I will not be denyin' that, but--he iss not an ordained
munister."

"What of that?" retorted Dan.  "He is an ordained elder of the Church of
Scotland, and that is much the same thing.  And he is a good, Christian
man, respected by every one in the Settlement."

"Well, well, Taniel; hev it your own way," returned old Duncan with a
resigned look.  "Of course, it would have been pleesanter if he had been
a regular munister, whatever; but, as you say, my boy, `what of that?'
So, as things look a little more peaceable than they wass--though not
ferry much--I will be--"

He was interrupted at this point by the sudden entrance of Jacques
Bourassin with the astounding intelligence that a band of North-Westers
had gone up the Settlement to attack Fort Garry.

"Hoot! nonsense, man!" exclaimed old McKay, starting up and flinging his
pipe away in the excitement of the moment.

"No--not nonsense!" said Bourassin in broken English; "it be true.  I
knows it.  I come to say that we go to the fort to help them."

"Right, boy, right!" exclaimed the old man, hastily belting on his
capote.  "Fergus!  Tuncan!--Elspie! where are these boys?"

"In the stable, father.  I saw them just--"

"Let them saddle all the nags--quick," cried the old man.  "Taniel, you
better--"

He stopped; for Daniel had already run out to saddle and mount his own
horse.

In a few minutes a cavalcade of a dozen powerful young fellows, headed
by old Duncan McKay, and armed with guns, were galloping at full speed
in the direction of Fort Garry.

But before this cavalcade had set out, the rencontre at the fort had
already taken place, and been fatally decided.

The approach of the enemy had been announced to those nearest the scene
of action by the women and children of that part of the Settlement, who
were seen running about in frantic alarm trying to hide themselves, and
some of them seeking refuge in the fort.

Among these were two brothers named Sinclair.  One of them, Archie by
name, was a stout healthy fellow of twelve or thereabouts, the other was
a thin delicate boy of ten, whose illness, whatever it was, had reduced
him to skin and bone, taken all the colour out of his cheeks, and
rendered him quite unable to run or play like other boys.  They had
recently become orphans, their father and mother, who were among the
most recent arrivals, having died suddenly within a few weeks of each
other.  When the alarm of the threatened attack was given, the brothers
were amusing themselves on the sunny side of the cottage which had been
for only one year their happy home.

In a moment Archie took his brother on his back and scampered away with
him to a place near the river, and hid him in a hollow under the bank,
where they had been wont to play at grizzly bears and hunters.

Meanwhile Governor Semple, with several gentlemen and attendants, walked
out to meet the party of half-breeds and Indians, not to offer battle,
but for the purpose of parlance and conciliation.  It is admitted,
however, that Governor Semple committed a grave error of judgment in
allowing his small party to carry arms.  They numbered only twenty-eight
in all, and, being untrained, could have had no chance in an open fight
with such opponents.  If the Governor had gone out unarmed with only one
or two attendants, he would, it was thought, have appealed irresistibly
to the honour of the party.

As it was, when the Hudson's Bay party drew near they thought the look
of their opponents so suspicious that the Governor halted his men, and
they stood in a group as if in consultation.  Seeing this, the
half-breeds divided themselves into two bodies, and commenced firing
from behind some willows--at first a shot or two, and then a merciless
volley.  No fewer than twenty-one of the twenty-eight fell to rise no
more, among whom were the Governor himself; Mr Wilkinson, his
secretary: Captain Rogers, a mineralogist; Mr White, the surgeon; Mr
Holt, of the Swedish navy, and Mr McLean, a principal settler.

Indeed the whole party would have probably been killed and the settlers
massacred at that time, but for the courageous interposition of the
chief of the half-breeds, Cuthbert Grant, who, at the risk of his life,
stood between the settlers and their foes, only one of which last was
killed.

When old McKay and his party drew near to the scene, the massacre was
completed, and most of his little band--which had been slightly
augmented on the way up--turned right-about, and rode away to defend
their respective homes.

But the warrior spirit of old McKay and his sons had been roused.  They
refused to turn tail, and, in company with Dan and Peter Davidson, made
a furious charge into a detached party of the half-breeds which they
chanced to encounter.  They scattered them like sheep, though they did
not succeed in killing any.  Then they also wheeled round and galloped
back to their respective homes.

"Come, Elspie, tear," said the old man as he dismounted, "putt what ye
value most in your pocket an' come away.  The duvles are down on us, and
we are not able to hold out in Ben Nevis.  The settlers must choin
altogether, an' do the best we can to defend ourselves."

While he was speaking, the Highlander was busy stuffing some of the
smaller of his household goods into his pockets--amongst them a large
quantity of tobacco.

Meanwhile Fergus hastened to the stable to saddle Vixen for Elspie,
while the poor girl ran to her room and secured some small objects which
she valued--among them a miniature portrait of her mother, and a Bible
which the good lady had given to her a short time before her death.
There was no money, and no valuable documents had to be looked after, so
that preparations for fight were soon completed.

Now there was a member of old Duncan McKay's household who has not yet
been introduced to the reader, but whose character and influence in the
household were such as to demand special notice.  This member was an old
woman named Peg.  Probably this was an abbreviation of Peggy, but we
cannot tell.  Neither can we say what her surname was, for we never
heard it, and no one spoke of the old creature by any other name than
that of "Old Peg."

Although Old Peg was by no means feeble--indeed, judged by her
capacities, she might have been pronounced middle-aged, for she could
walk about the house all day, actively engaged in miscellaneous
self-imposed duties, and could also eat like a man and sleep like a
dormouse--she was, nevertheless, withered, and wrinkled, and grey, and
small.  Her exact age nobody knew--and, for the matter of that, nobody
seemed to care.

Extreme amiability and self-obliteration were the chief characteristics
of Old Peg.  She was silent by nature, and deaf as a post--whether by
art or nature we know not; probably both.  Well, no--on second thoughts,
not quite as deaf as a post, for by means of severe shouting she could
be made to hear.

Smiles and nods, however, were her chief means of communication with the
outer world.  When these failed, a yell might be tried with advantage.

No one of the McKay household ever thought of giving Old Peg anything in
the shape of work to do, for the very good reason that, being an
extremely willing horse, she was always working; and she possessed a
peculiar faculty of observation, which enabled her to perceive, long
before any one else, what ought to be done, and the right time to do it,
so that, when any one bounced round with the sudden intention of telling
her to do anything, Old Peg was found to have done it already, or to be
in the act of doing it.  It is almost superfluous to say that she
patched and mended the household garments, washed the most of things
washable, sewed the sewable, darned the sock, and, generally, did-up the
whole McKay family.  When not engaged in definite or specific work, she
had a chronic sock-knitting which helped to fill up and round off the
corners of her leisure hours.

Old Peg had been the nurse, consecutively, of Fergus, Elspie, and Duncan
junior.  She was now equivalent to their second mother, having nursed
their first mother to the end with faithful untiring affection, and
received from the dying woman a solemn commission never to forsake
Duncan senior or his progeny.

No sentiment of a religious nature ever escaped Old Peg, but it was
observed that she read her Bible regularly, and was occasionally found
asleep on her knees--greatly to the amusement of that irritable old
rascal, Duncan senior, and to the gratification of Elspie, who came to
the conclusion that the old woman must have learned well off by heart
such words as--"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do; do it with thy
might."  "Do good to all men as thy hand findeth opportunity."  "Be
clothed with humility."  "Trust in the Lord at all times."  Probably
Elspie was right, for she judged of people in the old-fashioned way,
namely, "by their fruits."  Her judgment of the two Duncans on this
principle, by the way, could not have been very exalted, but we cannot
tell.  She was much too loyal and loving a daughter and sister to give
any sign or opinion.

At the time of the sudden call to flight just described, the McKay
family had totally forgotten Old Peg in their hurry.  Elspie was the
first to miss her.

"Old Peg!" she exclaimed--almost screamed--while Fergus was assisting
her to mount Vixen, "where is she?"

"I'll find her," said Fergus, "and bring her on in the cart.  You be off
after father.  We've no time to lose."

"Be _sure_ you bring her, Fergus," said Elspie.

"All right; no fear!"

Thus assured, Elspie was about to gallop away after her father--who had
started in advance, to overtake and stop the Prairie Cottage family, so
that they might travel in one band--when the clatter of hoofs was heard,
and next moment Dan Davidson galloped round the corner of the house.

"I came back for you, Elspie," he said, pulling up.  "Why did you not
come on with your father?"

"I expected to overtake him, Dan.  You know Vixen is swift.  Besides, I
missed Old Peg, and delayed a few minutes on her account.  Is she with
your party?"

"No--at least I did not see her.  But she may have been in the cart with
Louise.  Shall I look for her while you gallop on?"

"No; Fergus has promised to find and bring her after us.  Come, I am
ready."

The two galloped away.  As they did so young Duncan issued from the
stable behind the house, leading out his horse.  He was in no hurry,
having a good mount.  At the same time Fergus came out at the back-door
of the house shouting, "Old Peg!  Hallo! old woman, where are ye?"

"Hev ye seen her, Duncan?" he asked impatiently.

"It iss seekin' high an' low I hev been, an' it iss of no use shoutin',
for she hears nothin'."

"I'm sure I saw her in the cart wi' the Davidsons," said Duncan.

"Are you sure?" asked Fergus.

"Weel, I did not pass quite close to them, as I ran up here for my horse
on hearin' the news," replied Duncan; "but I am pretty sure that I saw
her sittin' beside Louise."

"Hm! that accoonts for her not being here," said Fergus, running into
the stable.  "Hold on a bit, Duncan.  I'll go with ye in a meenit."

In the circumstances he was not long about saddling his horse.  A few
minutes more, and the brothers were galloping after their friends, who
had got a considerable distance in advance of them by that time, and
they did not overtake them till a part of the Settlement was reached
where a strong muster of the settlers was taking place, and where it was
resolved to make a stand and face the foe.

Here it was discovered, to the consternation of the McKay family, that
Old Peg was not with the Davidson party, and that therefore she must
have been left behind!

"She _must_ be found and rescued," exclaimed Elspie, on making the
discovery.

"She _must_!" echoed Dan Davidson: "who will go back with me?"

A dozen stout young fellows at once rode to the front, and old McKay
offered to take command of them, but was overruled and left behind.


CHAPTER NINE.

OLD PEG.

Meanwhile, accustomed to think and act for herself, Old Peg, on the
first alarm, had made up her mind to do her fair share of work quietly.

She did not require to be told that danger threatened the family and
that flight had been resolved on.  A shout from some one that
Nor'-Westers were coming, coupled with the hasty preparations, might
have enlightened a mind much less intelligent than that of the old
woman.  She knew that she could do nothing to help where smart bodily
exercise was needed, but, down by the creek close by, there was a small
stable in which a sedate, lumbering old cart-horse dwelt.  The horse,
she felt sure, would be wanted.  She could not harness it, but she could
put a bridle on it and lead it up to the house.

This animal, which was named Elephant on account of its size, had been
totally forgotten by the family in the hurry of departure.

Old Peg found the putting of a bridle on the huge creature more
difficult work than she had expected, and only succeeded at last by dint
of perseverance, standing on three or four bundles of hay, and much
coaxing--for the creature had evidently taken it into its head that the
old woman had come there to fondle it--perhaps to feed it with sugar
after the manner of Elspie.

She managed the thing at last, however, and led the horse up towards the
house.

Now, while she had been thus engaged the family had left, and the
half-breeds--having combined their forces--had arrived.

Ben Nevis was the first house the scoundrels came to.  Dismounting, and
finding the place deserted, they helped themselves to whatever was
attractive and portable--especially to a large quantity of Canada twist
tobacco, which old Duncan had found it impossible to carry away.  Then
they applied fire to the mansion, and, in a wonderfully short time Ben
Nevis was reduced to a level with the plain.  Another party treated
Prairie Cottage in a similar manner.

It was when the first volume of black smoke rose into the sky that Old
Peg came to the edge of the bushes that fringed the creek and discovered
that Ben Nevis had suddenly become volcanic!  She instantly became fully
aware of the state of matters, and rightly judged that the family must
have escaped, else there would have been some evidence of resistance.

Fortunately the old woman had not yet passed quite from the shelter of
the bushes.  She drew back with a degree of caution worthy of a
Red-skin, leading the horse with her.  When well out of sight she paused
for the purpose of meditation.  What was now to be done!  As we have
said, she possessed decision of character in an eminent degree.  She
never at any time had taken long to make up her mind; she was not going
to begin now, though the position was probably the most perplexing that
she had ever experienced.  Suddenly she raised her head and laughed.

In the circumstances it would not have been surprising had hysteria
seized Old Peg, but there was nothing hysterical in her nature.  Calm,
cool, calculating courage dominated her every thought and feeling, but
the idea of what she was driven to in her old age had tickled her fancy.
Leading the big cart-horse close up to a bank, she prepared to mount
him--having previously broken off a good strong switch from a
neighbouring bush.

Never before in her life had Peg mounted a steed of any kind whatever.
She knew the lady's position on horseback by sight, of course, but not
by practice.  To attempt it even with a side-saddle would have been
impossible; but Elephant was barebacked.  Fortunately he was fat and
broad, and without a visible back-bone.  Old Peg at once made up her
mind, and, climbing the bank, scrambled on his back in gentleman's
position.  It was more comfortable than she had dared to hope.

But now an unexpected difficulty met her.  Elephant declined to move!
She pulled at his bridle, and he turned sluggishly, but he would not
advance.  Peg administered a sounding whack with the switch.  She might
as well have hit a neighbouring tree.  Elephant's hide was like that of
his namesake, and he had no feelings to speak of that could be touched,
or hurt, or worked upon.

In this dilemma the old woman had recourse to a weapon with which her
broad bosom was at all times furnished.  She drew a large pin, and drove
the point into Elephant's flank.  The result was instantaneous.  Up went
his hindquarters, and Peg found herself sprawling on his bushy mane.
She held on to that, however, and, gradually working her way back,
regained her old position--thankful that she had not been thrown to the
ground.

Another result was that Elephant condescended to walk.  But this was not
enough.  Escape at such a pace was impossible.  Old Peg prodded him
again--this time on the shoulder, for she rightly conjectured that he
could not well kick up with his fore-legs.  But he might rear!  The
thought caused her to grasp the bushy mane with both hands and hold on.
He did not rear, but he trotted, and poor Old Peg came to the conclusion
that there were disagreeable novelties in life, even for her.

When Elephant at length burst out of the fringe of wood and gained the
track that followed the course of the river, she was immediately seen by
the plunderers, who laughed at the strange rider but did not follow her,
with the exception of one man--an Indian, painted and feathered,--who
started in pursuit, hoping, possibly, for an easy scalp.

He soon came close up, and, being armed with a bow, sent an arrow in
advance of him.  The shaft was well aimed.  It grazed the flank of
Elephant, inflicting a painful wound.  This woke up the old horse
surprisingly, so that it not only broke into a gallop, but set off at
racing speed as it used to do when young.  The Indian was badly mounted,
and gradually lost ground, whereupon he sent after the fugitives several
more arrows which all fell wide of the mark.

The change to Old Peg was as a reprieve from death!  The trot had almost
dislocated her bones, and shaken her up like an addled egg, and the
change to racing speed afforded infinite relief.  She could scarcely
credit her senses, and she felt a tendency to laugh again as she glanced
over her shoulder.  But that glance removed the tendency, for it
revealed the Indian warrior, in all his paint and feathers and streaming
scalp-locks, in hot pursuit, while the whiz of another arrow close past
her ear convinced our heroine that it was not a dream.

The jolting to which the poor old creature was subjected had disturbed
her costume not a little.  Her shawl came nearly off, and, holding on by
one pin, fluttered like a flag of defiance.  Her slippers, which were of
the carpet pattern, were left behind on the prairie to perplex the
wolves, and her voluminous hair--once a rich auburn, but now a pearly
grey--having escaped its cap and fastenings, was streaming out gaily in
the breeze, as if to tempt the fingers and knife of the pursuer.

A stern-chase is a long one, whether ashore or afloat.  Pursuer and
pursued went rapidly down the Settlement until they came in sight of the
band which had come to rescue Peg.  They received her with a wild cheer
of surprise and joy, which turned the Red-skin to the right-about, and
sent him back to his friends much faster than he had come.

On receiving his report, the half-breeds at once dashed off in pursuit
of the settlers, and did not draw rein until they reached the place
where the Scotchmen had made a stand.  The latter were greatly
outnumbered, at least in fighting men, but they showed such a resolute
front, that Cuthbert Grant, the half-breed leader, again interfered to
prevent bloodshed if possible.  After calming his men, and advising
forbearance, he turned to Duncan McKay senior, who was the settlers'
spokesman, and said--

"If you will go peaceably away out of the colony, we will spare you, but
if you show fight your blood be on your own heads, for I cannot restrain
my men much longer."

- I help - said firmly Gabriel -. Let the girl, and once we have, I will
myself to Esteban. - Dificilillo is found. Some time ago that I know
nothing of it. Surely those who say they are not to deprive us of disgust.
But I find out .... Veremos, Gabriel ... thinking about it. - And
the canons? And the cardinal? Do not oppose that the poor girl back
to Clavería - Bah! The thing happened long ago and few agree. Moreover,
the girl can take her to a convent, to be quiet and recogidita without
scandal anyone. - No, this is not, aunt. It is a cruel choice.

We have no right to save the poor at the expense of liberty. - Say good
- said the old --- after short reflection.

To me, that the monjíos never liked me much. Where better than on the
side of the family, to become the good example? Bring to the house, if
you are repentant and want peace.

In the first talk in the Clavería some of it, it starts the bun.

My son might pretend to shock, but I will settle the account.

Worth more that do not turn a blind eye to the rides that Juanito, the
nephew of Don Sebastian cadet, he cloister when my granddaughter
comes to the door.

The very silly dream match with none other than the Cardinal and his
daughter is general. Could well remember the poor tabernacle. As Don
Sebastian, lies, Gabriel. Nothing will tell if they manage to bring the
girl. And why had to say ...? Be kind to the charity, and they more
than anyone. Because in the end, believe me, Gabriel ... O people, nothing
more than men! V The people of premium hosting with stubborn silence
the least allusion to the reigning prelate. It was the custom in Clavería:
Gabriel recalled seeing the same thing in his childhood.

When speaking of the previous archbishop, that people used to gossip,
like all living in isolation, release commenting on the language's
history and its flaws . A prelate who died had no fear. Furthermore,
there was an indirect compliment to the archbishop and live your
favorites speak ill of the deceased.

But if the conversation came in the name of His Eminence reigns, all
silent, taking his hand to salute the hat, as if the prince of
the Church could see them from the palace immediately. Gabriel, listening
to his colleagues in the upper cloister, recalled the trial of Egyptian
funeral.

Were not in the truth of the prelates said, no one dared not publish
their faults, till death seizes them. It was more that dared to discuss
the disagreements between Mr. canons, to keep the list of those was greeted
in the chorus or verse and antiphon between looked like rabid
dogs biting around, or speak with astonishment of some controversy and
the Doctoral Worker argued in papers Catholics in Madrid for three years
about whether the Flood was universal or in part, responding to articles
four months later. Around Gabriel had formed a group of friends. We
were looking for, feel the need of his presence, experienced this
attraction, while remaining silent, they exercise those born to
men pastors.

In the evening they met in the rooms of the bell, leaving when the
weather was good, the gallery on the cover of Atonement. In the
morning, the gathering was in the house of the shoemaker who taught
gigantones, a sick man and yellowish, with eternal headache that
forced him to take several rolls to use as hankies turban.

It was the poorest of the Clavería. I had no job and taught the gigantones
unpaid, hoping to get the first square vacase, and much thanks to
the gentlemen of the town house to give free, given that his wife
was the daughter of a former servant of the cathedral.

The stench of the glue and the moist soil infested home with the
environment source of misery.

Fertility desperate poverty worsened. The woman, flaccid, with big sad
eyes and yellowish, presented the annual Alice Chaos gripped their udders
passed out. For the faculty glided along the wall with a melancholy hunger,
several Chicuelo huge head and thin neck, always sick and die
without ever, afflicted by strange ailments of anemia, for packages
that arose and disappeared in the face, and filthy scabs covering
his hands.

She worked for the shoe shops of the city without much progress. Since
the sun came his gavel sounded in the silence of the cloister. This event
only attracted labor profane all the unemployed and miserable
smelly room. Mariano, the _Tato_ and pertiguero also lived in the
cloister were most often found sitting in the ramshackle Gabriel
silletas the shoemaker, so low, they could touch the ground with
their hands and dusty red brick.

Many times, the ran to the bell tower to regular taps, but there is an
empty place manchador old organ and the vestry of people who came
attracted by the talk of the meeting between staff of the premium
often.

The purpose of the gathering was to hear Gabriel. The revolutionary and
wanted to silence the murmurings listened distractedly about the life
of the cult, but his friends wanted to know things that I'd run those
lands, with a curiosity of people locked up and isolated from the world.
To hear him describe the beauty of Paris or the grandeur of London, opened
their eyes as children who hear a fantastic story. The shoemaker, with
his head low, while their work, followed closely the relationship of
many wonders. All agreed as well as silent Gabriel.

Those cities are more beautiful Madrid. And you look to Madrid ...! So
the shoe, standing in a corner, ignoring the sick child, I listened
with surprise to Moon, encouraging her face with a pale smile hovering
at the woman through the misery of the beast resigned when Luna described
the luxury of the great ladies abroad.

All the temple servants felt their spirits removed hardened and
insensitive as the stone walls to these evocations of a distant
world that had never seen.

The splendor of modern civilization that they moved more earnestly
described the beauty of the sky in the sermons.

In the acidic environment of the dusty shack and saw develop in the
eyes of the imagination great cities, and candidly asked about
foods and customs of the people there, as if people believe in
different species.

In the evenings, at When the choir, while working only zapaterillo,
Gabriel, tired of the monotony of silent Claverie, down to the temple.
His brother, with the dip of wool, golilla white long stick, as a
former sheriff, was in the sentry cruise, to avoid the curious switch
between the choir and the altar. Two posters of old gold, with
Gothic letters attached to the pilasters, who announced he was excommunicated
speak loudly or make signs in the temple. But this threat of centuries
not impressed with the few people who attended the dawn after a pilaster
and talks to the servers of the cathedral. The afternoon light filtered
by the windows, stretched on the floor big iridescent spots. The priests,
when he stepped on the carpet of light appeared green or red,
depending on the color of the glass.

The choir sang the canons themselves in the sad loneliness of the temple.
Detonations sounded like the blows of the gates closed, giving way
to a cleric delayed.

At the top of the choir organ bargain occasionally interspersed in the
plain song, but sounded lazily, with faint, out of pure duty, and
seemed to regret his solitary effort in the shadows. Gabriel not just
flip the cathedral without being her nephew joined the dogcatcher,
abandoned his conversation with the waiter or the altar of errands
to the Secretariat of the town, who had fixed his seat at the door
of the Chapter House.

A Luna you enjoyed the mischief of _Tato_ , trust and neglect that
went by the temple, as if they were born in deprived him of any submission
of respect. The entry of a dog on the ships caused him joy. - Uncle
- moon told - you will see how I open layer. And by pulling the ends
of the jacket, can move towards and jumping with contoneos of
lidiador.

The animal, which were known to old looking for the exit door by the
most immediate, but the cut _Tato_ you step inside the house
pretending to pursue harassed, deal in the chapel chapel until,
cornered, he could walk a few kicks.

The pitiful barking disturbed the song of the canons, and _Tato_ laughed
while there, the gate of the choir, twisted good gesture Esteban,
threatened with the stick stick. - Uncle - said a naughty afternoon
dogcatcher - You know that cree the cathedral, you have not seen
things "happy" to have?

wink their eyes and with an accompanying gesture obscene gesture to
indicate they were anything more than 'happy' such things. - Me -
continued - I am interested in the jokes that allowed the former,
no one is beyond me. Come you, uncle, and have fun for a while. You,
as all who believe to know the cathedral, will have spent many
times with these things without seeing them.

The _Tato_, following the choir for its outer part, led to Gabriel ends,
opposite the door of forgiveness.

Under the grand medallion that serves as a backup to Mount Tabor,
Berruguete work, opens the chapel of the Virgen de la Estrella. -
Look at that image you, man.

Is there a well around the world? It is a gachí, a crazy guy to come
back to the men if they blink. For Gabriel, this was not a discovery.
From little known that image of beautiful and sensual woman with worldly
smile, body tilted, hip, outgoing and eyes an expression of joy
frisky, as if to dance.

The child in his arms, also laughed, and rebocillo missed the hand
of the beautiful as if to discover the chest.

The picture, painted stone, stewed and gold, has a blue mantle sown
with gold stars, which is what gives the title of Our Lady of the
Star. - That you have read so much, man, may not know the history
of this chapel, much older than the cathedral.

Here were the wool, weaving carder Toledo and his patron before the
temple was built, and only ceded the ground on condition that they
would be the absolute master of the chapel and she would do what
they came to win, as well as whole piece of the cathedral to the
immediate pilasters.

Those who brought this mess! In the days that were party to the
Virgin, not the canons that were repaired in the choir, and Rabelo, and
removed songs tiorbas troubled trades.

If the canons silence asked, replied that they were forced to shut the
precentor because they were in his house, much older than the cathedral.
Do you know this guy? - Yes, now I remember. Archbishop Losa Valero
sued them in the early eighteenth century. Look at his tomb at the
foot of the altar. He lost the lawsuit, died of chagrin, and he buried
it here for you insolent pisaran the wool after his death because
he had been defeated in life. The arrogance of these princes of the church
drove them more proud modesty .... But is all this is what I wanted to
teach - you'll see better things. Say goodbye to the Virgin. But look
you!

What a face! Adormilaos his eyes. The great jembra. I pass the time
looking. It's my girlfriend ... ¡The nights that I dream of it ...!
Advanced some steps towards the big door of the cathedral, to better
cover the ends around the exterior view of the choir. On the three holes
drilled or chapels which runs a belt of ancient reliefs, the work of
an obscure medieval imaging, representing scenes from the Creation.
Gabriel acknowledged his rude and contemporary sculptures from the door
of the Clock and the first works of the cathedral. - See you. Medallions
in the first, Adam and Eve are naked as worms.

But the Lord gives to Paradise. They have to dress for the world go by
and just watch what they do are with clothes. Watch the fifth
medallion to our right. What would the good humor guy that did that!
Gabriel looked carefully for the first time those reliefs forgotten. It
was the simple naturalism of the Middle Ages, the confidence with which
the artists represented their ideas lay in those days of idealism,
the desire to perpetuate the triumph of the flesh in every corner
of the monuments ignored mystics to testify that life had not died.

Eva was drop between trees, with their clothes in disarray, and Adam about
it, with a gesture of sexual madness, took the arm to dominate, and
mouth to beat his chest with such avidity, that the same could
kiss that bite . _Tato_ The proud to the surprise of his uncle. - Hey,
how are you? I have discovered that rolling on the church.

The gentlemen canons sing every day to the other side of that wall,
without suspecting that their heads are on such joys. And the glass,
man? You look good. At first many color blind, confused shapes, cuts the
lead stooge and not guess anything.

But I've spent entire afternoons studying, and I know the backwards.
They are stories, things that they painted of his time there
glassmakers, whose intríngulis has been lost, with no Christian who
can catch.

And identify windows of the second ship, which leaked the afternoon
light with a tone caramel. - See you there - continued dogcatcher -.

A man with red cape and sword climbs a rope ladder. In the window you
will find a nun. It seems a thing of the _Don Juan Tenorio_ representing
on All Saints. Beyond those two are in bed and people who called at
the door. Must be the same birds and that the family was surprised.

And in the other windows, you look good: in ball porridge, others without
clothes dryer that kills; things in order, from the days when
people had no shame and he was face up with ... and the other to air.

Gabriel smiled at the necedades to the vagaries of ancient art
inspired the dogcatcher. - Well, in the choir, man, there is also
something to see.

Here we go: it just trades and leaving the canons. Luna felt the
annihilation of admiration whenever entering the choir. That high
seating, work on one side of Philip of Burgundy and other Berruguete
you drunk with its profusion of marble, jasper and golden statues and
medallions. It was the spirit of Michelangelo that resurfaced in the
Cathedral of Toledo.

The dogcatcher considered low seating, ferrets Gothic reliefs in the
discoveries made by his unhealthy curiosity. The first stalls to-earth,
where the clergy sat lowest category, was half a century earlier in the
high chairs, but in these fifty years the art was the great leap from the
Gothic to the rigid and hard and suavidades taste of the Renaissance.
Maestre Rodrigo had carved at the time that Christian Spain, moved
to enthusiasm, attended the recent efforts of the Catholic Monarchs
to complete the Reconquest.

In the backs of the panels and friezes, carved fifty-four paintings
reproduced the main incidents of the conquest of Granada. The _Tato_
watched these planes no oak and walnut with droves of riders and
clusters of soldiers climbing the walls of cities blackberries. was more
concerned the arms of the chairs, the railings of the stairs leading to
the high chairs, the outgoing between the seats and used to lay
his head, covered with grotesque beings and animals: dogs, monkeys,
birds, friars and pajecillos, all in difficult positions, rare and
obscene.

Pigs and frogs are coupled in monstrous municipalities; monkeys with
ignoble gesture is twisting in the lubrication spasms, and intertwined
pajecillos sunk in position against the head on the cross road of
the companion.

It was a cartoon world of lust, simiescos gestures and shaking satiríacos,
which peeked carnal passion with the grin of the animal most
grotesque. - Look, man.

How funny, this is the most notable. _Tato_ And Gabriel taught the squat
figure of a friar, preaching to huge donkey ears. When they left the
choir, Gabriel saw about great fresco of St. Christopher's teacher
chapel. He had a close port immediately the colossus, which leads to a
staircase to the music file.

The artist wore under his arm a large book with dust caps, which showed
Gabriel. - I'll take it up.

And you shall hear something worth it. And to move your view of the port
libróte immediately exclaimed: - Oh, that file, Gabriel, what a shame da!
Every time I visit I leave sad. There have been barbarians. All the
music books have pages torn out, cut a point where there was painted
a bullet, something nice.

The old music sleep under the dust. Canons lords do not want it, do
not understand nor are able to dedicate a few pesetas to be heard in the
major parties. Les enough to muddle through with any piece Rossini,
and as the body, all that matters is who plays slow, very slow.

The more slowly, more religious, while the organist touches a habanera.
Still looking at the port of the file with melancholy eyes, as if
to mourn the demise of music. - And there, Gabriel, there are
remarkable works that should not die while in the art world there.

We are not profane music much, but you create that Spain is something
religious ....

It is understood that there really is whether profane music and religious
music, which I doubt, for me, there's only music, and I do not
know what the handsome tick removal, detailing where one ends and
another begins .... After the wall of the San Cristobal sleep mutilated,
with a shroud of dust, the great Spanish music.

Best to sleep. To hear what is sung in this choir! There is Christopher
Morales, who was a teacher for three centuries in the cathedral
chapel and twenty years before Palestrina began the reform of music.

In Rome he shared the glory with the famous master. His portrait is in
the Vatican, and its _Lamentaciones_, his motets, his _Magnificat_
sleep here forgotten for centuries. That Victoria ... Did you know? Another
from the same period.

Envious contemporaries called him 'monkey Palestrina, taking all his
works by imitators, after their long stay in Rome, but that you
created rather than to plagiarize Italian perhaps exceeded.

Here is Rivera, a teacher from Toledo that nobody remembers, and has on
file an entire volume of Masses and Romero de Avila, the best
studied singing mozarabic and Ramos de Pareja, a musician no less
than the fifteenth century , who wrote in his book _De Bologna
Tractatus_ music, and destroyed the outdated system of Guido of
Arezzo, discovering the "temperament of the sounds', and the monk
Ureña, adding _si_ note of the scale, and Javier Garcia, who in
reforming the past century music, introducing them to Italy (God
forgive him!)

, beaten path that we have not yet emerged, and Nebra, the great
organist Charles III, a man born a century before Wagner employed
in Spain musical dissonance.

Writing for the funeral _Réquiem_ Doña Bárbara de Braganza, presintiendo
the strangeness of instrumentalists and singers with their
revolutionary music, placed in the margin of _particellas_: "Please
note that this paper is not wrong." His _Letanía_ was so famous, copy
of the prohibited, under pain of excommunication, but futile work,
because today is excomulgarían who you will remember it.

Created you, Gabriel, that file is a pantheon of great men, but at last
vault, where no one brings. Then he added, lowering the voice: - The
Church has always been a little music lover.

To understand it and feel it should be born artist, and you know what are
all these people who are paid for singing in the choir ... without
knowing music. When I see you, Gabriel, smiling at the things
religious, I guess at how much her gesture was silent, and give
the reason.

I have been curious about the history of music in the Church, I have
followed step by step over the miserable plight of art, leading him
to worship the cross throughout the centuries. You have heard many
times of religious music, as if it were a separate thing, created by
the Church. It is a lie: there is religious music. The dogcatcher was
away when they heard that the chapel master of untiring loquacity when
he spoke of his art, tackled the topic of music. He had formed his
opinion on Don Luis, and told everyone in the upper cloister.

_guillati_ Was that he knew in his sorrows touch armónium without it happen
cheer to the poor Clavería with something danceable, as he asked the
niece of _Vara of plata_. The priest walked Gabriel and talking on the
quiet aisles. Were not more people than a bunch of people in the house
at the door of the sacristy and two women kneeling before the grate
of the altar praying out loud.

Began to spread in the shadows of the cathedral rapid winter evenings.
The first bats descend from the roof, hovering between the forest of
columns. - Music Church - said the artist - is a true anarchy. In the
church everything is chaotic. You create the unity of the Catholic
religion in all the land there is much to say. Christianity, to form
as a religion, not invented or a bad Melopea.

Take the Jews their songs and how to sing, a barbaric and primitive
music, is now known that if we taladraría ears. Outside of Palestine,
where Jews were not the first Christian poets, San Ambrosio, Prudencio
and others have adapted their new psalms and hymns to folk songs
that were in vogue in the Roman world, or to the Greek music.

It seems that this' Greek Music 'to mean a great thing, do you,
Gabriel?

The Greeks were so large in the arts and poetry, everything that bears
his name seems enveloped in an atmosphere of undeniable beauty. Well,
no sir, that the music should be a Greek cowbells.

The progress of the arts has not been matched in the life of mankind.

When the sculpture was a Fidias and had reached the summit, the paint
that went almost rudimentary still can be seen in Pompeii and the
music was a babbling child.

The script could not perpetuate the music were so many 'modes', such as
musical people, and almost all of it was up to the performer.

Unable to set the parchment on which sang mouths and instruments,
progress was therefore impossible.

Therefore there has been a renaissance for the sculpture, to painting
and architecture, and the emergence of new art from the Middle
Ages, they found the music on the same children who had failed to
leave the old world.

Gabriel nodded with head movements to the words of the master chapel. -
This was the early Christian music - continued Don Luis -.

Entrusted to the tradition of hearing and passed, the religious songs
were corrupted and disfigured. In every church he sang in different ways.
The music was a religious gibberish.

Mystics tended to drive hard, the hieratic, and St. Gregory in the
sixth century published his _Antifonario_ a centón all liturgical
melodies, purified according to him.

It was a mixture of two elements: the Greek, but eastern and flowers,
something like the current malagueña and Roman tough and serious. Grades
are expressed in letters, the tones were still Phrygian, Lydian,
etc..

And continued to the labyrinth of Greek music, but very lively,
with _fioritudes_, sighs and aspirations.

The centón was lost, and much regret that want to return to the old,
better believe it.
"You are talking in ruddles now, Muster Sutherland," said old Duncan,
who, having finished the drum-stick and its duplicate, was preparing his
pipe for action.

"It is not much of a riddle, Mr McKay.  I suppose you consider a man
with ten thousand a year rich, and a man with two hundred poor."

"Well, yes; I wull not be denyin' that."

"Well--if the rich man spends ten thousand and fifty pounds a year and
never has anything to spare or to lay by, is he not miserably poor--poor
in spirit as well as in purse?  For, at the end of the year his purse is
empty, and he is in debt.  On the other hand, if the man with two
hundred a year spends one hundred and fifty, gives away twenty, and lays
by thirty every year, is he not rich?"

"Ferry true, Muster Sutherland," said McKay, with a peculiar smile, as
he emitted his first whiff.  "I wull not be arguin' wi' you, for you
always get the best of it.  Nevertheless, it is my opeenion that we've
had treebulation enough in Rud Ruver since we came oot, an' I would be
ferry gled of a luttle prosperity now--if only by way of a pleesant
change."

Recurring to this subject a few days later, young Morel asked Dan
Davidson, while they were paddling back to camp together one evening
with the proceeds of a day's hunt: "Has your life in the colony, since
the beginning, been as bad as old McKay made it out the other day?"

"Well, making due allowance for the old man's use of strong language,
his account of matters has not been much overdrawn," answered Dan, who,
in virtue of his superior canoe-craft, acted the part of steersman.
"You see, when we came out here we expected, like you, that all would be
plain sailing, except as regarded climate and ordinary difficulties, but
our eyes were soon opened to the true state of things.  Instead of the
wilderness, with a few peaceful inhabitants living under the mild sway
of the Hudson Bay Company, we found another company, apparently as
strong as the Hudson's Bay one, in violent opposition.  They regarded
our coming as likely to ruin their trade, for Lord Selkirk was a share
holder in the Hudson's Bay Company, and it was supposed his object in
planting the colony was to advance his scheme of monopolising the whole
fur-trade of the Far West.  I cannot myself see how this colony could
injure the fur-trade; but, anyhow, I know that the opposition has
affected the colonists very severely, for we have been deceived by the
contending parties, and misled, and delayed or thwarted in all our
operations.

"At the very outset, on our arrival, a band of the Nor'-Westers,
composed of half-breeds and Indians, warned us that our presence was
unwelcome, and tried to frighten us away by their accounts of the savage
nature of the natives.  Then the fear of perishing for want of food
induced a lot of us to take their advice, leave the farms allotted to
us, and go to a place called Pembina, about seventy miles distant from
the colony, there to spend the long and hard winter in tents, according
to the Indian fashion, and live on the produce of the chase."

"I should have thought that was a pleasant way of spending the first
winter," remarked Andre Morel, who, besides being young, was strong and
enthusiastic.

"So thought some of us at first," returned Dan, "but when we found that
the thermometer fell to somewhere between 40 and 50 degrees below zero;
that walking in snow-shoes, trapping, hunting buffalo, and shooting,
were not to be learned in a few days; and when we saw our women and
children dependent sometimes on the charity of Indians, and reduced
almost to starvation, we changed our minds as to the pleasure of the
thing.  However, if the school was rough, it made the scholars all the
quicker, and now I think that most of us are equal to the Redskins
themselves at their own work.

"When that winter came to an end," continued Dan, "we returned to Red
River, in the month of May, wiser men, thoroughly determined to plant
and sow, and make ourselves independent of the savages.  But hunger
followed us, for fish were scarce that season; so were roots and
berries; and, if it had not been for a kind of parsnip which grows wild
in the plains, and a species of eatable nettle, I do believe some of us
would have gone under altogether."

"And did your first sowing turn out well?" asked the young Swiss, who
having been bred a watchmaker, had only hazy notions as to farming.

"Ay, there was a gleam of prosperity there that led us to hope great
things for the future," answered Dan; "but the gleam did not continue.
Why, one fellow, not far from our place, sowed four quarts of wheat, and
reaped twelve and a half bushels; but we had terrible trouble to save
our crops from the birds.  In the Spring and Fall, blackbirds and wild
pigeons pass over the prairies on their way north or south, in immense
numbers.  They pass in such numbers that they could, I do believe,
swallow our whole harvest, if they got only a grain a-piece.  The
berries failed them that year, an' men, women, and children had to work
hard wi' guns, bird-nets, and rattles, from morning to night, to say
nothing o' scarecrows.  We had resolved never to go near Pembina again,
but what we saved of the harvest was little more than enough for seed,
so we were forced to try it for another winter.  Troubles again awaited
us there.  The half-breeds and Indians--who had been kind at first--
became jealous.  A plot was discovered to murder two of our party who
had undertaken to hunt, so we were obliged to buy our provisions at a
high price, and even to barter away our clothing to avoid starvation,
and we returned half-naked to the Settlement the following spring.
Then, coming upon us in armed bands and superior numbers, they drove us
out of the Settlement altogether at last, and we came here to Jack River
to spend the winter as we best could.  After that we went back and
struggled on for some time, but now, here have they a second time
banished us!  What the end is to be, who can tell?"

"Truly, if such be the country I have come to, I will go back to my
native land and make watches," remarked the Swiss in a tone from which
the sanguine element had almost entirely disappeared.


CHAPTER TWELVE.

ROUND THE CAMP-FIRES.

Had any one been watching the camp-fires of the banished colonists that
night, the last idea that would have entered the observer's mind would
have been that of suffering or distress.

The night was brilliantly fine, and just cold enough to make the blazing
fires agreeable without being necessary--except, indeed, as a means of
cooking food.  The light of these fires, shining through the green,
yellow, and golden foliage, and illuminating the sunburnt faces of men,
women, and children, gave to the scene a strain of the free, the wild,
and the romantic, which harmonised well with the gypsy-like appearance
of the people, and formed a ruddy contrast to the pure cold light of the
innumerable stars overhead, which, with their blue-black setting, were
reflected in the neighbouring lake.

Over every fire pots and kettles were suspended from tripods, or rested
on the half-burned logs, while impaled wild-fowl roasted in front of it.
Food being in great abundance, hearts were light in spite of other
adverse circumstances, and men and women, forgetting to some extent the
sufferings of the past and the dark prospects of the future, appeared to
abandon themselves to the enjoyment of the present.

The children, of course, were full of glee, and not altogether empty of
mischief; and there were fortunately no infants of age so tender as to
induce a squalling protest against the discomforts of a situation which
could be neither understood nor appreciated.

"It iss a pleesant night, whatever," remarked old McKay, lighting his
pipe with a brand plucked from the fire which his family and the
Davidsons shared in common; "an' if it wass always like this, it iss
myself that would not object to be a rud savitch."

"I don't know that a rud savitch is much worse than a white wan,"
growled Duncan junior, in an under-tone.

"What iss that you say?" demanded the old man with a look of suspicion,
for his hearing was imperfect.

"Surely the water must be boiling now, daddy?" said Elspie, by way of
checking the conversation.

"I don't know whuther it iss boilin' or not," answered Duncan senior,
applying another brand to his pipe.

"Archie, boy!" exclaimed Dan Davidson, "you're letting that goose roast
to a cinder."

"No, Dan, I'm not--but Billie can't a-bear meat underdone, so it's
better to blacken the outside than have the inside raw."

"Who iss that singing?  Wheesht, boys," said Fergus McKay, turning his
head a little on one side as if to listen.

There was profound silence for a few moments as a rich manly voice was
heard to swell forth from the neighbourhood of one of the camp-fires.

"It comes from the camp of the Switzers, I think," said Elspie McKay.

"I know it," said Jessie Davidson, who was seated on a log beside her
friend.  "It is Francois La Certe.  He came to our meeting-place in Red
River, you know, just after Cuthbert Grant and his men left us, and,
hearing that we were starting off to Jack River again, he resolved to
follow.  I heard him tell Slowfoot to get ready to go along with us."

"I wonder why he came?" said Mrs Davidson, coming out of her tent at
the moment, and joining the party round the fire.

"He did not say," answered Jessie.

"He did not require to say," remarked Duncan McKay, with a sarcastic
laugh.  "Every wan knows that wherever there iss a chance of gettin'
ammunition and plenty of victuals for nothing, there La Certe iss
certain to be found.  He knew that we would be sure to hev plenty at
this season o' the year, an' that we would not see him an' his wife
sterve when our kettles wass full.  Iss not that so, Okematan?  You know
him best."

Thus appealed to, the Indian, whose usual expression was one of intense
gravity, shut his eyes, opened his mouth, displayed his superb teeth,
and uttered a low chuckle, but made no further reply.

It was enough.  Those who understood Okematan and his ways were well
aware that he thought La Certe uncommonly sly.

The half-breed had indeed followed the expelled colonists in the belief
that they would certainly possess plenty of powder and shot--which he
had not the means of purchasing.  He also knew that the whole of
Rupert's Land swarmed with game in autumn and spring, and that the
Scotch were an open-handed race when approached in the right way.
Putting these things together, he carefully gummed his canoe, put his
wife and child into it--also some of the provision which had been
supplied to him by Duncan McKay junior--and followed the settlers over
Lake Winnipeg to Jack River.

Here, finding that a new party of immigrants had arrived, who were
necessarily unacquainted with his little peculiarities, La Certe
attached himself to them and made himself agreeable.  This he could do
very well, for the Switzers understood his bad French, as well as his
good tuneful voice, and appreciated his capacity for telling a story.

"Did you never," he said to Andre Morel, after his song was finished,
"hear of how my old mother saved her whole tribe from death one time in
the Rocky Mountains?"

"Never," Morel replied with a somewhat sceptical but good-natured smile.

"No!  I wonder much, for every one in this land heard about it, an' I
thought the news must have spread over Europe and--and, perhaps Africa.
Well, I will tell you.  Where is my baccy-bag?"

"Never mind, fill your pipe from mine," said Morel, tossing him a little
bag of the coveted weed.

"Thank you.  Well, you must know that my mother had a beautiful voice--
O! much more beautiful than mine.  Indeed, I do not joke, so you need
not laugh.  It was so sweet that men were always forced to listen till
she was done.  They could not help it."

"Did they ever want to help it?" asked Morel quietly.

"O yes--as you shall hear.  Well, one day my mother was living with all
our tribe--I say _our_ tribe because my mother was an Indian--with all
our tribe, in a great dark gorge of the Rocky Mountains.  The braves had
gone out to hunt that day, but my mother stayed behind with the women
and children.  I was a little foolish child at that time--too young to
hunt or fight.  My father--a French Canadian--he was dead.

"We knew--my mother and I--that the braves would be home soon.  We
expected them every minute.  While we were waiting for them, my mother
went into the bush to pick berries.  There she discovered a war-party of
our enemies.  They were preparing to attack our village, for they knew
the men were away, and they wanted the scalps of the women and children.
But they did not know the exact spot where our wigwams were pitched,
and were just going, after a feed, to look for it.

"My mother ran home with the news, and immediately roused the camp, and
made them get ready to fly to meet the returning men.

"`But, my daughter,' said an old chief, who had stayed in camp, `our
enemies are young and active; they will quickly overtake us before we
meet our men.'

"`No,' said my mother, `I will stop them.  Get ready, and set off
quickly.'

"She then ran back on her trail--my mother was a tremendous runner--
superb!  She came to a narrow place where our enemies would have to
pass.  A very thick tree grew there.  She climbed it, and hid among the
branches.  It projected beyond a precipice and overhung a stream.  Soon
after that she saw the enemy advancing, step by step, slowly,
cautiously, like men who dread an ambush, and with glances quick and
solemn from side to side, like men who see a foe in every stump and
stone."

La Certe paused at this point.  He was an adept at story-telling.  His
voice had slowed by degrees and become increasingly deep and solemn as
he proceeded.

"Now," continued he, in a higher tone, "my mother did not fear that they
would see her if they looked up when they passed the tree.  She was too
well hidden for that; but she was not sure what the effect of her voice
would be, for she had never tried it in that way before.  However, she
was full of courage.  She resembled me in that--bold as a lion!  She
began to sing.  Low and soft at the beginning, like a dream of song.

"At the first note the Indians halted--every man; each in the position
in which he was fixed.  If a foot was up he kept it up.  If both feet
were down he left them down.  The feet that were up came slowly to the
ground when the Indians got tired, but no one took another step.  My
mother's voice was a weird voice.  It sounded as if the place from which
it came was nowhere--or anywhere--or everywhere!  Slowly the painted
heads turned from side to side as far as they could go, and the glaring
eyes turned a little further.  A creeping fear came over them.  They
trembled.  They turned pale.  That could be easily seen through the
paint.  My mother saw it!  She became more courageous and sang out in
her most pathetic strain.  The Indians wept.  That was quite visible.
My mother saw it.  Her great object was to delay the attack until our
men had time to arrive.  She tried a war-song, but that was not so
successful.  It was too commonplace.  Besides, in her energy she shook
the branches, and that drew attention to the tree.  My mother thought
that she was in danger then; but fortune favoured her.  It always
favours the brave.  I know this from experience.

"She had just come to a terrific whoop in the war-song when she slipped
off her branch and the whoop increased to a death-yell as she went
crashing headlong through the branches and down into the stream at the
foot of the precipice.

"Water! water!" exclaimed La Certe at this point, holding out both
hands.  "I can never pass this part of my story without burning thirst!"

A mug of water was handed him.

"Poor fellow--have some brandy in it," said a sympathetic hearer,
hastily getting out his bottle.

La Certe held out his mug impatiently for the brandy, drained the mug,
and cleared his voice.

"Was--was your mother killed?" asked the sympathiser, earnestly.

"Killed?  No.  Impossible!  My mother could not be killed because her
destiny was not yet fulfilled.  No: there was a deep pool right under
the tree.  She fell into that with a plunge that echoed from cliff to
cliff.  The Indians were profoundly superstitious.  All Indians are not
so, but these Indians were.  They waited not for more.  They turned and
fled as if all the evil spirits in the Rocky Mountains were chasing
them.  They reached their wigwams breathless, and told their squaws that
one of the spirits of a mountain stream had sat among the branches of a
tree and sung to them.  It had told them that the right time for
attacking their foes had not yet come.  Then it sang them a war-song
descriptive of their final victory, and, just after uttering a
tremendous war-whoop, it had dived back into its native stream."

"Well done!" exclaimed an enthusiastic Canadian.

"But what became of your mother?" asked Morel.

"Oh! she swam ashore.  My mother was a splendid swimmer.  I know it, for
she taught me."

"Was it a long swim?" asked a sceptical sailor, who was one of the
emigrants.

"How?--what mean you?" demanded La Certe, sternly.

"I only want to know if she took long to swim ashore out o' that pool,"
said the sceptic, simply.

La Certe cast on him a glance of suspicion, and replied that his mother
had found no difficulty in getting out of the pool.

"Is the old lady alive yet?" asked the pertinacious sceptic.

"Of course not.  She died long long ago--thirty years ago."

"What! before you was born?  That's strange, isn't it?"

"No, but you not understand.  I suppose my speech is not plain to you.
I said _three_ years ago."

"Ah! that's more like it.  I only missed what you said," returned the
sceptic, whose name was Fred Jenkins, "for I've lived a while in France,
and understand your lingo pretty well.  Pass that goose, Morel, if you
have left anything on it.  This air o' the wilderness beats the air o'
the sea itself for givin' a fellow a twist."

The remarks of Jenkins, while they did not absolutely destroy the
confidence of the Swiss party, shook it enough to show the wily
half-breed that he must do something if possible to re-establish his
credit.  He therefore volunteered another song, which was gladly
accepted and highly appreciated; for, as we have said, La Certe
possessed a really good and tuneful voice, and these immigrants were a
musical people.

While this was going on at the Swiss camp-fires an incident occurred at
the fire round which the McKay-Davidson party was assembled, which
deserves particular notice.

Old McKay was giving some directions to Fergus; Duncan junior was seated
opposite Dan Davidson, smoking his pipe, and Elspie had gone into her
tent, when Slowfoot, the spouse of La Certe, drew near.

"Come along, old girl," exclaimed McKay senior.  "It iss some baccy you
will be wantin', I'll wager."

Slowfoot did not reply in words, but the smile upon her face was
eloquent.

"Come away, then," continued the hospitable Highlander.  "You shall hev
a pipe of it, whatever."

He handed her a large plug of tobacco, and the woman, sitting down close
to young Duncan, produced her pipe, and drew out a knife for the purpose
of cutting up the tobacco.

"Hallo!" exclaimed Duncan, "where did you get hold o' my knife?"

He stopped abruptly--a little confused in spite of himself.  For the
moment he had quite forgotten that the knife had been left in the camp
where he had slain Perrin, and the sudden sight of it had thrown him off
his guard.  It was now too late to unsay the words, but not too late to
mislead his hearers.

"I got it from Marie Blanc," said Slowfoot with a look of surprise.
"Does the knife belong to Cloudbrow?"

"I think it does.  I'm almost sure it iss mine.  Let me see it,"
returned Duncan, taking the knife from the woman's hand, and examining
it with cool and critical deliberation.

"No," continued he, "it iss not mine, but very like one that I lost--so
like that I felt sure at first it wass mine."

Men who lie, usually overact their part.  Duncan glanced suspiciously at
Dan to see how he took the explanation as he returned the knife to
Slowfoot, and Dan observed the glance, as being uncalled for--
unnatural--in the circumstances.

Dan was by no means of a suspicious nature, nevertheless the glance
haunted him for many a day after that.  Suspicion once aroused is a
ghost which is not easily laid.  He tried to shake it off, and he
carefully, loyally, kept it confined in his own breast; but, do what he
would, he could not banish entirely from his mind that Duncan McKay--the
brother of his Elspie--had some sort of guilty knowledge of the murder
of poor Henri Perrin.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

DIFFICULTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS OVERCOME.

When the bright warm days and cool starry nights of the Indian summer
gave place to the sharp days and frosty nights of early winter--when
young ice formed on the lakes and rendered canoeing impossible, and the
ducks and geese had fled to warmer climes, and the Frost King had sent
his first messengers of snow to cover the wilderness with a
winding-sheet and herald his return to the Winter Palace--then it was
that the banished Red River settlers began to feel the pinch of poverty
and to understand the full extent of the calamity that had befallen
them.

We have not space to follow them through all the details of that winter
at Jack River.  Some died, all suffered more or less; but they had to
endure it, for escape from the country to the civilised world was even
more difficult and hopeless than escape from the dreaded wilds of
Siberia.  The men hunted, fished under the ice, trapped, and sustained
themselves and their families in life during the long, dreary winter;
the only gain being that they became more or less expert at the
Red-man's work and ways of life.

Only two of the Indians remained with them to help them over their
difficulties--namely, Okematan and Kateegoose, with their respective
squaws.  These last were invaluable as the makers of moccasins and
duffle socks and leathern coats, without which existence in such a
climate would have been impossible.  They also imparted their knowledge
in such matters to the squaws of the white men.

There was one friend, however, who did not remain with the settlers when
things began to look dismal around them.  This was the amiable, musical,
story-telling La Certe.  That tender-hearted man could not endure the
sight of human distress.  If he could not relieve it, he felt
constrained to shut his eyes to it and to flee from it.  At the first
indication of the approach of winter he had come to old McKay with that
peculiarly mild, humble, deprecatory expression of countenance with
which he was wont to preface an appeal for assistance of some sort.

"What iss it you will be wantin' _now_?" demanded the old man, rather
testily, for he had an aversion to the half-breed's sneaking ways.
"Surely you will not be wantin' more powder an' shot efter the supply I
gave you last week?"

O no! nothing could be further from the mind of La Certe.  He had plenty
of ammunition and provisions.  He had only come to say that he was going
back to--to--Red River.

"Weel, weel," returned the Highlander, "there is no call for hesitation,
man, in tellin' me that.  I will not be breakin' my heart when ye are
gone.  I suppose that now ye hev got the best the season can supply, ye
think the comforts o' the Settlement will be more to your taste."

The remonstrative expression on La Certe's face deepened.  The idea of
his own taste or comfort had not once entered his head: but he had a
wife and child whom he was bound to consider, and he had a hut--a home--
in Red River which he felt constrained to look after.  Besides, he had
social duties of many kinds which claimed attention.

"I've no doubt ye hev," said McKay, with a short sarcastic laugh, "an'
ye will attend to them too--I'll be bound.  But ye did not come here, I
suppose, to take a tender farewell o' me.  What iss it you will be
wantin'?  Oot wi' it, man!"

"There is a canoe--" said La Certe, with some hesitation.

"There iss many a canoe!" returned McKay with a peculiar grin.

"True, but there is one on the shore now, close to the flat rock
which--"

"My own canoe!" interrupted the other, "what will ye be wantin' wi'
that?"

La Certe did not wish to appear greedy, but the season was late, and his
own canoe was not in a very fit condition to carry a family round the
shores of a lake so large as Lake Winnipeg.  Would the white father lend
his canoe to him?  It could not be wanted much longer that Fall, and the
one he would leave behind him was an excellent canoe for ordinary
fishing and hunting purposes.  He would be quite willing to hire the
canoe or to pay the full price for it if any accident should happen to
it.

"No," said McKay, firmly.  "No, La Certe; your hiring means borrowing,
and your payin' means owin' a debt for the remainder o' your natural
life.  I will see you at the bottom o' Lake Winnipeg before I will be
lending you my canoe."

La Certe smiled sadly, and gazed at the cap with which his hands played,
as if appealing to it for sympathy.

With an aspect of the profoundest resignation he made his bow and left
the Presence.

But La Certe was not in the least put out by this failure.  He went to
his tent, and recounted the interview to his squaw, who, when he
entered, was in the act of giving her child, a creature of about four
years of age, one or two draws of her pipe, to let it taste how nice it
was.

Smoking in calm placidity, the amiable pair discussed the subject.  The
conclusion they came to was, as usual, harmonious.

"I think he will agree to lend it next time I go to him," said La Certe,
hopefully.

"He will give in," replied Slowfoot, decidedly.

The four-year-old could not understand the subject, and made no comment;
but it howled for another smoke, and got it.

La Certe was wrong, and his wife was right--as usual.  Old McKay did not
agree to "lend" his canoe the "next time," or the next again, but he did
"give in" at last, more, perhaps, to get rid of the half-breed's
importunity than because of good-will, and sold the canoe to him--on
credit.

When that winter was over, the Hudson's Bay Company again encouraged the
settlers to return, under promise of protection, and the spring found
the persevering people, in spite of all difficulties and previous
failures, busy putting into the ground what little seed they possessed,
and otherwise cultivating the soil.

Some of them there were, however, who, after lending a hand in this
work, determined to provide second strings to their bows by following
the buffalo-hunters to the plains.  These were chiefly the young and
strong men, such as Dan Davidson and his brother Peter, Fergus McKay,
Antoine Dechamp, and Jacques Bourassin, among many others.

La Certe also went, as well as his squaw and the four-year-old.  He
managed the thing characteristically thus.

When the half-breeds were making preparations for their spring hunt, he
paid a visit to Duncan McKay, who was busy at the time helping his
father and brother to rebuild their house.  Indeed the edifice was
almost rebuilt, for the erection of small wooden houses does not usually
take long.

"You've come to beg, borrow, or steal, no doubt," said Cloudbrow, who
was worthy of his nickname, for he was as short of temper as Duncan
senior.

No, La Certe had come to do none of these things, he said, with a
conciliatory smile.

"Well, then, you can't have come to buy or to ask advances," growled
Duncan; "for you see that our store and all we possessed has been burnt
by your precious countrymen."

La Certe knew this, and professed himself profoundly grieved as well as
indignant with his countrymen.  No, he did not come to buy or to borrow,
but to hire.  The McKays had still some horses left, and carts.  Could
they not spare a horse and cart to him on hire?

"No, we can do nothing of the sort," said Duncan shortly, resuming his
axe and work.  "You can go to the Company.  Perhaps they will trust
you--though they are fools if they do."

La Certe was regretful, but not cast down.  He changed the subject,
commented on the building that was going on, the prospects of a good
harvest, and finally took refuge in that stale old subject, the weather.
Then he said in a casual way--as if it had just occurred to him--

"By the way--that knife that my wife got from Marie Blanc--"

Young McKay stopped, and looked quickly up for a moment, with a slight
flush, but instantly resumed work.

"Well," he said, quietly, "what about the knife?"

"Would you like to have it--my wife bade me inquire?"

"Why should _I_ like to have it?" he asked carelessly.

"Oh!  I thought it was yours," said La Certe.

"You are mistaken.  I said it was very like mine.  But it is _not_
mine--and I have no wish for what does not belong to me."

"Of course not.  Well, I must be going," said the half-breed, preparing
to leave.  "I wished much to have your horse and cart, for they are both
good, and I would offer you 4 pounds for the trip, which, you know, is
double the usual charge, for I never grudge a good price for a good
thing."

"Yes, all the more when you hev no intention to pay it," said McKay with
a laugh.  "However, since you seem so anxious, and offer so good a
price, I am willing to oblige you this time, in the hope that you are
really becoming an honest man!"

The half-breed was profuse in his thanks, and in his assurance that
Cloudbrow's hopes would certainly not be disappointed.

Having thus attained his chief object, our arch-beggar went off to
obtain provisions.  Those which had been supplied him the previous
autumn by young McKay had been quite consumed by himself and his
friends--for the man, you see, had a liberal heart and hand.

But his first attempts were unsuccessful.  He wanted ammunition.  To go
to the plains without ammunition was obviously useless.  He wanted
food--sugar, tea, flour, pork.  To go to the plains without these would
be dreary work.  But men knew La Certe's character, and refused him.
One after another he tried his friends.  Then he tried them again.  Then
he tried comparative strangers.  He could not try his enemies, for,
strange to say, he had none.  Then he went over them all again.

At last, by indomitable perseverance, he managed to wear out the
patience of one of his friends, who believed in the restoration of the
incorrigible, and he found himself fully equipped to take the field with
his hard-working comrades.

It may be remarked here that the buffalo runners generally went on the
credit system, trusting to a successful hunt to pay off their debts, and
leave them supplied with food for the winter.  But, then, most of these
men were in earnest, and meant to pay off their debts loyally.  Whereas
La Certe--good, humorous, easy-going man--had not the slightest
intention of paying his debts at all!


CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

TREACHERY IN THE AIR.

At this time the half-breeds of the colony of Red River formed a small
party compared with the numbers to which they multiplied in after years,
and the band of hunters who annually went to the plains to chase the
buffalo was proportionally small.  Nevertheless, they were numerous
enough to constitute a formidable band, capable of holding their own,
when united, against any band of wandering Indians who might feel
disposed to attack them.  They were a brave, hardy race of men, but of
course there were some black sheep among them like La Certe.

About sixty or a hundred miles from the Settlement, the party, under
command of Antoine Dechamp, found the buffalo, and preparations were at
once made to attack them.  It was dusk, however, when the herds were
discovered, so that the hunt had to be postponed to the following day.

A small clump of bushes afforded wood enough for camp-fires.  The carts
were ranged in a circle with the trains outward.  Sentries were posted;
the horses were secured; the kettles put on; pipes lighted; and noise,
laughter, song and story, mingled with the shrill voices of children,
were heard far on into the night.

Among the children, if we may venture so to class them, were Archie and
Billie Sinclair--though we suspect that Archie would have claimed, and
with some reason, to be classed with the men.  They belonged to the
camp-fire, which formed a centre to the party composed of Dan and Peter,
Fergus, Dechamp, and Fred Jenkins the sailor.  The latter, who it was
thought had come out to the country by way of a skylark rather than as a
settler, had followed the hunters, bent, he said, on firing a broadside
into a buffalo.  He had brought with him a blunderbuss, which he averred
had been used by his great-grandfather at the battle of Culloden.  It
was a formidable old weapon, capable of swallowing, at one gulp, several
of the bullets which fitted the trading guns of the country.  Its powers
of scattering ordinary shot in large quantity had proved to be very
effective, and had done such execution among flocks of wild-fowl, that
the Indians and half-breeds, although at first inclined to laugh at it,
were ultimately filled with respect.

"I doubt its capacity for sending ball straight, however," remarked Dan
to Jenkins, who was carefully cleaning out the piece, "especially if
charged with more than one ball."

"No fear of it," returned the sailor, with a confident air.  "Of course
it scattered the balls about six yards apart the only time I tried it
with a lot of 'em, but that was at fifty yards off, an' they tell me
that you a'most ram the muzzle against the brutes' sides when chasin'
buffalo.  So there's no room to scatter, d'ee see, till they get inside
their bodies, and when there it don't matter how much they scatter."

"It's well named a young cannon by La Certe," said Peter Davidson, who,
like the seaman, was out on his first buffalo-hunt.  "I never heard such
a roar as it gave that time you brought down ten out of one flock of
ducks on the way up here."

"Ay, Peter, she barked well that time," remarked the sailor, with a
grin, "but, then there was a reason.  I had double-shotted her by
mistake."

"An' ye did it too without an aim, for you had both eyes tight shut at
the time," remarked Fergus.  "Iss that the way they teach ye to shoot at
sea?"

"In course it is," replied Jenkins, gravely.  "That's the beauty o' the
blunderbuss.  There's no chance o' missin', so what 'ud be the use o'
keepin' yer eyes open, excep' to get 'em filled wi' smoke.  You've on'y
got to point straight, an' blaze away."

"I did not know that you use the blunderbuss in your ships at all," said
Dechamp, with a look of assumed simplicity.

"Ho yes, they do," said Jenkins, squinting down the bell-mouthed barrel,
as if to see that the touch-hole was clear.  "Aboard o' one man-o'-war
that I sailed in after pirates in the China seas, we had a blunderbuss
company.  The first-leftenant, who was thought to be queer in his head,
he got it up.

"The first time the company was ranged along the deck he gave the order
to load with ball cartridges.  There was twenty-six of us, all told.

"`We've got no cartridges for 'em, sir,' whispered the man nearest him.

"`If you don't obey orders,' growled the leftenant 'tween his teeth,
`I'll have ye strung up for mutiny every man Jack of you--_load_!' he
repeated in a kind of a yell.

"We had our or'nary belts and pouches on, so we out wi' the or'nary
cartridges--some three, some four,--an', biting off the ends, poured in
the powder somehow, shoved in the balls anyhow, an' rammed the whole
consarn down.

"`Present--fire!' roared the leftenant.

"Bang! went the six an' twenty blunderbusses, an' when the smoke cleared
away there was fourteen out o' the twenty-six men flat on their backs.
The rest o' us was raither stunned, but hearty.

"`Take these men below,' cried the leftenant, `an' send fourteen strong
men here.  We don't want weaklings for _this_ company.'

"After that we loaded in moderation, an' got on better."

"And the pirates--what did _they_ think o' the new weapon?" asked Peter
Davidson, with an amused expression.

"O! they couldn't stand it at all," answered the sailor, looking up from
his work, with a solemnity that was quite impressive.  "They stood fire
only once.  After that they sheered off like wild-cats.  I say, Mistress
La Certe, how long is that lobscouse--or whatever you call it,--goin' to
be in cookin'?"  Slowfoot gave vent to a sweet, low giggle, as she
lifted the kettle off the hook, and thus gave a practical answer to the
question.  She placed before him the robbiboo, or pemmican, soup, which
the seaman had so grievously misnamed.

During the time that the hunters were appeasing their appetites, it was
observed that Antoine Dechamp, the leader of the expedition, was
unusually silent and thoughtful, and that he betrayed a slight look of
anxiety.  It therefore did not surprise Dan Davidson, when the supper
was nearly ended, that Dechamp should rise and leave the fire after
giving him a look which was a silent but obvious invitation to follow.

Dan obeyed at once, and his leader, conducting him between the various
camp-fires, led him outside the circle of carts.

A clear moon lit up the prairie all round, so that they could see its
undulating sweep in every direction.

"Anything wrong, Antoine?" asked Dan in a low voice, when they were out
of earshot of the camp.

"Nothing wrong, Dan."

"Surely," continued the other, while Dechamp paused as if in perplexity,
"surely there can be no chance of Red-skins troubling us on a clear
night like this.  I can distinguish every bush for miles around."

"There is no fear o' Red-skins.  No, I am not troubled about them.  It
is matters concerning yourself that trouble me."

"How's that?  What do you mean, Antoine?"

"Is your brother-in-law-to-be, Duncan McKay, coming to join us this
spring?" asked Dechamp.

"I believe he is--after he has helped his father a bit longer wi' the
farm.  Why do you ask?"

"Well, to say truth, I can't give you a very good reason for my bein'
anxious.  Only I can't help havin' my ears open, and I've heard some
talk among the lads that makes me fear for the young man.  They say, or
hint, that he knows more about the murder o' poor Perrin than he chooses
to tell.  I've not been quite able to find out what makes them suspect
him, but they do suspect him, an' it would be well to warn him not to
come here, for you know there are many opportunities to commit murder on
a buffalo-hunt!"

The incident of the knife, and of Duncan McKay's significant glance, at
once flashed across Davidson's mind, and he felt a terrible sinking of
the heart when the suspicion, once before roused within him, seemed now
to be confirmed.  He resolved, however, to reveal his thoughts to no
one--specially not to Elspie.

"I think it a shame," he said, "that men should allow such rumours to
circulate, when nothing certain has arisen to rouse suspicion.  That
affair of the knife was clearly explained when young McKay declared that
it was not his, though it looked like it.  If he knew anything about the
murder, would he not have been certain to have told us long ago?  And,
surely, you cannot suppose that Duncan killed Perrin with his own hand?
Speak, Dechamp!  Why do you shake your head?"

"I know nothing," returned the leader.  "What right have I to suppose
anything?  I only know that men's deeds are often mysterious and
unaccountable, and that our men have strong suspicion.  For myself, I
have no opinion.  Duncan McKay is probably innocent, for he and Perrin
were not enemies.  I hope he is so, but I advise you to stop his coming
to the camp just now if you can.  His life may depend on it."

"I cannot stop him," returned Dan, with a perplexed look.  "He is
headstrong, as you know, and if he has made up his mind to come, nothing
will stop him."

"Perhaps if he knew his life would be in danger--that might stop him."

"I doubt it; but I will give him the chance.  I will ride back to Red
River without delay, and warn him."

"Good.  When will you start?"

"To-night.  The moon is clear and will not set till morning.  I shall be
well on my way by that time."

"Will you ride alone?"

"No, there may be bad Indians about.  I will ask Okematan or Fergus
McKay to ride with me.  Why did you not speak to Fergus instead of to
me?"

"Because he has not been spoken to by any one," answered Dechamp; "and I
would not be the first to put suspicion into his head about his own
brother.  Besides, your head is clearer; and your interest in Duncan,
for Elspie's sake, is greater than his, no doubt."

"Well, you may be right, Antoine.  At all events if I take Fergus with
me I shall send him back before reaching the Settlement, and say nothing
whatever about my reason for going there.  `Pressing business,' you
know, will be sufficient."

"I'm not so sure of that," returned Dechamp with a laugh.  "Men are apt
to want to know the nature of `pressing business.'  However, it may be
as well to take Fergus.  At any rate you cannot have Okematan, for he is
not in camp, he left soon after we pitched, and I know has not yet
returned."

"It matters not.  Fergus will do better.  He is more companionable."

Returning to camp, Dan Davidson made the proposal to Fergus McKay.  That
worthy was, as he said, ready for anything, and the two were soon
mounted.  They were also well armed, for the risk of meeting a party of
hostile Indians was not altogether out of the question, though
improbable.  Each horseman carried his blanket and provision wallet, his
gun, a long knife almost equal to an ancient Roman sword, and a cavalry
pistol--revolvers not having been invented at that time: at least they
had not come into general use.  Thus provided for all contingencies,
they set forth.

As we have said, the night was clear and fine, so that the plains were
open to view in all directions, save where a few scattered clumps of
willows and small trees grew like islets in the ocean.

"It iss this that I like better than farming," said Fergus, as the fresh
horses carried them swiftly and lightly over the prairie waves, and down
into the grassy hollows, now swerving to avoid a badger-hole, or
clearing a small shrub with a little bound.  "I do think that man wass
intended to live in the wilderness, an' not to coop himself up in the
cities like rabbits in their holes."

"Why, Fergus, you should have been born a savage," said Dan.

"Ay, it iss savitch I am that I wass not born a savitch," returned
Fergus with a grim smile.  "What in all the world iss the use of
ceevilisation if it will not make people happy?  A man wants nothing
more than a goot supper an' a goot bed, an' a goot shelter over him, an'
it is a not five hunderd pound a year that we will want to buy that--
whatever."

"But surely man wants a little more than that, Fergus.  He wants
breakfast and dinner usually, as well as supper, and a few comforts
besides, such as tea and sugar--at least the women do--besides pipes an'
baccy--to say nothing of books."

"Oo ay, I will not be denyin' that.  But we've no need for wan half the
luxuries o' ceevilisation.  An' ye know ferry weel, Tan, that my sister
Elspie would be content to live wi' you in a ferry small hoose, and the
bare necessaries of life, but here you are forced to put off the
merritch because our hooses wass burnt, and you are obleeged to wait
till you get a sort o' palace built, I suppose, and a grand farm set
a-goin'."

"Indeed, Fergus, you touch me on a sore point there, but with all your
scorn of luxury, I'm sure you'd be the last man to let his sister marry
a fellow who could take her only to a hut or a wigwam."

"You are right, Tan.  Yet I hev spent many a comfortable night in a hut
an' a wigwam since I came to Red River.  I wish the place wass more
peaceable."

"It will never be more peaceable as long as there are two rival
companies fighting for the furs," said Davidson; "but there's worse than
that goin' on, for some of the Indians, it seems, are mad at the
agreement made between them and Lord Selkirk."

"Wow! that iss a peety.  Where heard ye that?"

"I heard it from La Certe, whose wife Slowfoot, you know, is a Cree
Indian.  It seems that the Crees have always claimed Red River as their
lands; but when Lord Selkirk came to make a treaty with the natives he
found some Saulteaux livin' on the soil, an' his lordship, in ignorance,
gave them an interest in the treaty, though they were mere visitors--an'
indeed don't even claim to be owners of the soil--their lands lying far
to the east of Red River."

"Well," continued Dan, guiding his horse carefully down the next hollow,
for the moon had gone behind a cloud just then, "when the Crees found
out what had been done, they were naturally very angry--an' I don't
wonder--an' they threaten now to expel the Saulteaux from Red River
altogether, an' the white men along wi' them, unless the names of the
Saulteaux chiefs are wiped out o' the contract, an' the annual payment
made to the Crees alone."

"That iss bad, Taniel, ferry bad," said Fergus, as they reached the
bottom of the hollow and began to ascend the succeeding undulation, "an'
I am all the more sorry to hear it because our goot frund Okematan is a
Cree."

"Ay, Fergus, he is a great chief of the Crees, and a man of considerable
influence among his people.  I should not like to have him for an
enemy."

"Stop!" said Fergus in a whisper at that moment, laying his hand on
Davidson's arm.

Dan drew rein at once and looked at his friend, but could not clearly
see his face, for the moon was still behind thick drifting clouds.

They had just risen high enough on the prairie wave, which they had been
ascending, to be able to see over it, and Dan could perceive by the
outstretched neck of his companion that he was gazing intently at
something directly in front.

"What do you see, Fergus?" he asked in a low voice.

"Do you see nothin', Taniel?" was the Highlander's reply.

"Why, yes.  I see the plains stretching away to the horizon--an' dark
enough they are, too, at this moment.  I also see a few small clumps
that look like bushes here an' there."

"Don't you see the clump that's nearest to you--right foment your nose?"
said the other.

"Of course I do," and he stopped abruptly, for at that moment he saw a
spark in the clump referred to--a spark so small that it might have been
taken for a glow-worm, had such a creature existed there.

"Savitches!" whispered the Highlander.  "Let's get into the hollow as
fast as we can."

This retrograde movement was soon effected, and the friends dismounted.

"Now, Fergus, what's the best thing to be done?"

"I will be leavin' that to you, Taniel, for you've a clearer head than
mine."

"We dare not ride forward," said Dan, as if communing with himself, "an'
it would be foolish to make a long detour to escape from something until
we know there is something worth escaping from.  My notion is that we
hobble or picket our horses here, and go cautiously forward on foot to
see what it is."

"You'll be doin' what ye think best, Captain Taniel, an' you will find
that private Fergus will back you up--whatever."

This being settled, the two men picketed their steeds in the hollow,
fastened their guns to the saddles, as being too cumbrous for a creeping
advance, and, armed only with their long knives and pistols, reascended
the prairie wave.  With feet clothed in soft moccasin, and practised by
that time in the art of stealthy tread, they moved towards the summit
noiseless as ghosts.

On gaining the ridge they sank slowly down into the tall grass and
disappeared.

After a prolonged and somewhat painful creep on hands and knees the two
men reached the edge of the clump of bushes already referred to.

Before reaching it they discovered, from the sound of voices, that a
party of some kind was encamped there; but, of course, as they knew not
who, it became needful to proceed with extreme caution.  When they
gained the edge of the clump, and raised their heads over a low
bush-covered bank, they beheld a sight which was not calculated to cheer
them, for there, in the centre of the bush, encircling a very small
fire, sat a war-party of about fifty painted and befeathered braves of
the Cree Indians.  They were engaged in council at the moment.

A creeping sensation about their scalps was experienced by the two
eavesdroppers on observing that they had passed not a hundred yards from
a sentinel who occupied a low knoll on their left.

Neither Dan nor Fergus dared to speak--not even to whisper.  Still less
did they dare to move; for a few moments after they reached the bank
just referred to, the moon came out from behind the clouds and flooded
the whole scene as with the light of day.

There was nothing left for it, therefore, except to lie still and
listen.  But this gave them small comfort; for, although quite within
earshot of the war-party, the language spoken was utterly unintelligible
to either of them.

Their eyes, however, were not so useless as their ears, for they could
clearly see each warrior as he rose to harangue his comrades, and, from
the vindictive expression of their faces as well as their frequent
pointing in the direction of the buffalo-hunters it was abundantly
evident that an attack upon them was being discussed.

At last, after many braves had spoken, a chief of tall and noble mien
arose.  His back was towards the two spies, but the moment they heard
his voice they turned their heads and gazed at each other in speechless
amazement, for the voice was quite familiar.

No word did they dare to utter, but Fergus made formations with his lips
of a most extravagant nature, which, however, clearly spelt "Okematan."
When he had finished, he nodded and turned his gaze again on the Crees.

Both men now understood that treachery was in the wind, and that a night
attack was highly probable; and, of course, they felt desperately
anxious to jump up and fly back to the camp to warn their comrades--for
their only fear was a surprise.  The half-breeds being far more numerous
than the Indians, and well entrenched, there could be no fear for them
if prepared.

Just then, as if to favour them, the moon retired behind a huge black
cloud.

Without a moment's hesitation Dan began to creep away back, closely
followed by Fergus.  They gave a wide berth of course to the sentinel,
and soon regained the hollow where the horses had been left.  Here they
breathed more freely.

"Who would have thought this of Okematan?" muttered Dan, as he hastily
tightened his saddle-girths.

"The _rascal_!" exclaimed Fergus, in deep tones of indignation.

"You must gallop back to camp at once, Fergus," said Dan, as they
mounted.  "I will go on to Red River alone."

"What! will you not be coming with me?" asked the Highlander, in some
surprise.

"There is no need, for there will be no fighting," returned the other.
"Our fellows far outnumber the Red-skins, and when the latter find that
we have been warned, and are on our guard, they won't attack us, depend
on it.  But you'll have to ride fast, for when such fellows make up
their minds to strike they don't usually waste time in delivering the
blow.  My business presses, I _must_ go on."

A minute later, and Dan Davidson was galloping towards the Settlement
alone, while Fergus made the best of his way back to the camp of the
buffalo runners.


CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED.

Whether or not Okematan was as thorough a rascal as Fergus McKay thought
him will be best shown by harking back, and setting down a little of
what was said by some of the Cree braves at the time that Fergus and Dan
were eavesdropping.

Standing in a dignified attitude worthy of an ancient Roman, with his
blanket thrown toga-fashion over one shoulder, one of the braves looked
round on the warrior band with a dark scowl before he began.  His
comrades were evidently impressed by his looks.  Whether owing to a
freak of fancy, a spice of eccentricity, or simple vanity, we know not,
but this brave had, among other ornamental touches to his visage,
painted his nose bright red.  The effect on his brother braves was
solemnising.  It was not so impressive to his white observers, as it
suggested to them the civilised toper.

"The great white chief," began Rednose, with a slow deliberation that
was meant to convey a settled and unalterable conviction, "is a fool!"

"Waugh!" exclaimed the audience with emphasis, for the language was
strong, and uttered with intense vigour, and that quite accorded with
their tastes, so they agreed with the sentiment without regard to its
signification.  This species of rhetoric, and its effects, are sometimes
observed in connection with civilised gatherings.

The great white chief thus irreverently referred to, we regret to say,
was Lord Selkirk.

"The great white chief," continued Rednose, availing himself of the
force of emphatic repetition, "is a fool!  He is a child!  He knows
nothing!  He comes across the great salt lake from the rising sun, with
the air and aspect of an owl, thinking to teach us--the great Cree
nation--wisdom!"

"Waugh!" from the audience, one of whom, having a cold in his head,
sneezed inadvertently, and was scowled at by the orator for full two
minutes in absolute silence.  If that Cree warrior--he was on his first
war-path--possessed anything akin to the feelings of the Paleface he
must have suffered martyrdom.

"Every one knows," continued the orator, resuming, "that the Crees are
wise.  They can tell a fox from a buffalo.  They understand the
difference between fire and water.  No Paleface sage needs to come from
the rising sun to tell them to eat when they are hungry--to drink when
they are dry.  But this Paleface chief comes with the eyes of the great
northern owl, and says he comes to do us good.  And how does he begin to
do us good?"

Here there was a very decided "Waugh!" as though to say, "Ay, that's the
question," and then a solemn pause for more--during which the man with
the cold drew the reins very tight.

"How does he begin to do us good?" proceeded the orator.  "By entering
into an agreement with _us_ for the use of _our_ lands--and asking our
enemies the Saulteaux to take part in that agreement!"

The sounds of indignation and ferocity that followed this statement are
not translatable.  After a gaze of unutterable meaning round the circle
Rednose went on--

"This, _this_ is the way in which the owl-eyed chief of the Palefaces
begins to do us good!  If this is the way he begins, in what way will he
continue, and,"--here his voice deepened to a whisper--"_how will he
end_?"

The ideas suggested by his question were so appalling that for some
minutes the orator appeared unable to find words to go on, and his
audience glared at him in dread anticipation, as though they expected
him to explode like a bomb-shell, but were prepared to sit it out and
take the consequences.  And he did explode, after a fashion, for he
suddenly raised his voice to a shout that startled even the sentinel on
the distant knoll, and said--

"I counsel war to the knife!  The great white chief--the owl-eyed
fool!--will not blot from our agreement the names of the Saulteaux
chiefs--chiefs! there are no Saulteaux chiefs.  All their braves are
cowards, on the same dead level of stupidity, and their women are--are
nothing, fit for nothing, can do nothing, and must soon come to nothing!
What then?  The duty of Cree warriors lies before us.  We will drive
the Saulteaux into Lake Winnipeg and the Palefaces off the face of the
earth altogether!  Waugh!"

Having thus given vent to the opinions and feelings that consumed him,
Rednose sat down, his audience breathed freely, the distant sentinel
recovered his composure, and the young novitiate brave with the cold in
his head sneezed with impunity.

It would be tedious to recount all that was said at that council of war.
The next brave that rose to "address the house" very much resembled the
first speaker, both in sentiment and personal appearance, except that he
had chosen sky-blue for his nose instead of red.  The only additional
matter that he contributed worth noting was the advice that they should
begin their bloody work by an immediate attack, in the dead of night, on
the camp of the buffalo runners.

This advice was hailed with a good many "Waughs," as well as approving
nods and looks, and it seemed as if the plan were about to be carried
into action without delay, when, as we have seen, Okematan arose to
address the assemblage.

Okematan was a great chief--much greater in the estimation of his tribe
than the whites with whom he had been associating in Red River were
aware of.  He had purposely reserved his address till near the
conclusion.

"The Cree warriors," he said, with an air of quiet dignity that was far
more effective than the more energetic tones and gestures of the
previous speakers, "know very well that the Cree nation considers itself
the wisest in creation.  Far be it from Okematan to say otherwise, for
he does not know.  Okematan is a child!  His eyes are only beginning to
open!"

He paused at this point, and looked round with solemn dignity; and the
braves, unaccustomed to such self-depreciative modes of address, gazed
at him with equal solemnity, not unmingled with surprise, though the
latter feeling was carefully concealed.

"When the last great palaver of the Cree braves was held on the
Blue-Pine Ridge," continued Okematan, "the chiefs chose me to go to Red
River, and learn all that I could find out about the Palefaces and their
intentions.  I went, as you know.  I attached myself to a family named
Daa-veed-sin, and I have found out--found out much about the Palefaces--
much more that I did not know before, though I _am_ a chief of the Cree
nation."

Okematan looked pointedly at Rednose as he said this.  After a brief
pause he continued--

"The great white chief," (meaning Lord Selkirk), "is _not_ a fool.  It
is true that he is not a god; he is a man and a Paleface, subject to the
follies and weaknesses of the Palefaces, and not quite so wise as it is
possible to be, but he is a good man, and wishes well to the Indian.  I
have found weaknesses among the Palefaces.  One of them is that their
chiefs plan--sometimes wisely, sometimes foolishly--but they leave the
carrying out of their plans to other men, and sometimes these other men
care for nobody but themselves.  They tell lies, they mislead the great
white chief, and tell him to do what is wrong.

"So it was when our agreement came to be made.  The great white chief
found, when he came to Red River, a few families of Saulteaux whom we
had permitted to hunt on our lands.  He thought the land belonged to the
Saulteaux as well as to the Crees.  He was mistaken, ignorant; he knew
no better, and the Palefaces who did know, did not put light into him;
so the names of Saulteaux chiefs were put in the writing.  Then the
great white chief went away across the great salt lake to the lands of
the rising sun, leaving his small chiefs to carry out his plans.  Some
of these are _very_ small chiefs, unfit to carry out any plans.  Others
are bad small chiefs, that will carry out only such plans as are sure to
benefit themselves.  It is these men with whom we have to deal.  It is
these who deserve to be swept off the face of the earth."

A number of emphatic nods and "waughs" at this point showed that
Okematan had at last touched a key-note with which his braves could
shout in harmony.

"But," resumed the chief impressively, "we cannot sweep them off the
earth; we cannot even sweep them off the banks of Red River.  We might
easily sweep the Saulteaux into Lake Winnipeg if we thought it worth
while to try, but the Palefaces--never!  Okematan has travelled far to
the south and seen the Palefaces there.  They cannot be counted.  They
swarm like our locusts; they darken the earth as our buffaloes darken
the plains.  They live in stone wigwams.  I have seen one of their
wigwams that was big enough to hold all the Crees' wigwams bundled
together.  If we killed or scalped all the Palefaces in Red River the
great white chief would come over the great salt lake with an army that
would swallow us up as the buffalo swallows up a tuft of grass.

"Besides," continued Okematan, with a slight touch of pathos in his
tone, "there are good and bad men among the Palefaces, just as there are
good and bad among ourselves.  I have dwelt for many moons with a tribe
called Scosh-min.  Okematan loves the Scosh-min.  They speak a wonderful
language, and some of them are too fond of fire-water; but their braves
fear nothing, and their squaws are pretty and work hard--almost as hard
as our squaws--though they are not quite as good-looking as ours.  They
are too white--their faces are like buffalo fat!"

A "Waugh," which might be translated "Hear, hear," greeted this
statement of opinion.

"Now," continued our chief, "if we swept away all the people of Red
River, we would sweep away the good Scosh-min, which would be foolish,
and we would gain nothing in the end, but would bring worse trouble on
our heads.  My counsel, therefore, is for peace.  I advise that we
should let the buffalo runners and the people of Red River alone; send a
message with our grievances to the great white chief; ask him to come
back over the great salt lake to put things right, and, in the meantime,
wait with patience; attend to our own business; hunt, fish, eat, drink,
sleep, and be happy."

Having delivered his harangue, Okematan sat down amid murmurs of mingled
applause and disapprobation.  It was evident that he had created a
serious division of opinion in the camp, and it seemed as if on the
impression made by the next speaker would depend the great question of
peace or war.

Presently an old warrior arose, and a profound silence followed, for
they held him in great respect.

"My braves," said the old man sententiously, "I have lived long, and my
fighting days are nearly over.  If wisdom has not accumulated on my head
it must be my own fault, for I have had great experience both of war and
peace--more of war, perhaps, than of peace.  And the opinion that I have
come to after long and very deep consideration is this: if there is
something to fight for, fight--fight well; if there is nothing to fight
for, don't fight--don't fight at all."

The old man paused, and there were some "Waughs" of approval, for the
truth contained in his profound conclusion was obvious even to the
stupidest Red-skin of the band--supposing that a stupid brave among
Crees were possible!

"I have also lived to see," continued the old man, "that revenge is
nothing--nothing at all, and therefore not worth fighting for."

As this was flying straight in the face of the most cherished of
Red-skins' beliefs, it was received in dead though respectful silence.

"My young braves do not believe this.  I know it.  I have been young
myself, and I remember well how pleasant revenge was to me, but I soon
found that the pleasure of revenge did not last.  It soon passed away,
yet the deed of revenge did not pass away, and sometimes the deed became
to my memory very bitter--insomuch that the pleasantness was entirely
swallowed up and forgotten in the bitterness.  My young braves will not
believe this, I know.  They go on feeling; they think on feeling; they
reason on feeling; they trust to feeling.  It is foolish, for the brain
was given to enable man to think and judge and plan.  You are as foolish
as if you were to try to smell with your mouth and eat with your nose.
But it is the way of youth.  When experience teaches, then you will come
to know that revenge is not worth fighting for--its pleasantness will
pass away, but the bitter it leaves behind will never pass away.

"What is the meaning of revenge?" continued this analytical old savage.
"What is the use of it?  Does it not mean that we give up all hope of
getting what we want, and wildly determine to get what pleasure is still
possible to us by killing those who have thwarted us?  And when you have
killed and got all the pleasure there is, what does it come to?  Your
enemy is dead, and scalped.  What then?  He does not know that he is
dead.  He does not care that he is dead and scalped.  You cannot keep
him alive for ever killing and scalping him.  But you have made his wife
and children miserable.  What of that?  It was not his wife and children
who opposed you, therefore you have revenged yourself on the wrong
persons.  He does not know that you have rendered his wife and children
miserable, and does not care; therefore, I ask, why are you pleased?  If
your enemy was a good man, your revenge has only done him a kindness,
for it has sent him to the happy hunting grounds before his time, where
you will probably never meet him to have the pleasure of being revenged
on him there.  If he was a bad man, you have sent him to the world of
Desolation, where he will be waiting to receive you when you get there,
and where revenge will be impossible, for men are not allowed to kill or
scalp there.  At least if they are I never heard of it--and I am an old
man now.

"There is nothing, then, to fight for with the Palefaces of Red River,
and my counsel is, like that of Okematan, that we should decide on
peace--not war."

And if not, let's see: you want your gift to batirte by Carlos - Me? Well
first of all that you give everyone his due. Do you belong to his family
the crown? Well that was the argument. - And that's all - with Luna
displicencia asked. - That is the least of. What I wanted and want is
that the nation has a good master, a man straight, good Catholic, who,
without monsergas laws or courts, to rule us all with the bread
in one hand and the stick in the other.

To crook, ¡garrotazo!

, And honored, "Come on five!

, You are my friend! 'A king not to allow the rich to the poor and tramples
mocks him, do not let anyone die of starvation wanted to work ... Come
on, I think I understand. - Why do you think existed in another
era and that will restore your king? You paint those centuries of
greatness and welfare are just the most evil of our history, the
cause of Spanish decline, the principle of all our ills. - Stop
there, Gabrielillo!

- Said _Vara of plata_ -- . You know a lot, you've traveled and read
more than me, but that's not school. I am somewhat aware of the issue and
I will not be allowed to abuse the ignorance of all these and Mariano.
How can you say that those times were bad and they are to blame for what
happens to us now? The real culprit is the Liberal Party, the disbelief
of the time, having got the devil in our house. Spain, where their kings,
and certainly has no faith in Catholicism is that releases like a lame
crutches and has been on the ground.

Without the throne and the altar are not anyone have the test and
what is happening to us since we had revolutions. We removed the islands
do not paint anything from other peoples, the Spaniards, who are
the bravest men of the world, they are defeated, there is a penny,
and all those gentlemen who voted in Madrid, chatting and new
contributions are always trapped.

When it was at one time? When ...? - Were worse, more shameful - said Moon.
- You're crazy, kid. These trips have corrupted you, you have to think
very little Spanish. Look that you deny what everybody knows, what
to teach in schools ... And the Catholic Kings were anything? Not
need books to know. Enter and see the choir stalls down into all
the battles that religious monarchs won from the Moors with the help
of God. Conquered Granada and threw the infidels we had seven centuries
in barbarism.

Then came the discovery of America. Who could do that?

We and anybody else we: that good queen who committed her jewels to make
Columbus the blessed his journey. This I can not deny, I think. And
the Emperor Charles V? What should you tell him? Do you know a special
man?

We beat all the kings of Europe, half of his world was "the sun never
put in their domains; Spaniards were masters of the earth. This can not
be denied.

And do not say anything about Don Felipe II, a monarch so wise, so smart,
making her dance like the kings of Europe as a trickle of them
tirase ....

All for the greater glory of Spain and glory of religion. Victories
and let greatness. If his father won in Pavia, trapping the enemy at
San Quentin. What about Lepanto?

Down in the sacristy, the flags are stored in the ship that rode Don Juan
de Austria. You've seen those, one bearing the image of Jesus crucified,
and are so large, so large, that hang from _triforium_ is needed so that
the ends do not touch the ground. ¿Neither of Lepanto was nothing
...? Come on, Gabriel, who must be crazy to deny certain things! If
you had to kill muslims not to take over Europe, threatening the
Christian faith, who has done? Spaniards.

The Turks threatened to take over the seas, who will step to the
left?

Spain with his Don Juan.

And to discover a new world, the boats from Spain, and to give back
to land, another Spanish, Magellan and all the big, us, always us,
then religion and welfare.

And do not say of wisdom! Those centuries produced the most famous of
Spain, eminentísimos great poets and theologians. Nobody has matched
later. And to demonstrate that religion is the source of all greatness,
the most illustrious writers priest wore habits ...

I guess what can be argued. So that after a glorious monarchs, came others
less large and began to decline. I also know something of this: I heard
the librarian of the cathedral and other persons of great science.

But this means nothing. Son of God, which is testing the people, as well
as individuals, making them lose up to go back again if you see
who persevere in the good way ...

But let us not talk about this. If there was decay, we know nothing of
it. We want the glorious past, the brilliant centuries of the Catholic
monarchs, Don Carlos and both Philip and they talk about when we went
to Spain to return to its heyday. - Well these centuries, don Antolín
- said Gabriel calmly - the decadence of Spanish, they began our ruin.
No wonder his indignation: you repeat what you have taught. There are
people out there for further study, not least if they are irritated play
what they call our golden age.

Is the fault of the education given in this country. History is a lie, to
know so bad, it would be best ignored.

In schools teach the country's past with a similar approach to that of
the wild, that the objects seen by the brightness, not its value and
usefulness. Spain has been great and was on track to be the first
nation in the world merit strong and positive that they had not
been able to dismember the vagaries of war and politics.

But that was before you extols those centuries before the foreign sovereigns
in the Middle Ages, which did presage much hope faded after the
consolidation of national unity. Our Middle Ages produced a cultured
people, industrious and civilized as any of the world. It piles up in
materials to build a great nation, but came from outside architects
and built this building, whose first years of existence amaze you
with the splendor of novelty, but whose ruins we walk now.

Gabriel forgetting all caution in the heat of the discussion. Does not
inspire fear _Vara of the plata_ gesture with his inquisitor incapable
of reasoning, I wanted to convince you, felt the sting, the irresistible
momentum of their time proselytizing, and he spoke without restraining
their thoughts, without seeking to disguise any consideration to
the environment around them.

Don Antolín heard him with amazement, his gaze fixed on the cold. The
others listened confusedly presintiendo ideas such as special securities
issued in the cloisters of a cathedral. Don Martin, the priest
of the nuns behind its protective avariento showed in their eyes
with greed nice welcoming words of the Moon.

Described the Spanish-Roman people, which had passed without causing major
invasion goda dent. Rather, the conqueror had been soaked in low-latin
degeneration, leaving forces in fighting corruption and intrigue
theological dynasty similar to those of Byzantium. Regeneration was
not coming to Spain for the North, with the hordes of barbarians,
was presented by the south, with the Arab invaders. At first very few,
however, was sufficient to defeat Ruder and corrupted heroes. The
instinct of nationality Christian turning against the invaders,
the withdrawal of Spanish whole soul to the cliffs of Covadonga to
fall back on the conqueror, was a lie.

The Spain then welcomed the people who came from Africa, the people
were delivered without resistance, a bunch of Arab horsemen who are
open enough to the gates of a city.

It was a civilizational issue rather than a conquest, and a steady
stream of emigration was established in the strait.

He spent that youthful and vigorous culture, fast and amazing growth,
which had just expired birth: a civilization created by the religious
enthusiasm of the Prophet, who had assimilated the best of Judaism
and the Byzantine culture, also carrying with it the great india
tradition, the remains of Persia and much of the mysterious China.

It was the East that was in Europe, not as the Assyrian monarchs, by Greece,
who repelled them, seeing their freedom in danger, but on the other
extreme, the Spain, the slave kings warring theologians and bishops,
who received the open arms of the invaders.

In two years of what is enseñorearon then took seven centuries seize. It
was not an invasion that contains the weapons was a young civilization
that lacked roots everywhere.

The principle of religious freedom, eternal foundation of the great
nationalities, went with them.

In cities dominated accepted the Christian church and the Jewish
synagogue.

The mosque was not afraid to temples in the country: the respected placed
between them without envy or desire to dominate. VIII to the XV
century was founded and developed the highest civilization and opulent
Europe during the Middle Ages. While the peoples of the North diezmábanse
in religious wars and lived in a barbaric tribe, the population of
Spain was in excess of thirty million, turning and kneading it in
all races and all beliefs, with an infinite variety of powerful
vibrations generated social, similar to the modern American people.
Confused Christians and Muslims lived, pure Arab, Syrian, Egyptian,
Mauritanian, Jews of Spanish and Jewish traditions of the East,
leading to the crossing of domestic and Mozarabic, mudejar, and muladi
hebraizantes. And in this rich mix of peoples and races came
all the ideas, customs and discoveries so far known on earth, all
the arts, sciences, industries, inventions and culture of ancient
civilizations, clash of the budding new discoveries and creative
energies.

Silk, cotton, coffee, paper, orange, lemon, pomegranate, sugar, came with
them from the East, as well as carpets, tissue, the tules, the
adamasquinados and gunpowder.

They also decimal numbers, algebra, alchemy, chemistry, medicine, cosmology
and rhyming poetry. The Greek philosophers, next to disappear into oblivion,
is saved following the Arabic invaders in their conquests. Aristotle
reigned in the famous University of Cordova. The spirit of chivalry
was born among the Arabs in Spain, seized after the warriors of
the North, like an attribute of people Christians.

While in Europe of barbarian Franks, the Anglo-Norman and German people
living in shacks and the kings and lords of castles nested in rocks
blackened by the fires, eaten by vermin, clothed and fed as estameña
of prehistoric men, Arabs Spaniards raised their great fortresses,
and refined as ancient Rome, reuníanse in the bathroom to talk on
scientific or literary.

If a monk of the North felt the itch of knowledge, universities
came to the Arabs or Jewish synagogues in Spain, and the kings of
Europe were believed to be saved if their illnesses, in force for
gold, could provide a Spanish doctor.

And when little just the element is separated from the native invader
and emerging small Christian nationalities, Arabs and Spaniards
old - if that is after the unrelenting blood can cross a marked
boundary between the two races - fight knightly without exterminated
after victory, an estimated one another, with large intervals of
peace, as if they wanted to delay the moment of final separation
and joining many times for joint ventures.

A regime of liberty prevailed in the Christian.

Justices emerge much earlier than in northern countries of Europe and
the Spanish people are governed and govern themselves by their costs,
looking only at a military monarch. The municipalities are small
republics, with their elected judges. Citizen militias carried out the
ideal of democratic army. The Church, committed to the people, living
in peace with other religions of the country, creates an intelligent
middle class in the industry and powerful weapon in the coastal sea of
the first period, and Spanish products are the most prized in all
ports in Europe.

Cities existed as popular as the modern capital of the world, whole
populations were huge factories tissue is grown all over the floor
of the Peninsula.

The Catholic Kings marked the apogee of national forces and the beginning
of its decline.

His reign was great because it lasted until the pulse energy incubated
by the Middle Ages, because its policy was execrable the twisted
paths of Spain, driving the religious fanaticism and ambitions of
a universal end.

Developed in two or three centuries to the rest of Europe, Spain
was the world then it is time for our England. To follow the same policy
of religious tolerance, the confusion of races, industrial and
agricultural work, rather than military enterprises, where would
we be now?

Gabriel made this question interrupting his warm description of the
past. - The rebirth - continued Luna - Spanish that was more Italian.
In Italy revived the beautiful lyrics of the old Greco-Roman art, but
not all the Renaissance was literature. The Renaissance represents
the emergence of a new life, crops, industries, military, science,
etc.. And who did this but Spain, that Spain Arabic-Hebrew-Christian de
los Reyes Católicos?

El Gran Capitán taught the world the art of modern warfare; Pedro Navarro
was an amazing engineer, the first Spanish troops to use firearms,
thus creating the infantry, which democratized the war, giving
superiority to the people on the noble riders covered iron.

Spain was the one who discovered America. - And you think all that little
- interrupted Antolín gift -. Do you not agree that the same thing
I said?

Have you ever seen so many great things together in Spain and in the days
of those kings who were called by a Catholic? - I admit that was a
great period in our history, the last truly glorious, the last beam
before it launched the single die that Spain has gone in the right
direction.

But before his death the Catholic Monarchs and the decline begins
to quarter the body of the young and robust Spain Arabic, Christian
and Jewish.

"Does the Cree chief," he asked, with something of doubt in his tone and
look, "choose the hours of night to consult with warriors about secret
assaults and surprises on friends?"

"He does not!" answered the Indian, decidedly but calmly--though he was
unquestionably astonished at being questioned so pointedly and correctly
as to his recent proceedings, and felt that he must have been followed.
He was not the man, however, to betray his feelings, or to commit
himself in any way; therefore he took refuge in silence.

"Come now, Okematan," said his companion in a confidential tone.  "Don't
let a misunderstanding arise between you and me.  What is this that I
have heard?  You spent last night, as you admit, with a party of Crees
on the war-path.  You were seen and heard, and the men of the camp think
you have turned traitor, and they are even now expecting an attack from
this war-party.  Is it true that we are to be attacked?"

"You say I was _heard_," answered the Indian, looking the half-breed
straight in the face.  "If so, those who heard must know what I said."

"Nay, they did indeed hear, but they did not understand, for they know
not your language; but they know the language of signs, and, by the
looks and gestures of the warriors, they guessed what was said and
planned."

"Is it likely," asked the Indian in a low voice, "that Okematan would
return to your camp alone, and put himself in your power, if an attack
was intended?"

"True, true," returned Dechamp with a hearty air; "and, to say truth, I
myself did not--do not--believe you false.  If you tell me the truth,
Okematan, and give me your word that this report is a mistaken one, I
will believe you and trust you."

The Indian seemed pleased with the assurance thus heartily given, but
still maintained his dignified gravity, as he said--

"Okematan _always_ tells the truth.  He had hoped that the folly of some
young braves of his tribe should never have been known to any one; but
since it has been found out, he will tell all he knows to his pale-faced
brother."

Hereupon he related all that had transpired at the council of war, and
the final success of his own speech, with that of the old warrior, in
producing a peaceful solution.

"But are you sure they will follow your advice?" asked Dechamp.

"Yes, Okematan is quite sure."

"Well, then, as I said, I will trust you," returned Dechamp, extending
his hand, which the Indian gravely grasped; "and I will give you
undeniable proof, by giving my young men orders to start after the
buffalo at once--without further delay."


CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

THE BUFFALO-HUNT.

In accordance with the assurance given to Okematan Antoine Dechamp at
once gave orders to make preparation for an immediate start after the
buffalo--much to the satisfaction of the hunters, especially the young
ones.

Buffaloes--or, to speak more correctly, bisons--roamed over the North
American prairies at the time we write of in countless thousands; for
the Indians, although extremely wasteful of animal life, could not keep
their numbers down, and the aggressive white-man, with his deadly gun
and rifle, had only just begun to depopulate the plains.  Therefore the
hunters had not to travel far before coming up with their quarry.

In a very brief space of time they were all drawn up in line under
command of their chosen leader, who, at least up to the moment of giving
the signal for attack, kept his men in reasonably good order.  They had
not ridden long when the huge ungainly bisons were seen like black
specks on the horizon.

Still the horsemen--each armed with the muzzle-loading,
single-barrelled, flint-lock gun of the period--advanced cautiously,
until so near that the animals began to look up as if in surprise at the
unwonted intrusion on their great solitudes.

Then the signal was given, the horses stretched out at the gallop, the
buffalo began to run--at first heavily, as if great speed were
impossible to them; but gradually the pace increased until it attained
to racing speed.  Then the hunters gave the rein to their eager steeds,
and the long line rushed upon the game like a tornado of centaurs.

From this point all discipline was at an end.  Each man fought for his
own hand, killing as many animals as he could, so that ere long the
plain was strewn with carcases, and the air filled with gunpowder smoke.

We have said that all the hunters set out, but this is not strictly
correct, for three were left behind.  One of these had fallen sick; one
had sprained his wrist, and another was lazy.  It need scarcely be told
that the lazy one was Francois La Certe.

"There is no hurry," he said, when the hunters were assembling for the
start; "plenty of time.  My horse has not yet recovered from the
fatigues of the journey.  And who knows but the report of the buffalo
being so near may be false?  I will wait and see the result.  To-morrow
will be time enough to begin.  Then, Slowfoot, you will see what I can
do.  Your hands shall be busy.  We will load our cart with meat and
pemmican, pay off all our debts, and spend a happy winter in Red River.
What have you got there in the kettle?"

"Pork," answered Slowfoot with characteristic brevity.

"Will it soon be ready?"

"Soon."

"Have you got the tea unpacked?"

"Yes."

"Send me your pipe."

This latter speech was more in the tone of a request than a command, and
the implied messenger from the opposite side of the fire was the baby--
Baby La Certe.  We never knew its name, if it had one, and we have
reason to believe that it was a female baby.  At the time, baby was
quite able to walk--at least to waddle or toddle.

A brief order from the maternal lips sent Baby La Certe toddling round
the fire towards its father, pipe in hand; but, short though the road
was, it had time to pause and consider.  Evidently the idea of justice
was strongly developed in that child.  Fair wage for fair work had
clearly got hold of it, for it put the pipe which was still alight, in
its mouth and began to draw!

At this the father smiled benignly, but Slowfoot made a demonstration
which induced a rather prompt completion of the walk without a
reasonable wage.  It sucked vigorously all the time, however, being
evidently well aware that Francois was not to be feared.

At that moment the curtain of the tent lifted, and little Bill Sinclair
limped in.  He was a favourite with La Certe, who made room for him, and
at once offered him the pipe, but Billie declined.

"No, thank you, La Certe.  I have not learned to smoke yet."

"Ha! you did not begin young enough," said the half-breed, glancing
proudly at his own offspring.

We may explain here once for all that, although he had lived long enough
in the colony to understand French, Billie spoke to his friend in
English, and that, although La Certe understood English, he preferred to
speak in French.

"What have you been doing?" he asked, when the boy had seated himself.

"I've been shooting at a mark with my bow and arrow--brother Archie made
it for me."

"Let me see--yes, it is very well made.  Where is brother Archie?"

"Gone after the buffalo."

"What!--on a horse?"

"He could not go very well after them on foot--could he?" replied the
boy quietly.  "Dan Davidson lent him a horse, but not a gun.  He said
that Archie was too young to use a gun on horseback, and that he might
shoot some of the people instead of the buffalo, or burst his gun, or
fall off.  But _I_ don't think so.  Archie can do anything.  I know, for
I've seen him do it."

"And so he has left you in camp all by yourself.  What a shame, Billie!"

"No, Francois, it is not a shame.  Would you have me keep him from the
fun just because I can't go?  _That_ would indeed be a shame, wouldn't
it?"

"Well, perhaps you're right, Billie."

"I know I'm right," returned the boy, with a decision of tone that would
have been offensive if it had not been accompanied with a look of
straightforward gentleness that disarmed resentment.  "But, I say,
Francois, why are you not out with the rest?"

"Oh, because--because--Well, you know, my horse is tired, and--and, I'm
not quite sure that the buffalo really have been seen as near as they
say.  And I can go to-morrow just as well.  You see, Billie, there is no
need to hurry oneself."

"No, I don't see that.  I think there's always need for hurry, specially
with men like you.  I know the reason you don't go out better than
yourself, Francois."

"Yes--what is it?" asked the half-breed with a slight laugh.

"It's laziness.  That's what it is, and you should be ashamed of
yourself."

The large mild eyes and low voice, and pale earnest face of the
plain-spoken invalid were such that it would have been impossible for
any one to be offended with him, much less La Certe, whose spirit of
indignation it was almost impossible to arouse.  He winced a little at
the home-thrust, however, because he knew it to be true.

"You're hard on me, Little Bill," he said with a benignant look, as he
picked a stick from the fire and inserted its glowing end in his pipe.

"No, I'm not hard," returned the boy gravely.  Indeed he was always
grave, and seldom laughed though he sometimes smiled faintly at the
jokes and quips of his volatile brother and Fred Jenkins the seaman:
"I'm not half hard enough," he continued; "I like you, Francois, and
that's the reason why I scold you and try to get you to mend.  I don't
think there's such a lazy man in the whole Settlement as you.  You would
rather sit and smoke and stuff yourself with pork all day than take the
trouble to saddle your horse and get your gun and go out with the rest.
Why are you so lazy, Francois?"

"I'm sure I don't know, Little Bill, unless it be that I'm born to be
lazy.  Other people are born, I suppose, to be active and energetic.
They like activity and energy, and so they do it.  I like repose and
quiet, and--so I do that.  Not much difference after all!  We both do
what we like best!"

Little Bill was perplexed.  Although philosophical in tendency he had
not had sufficient experience in sophistical reasoning to enable him to
disentangle the sinuosities of bad logic.  But he was a resolute little
fellow, and not easily quelled.

"What would happen," he asked, "if everybody in the world did as you
do?"

"Well, I suppose everybody would enjoy themselves.  There would be no
more fightings or wars, or any trouble of that sort, if everybody would
only take things easy and smoke the pipe of peace."

"Hm!  I don't know about that," returned the boy, doubtfully; "but I'm
quite sure there would not be much pemmican in Red River this winter if
all the hunters were like you.  I wonder you're not ashamed, Francois.
Sometimes I think that you're not worth caring about; but I can't help
it, you know--we can't force our likings one way or other."

La Certe was a good deal taken aback.  He was not indeed unaccustomed to
plain speaking, and to the receipt of gratuitous abuse; but his
experience invariably was to associate both with more or less of a stern
voice and a frowning brow.  To receive both in a soft voice from a
delicate meek-faced child, who at the same time professed to like him,
was a complete novelty which puzzled him not a little.

After a few minutes' profound consideration, he put out his pipe and
arose quickly with something like an appearance of firmness in his look
and bearing.

Slowfoot, whose utter ignorance of both French and English prevented her
understanding the drift of the recent conversation, was almost startled
by the unfamiliar action of her lord.

"Where go you?" she asked.

"To follow the buffalo," answered La Certe, with all the dignity of a
man bursting with good resolutions.

"Are you ill?" asked his wife, anxiously.

To this he vouchsafed no reply, as he raised the curtain and went out.

Little Bill also went out, and, sitting down on a package, watched him
with his large solemn eyes, but said never a word until the half-breed
had loaded his gun and mounted his horse.  Then he said: "Good luck to
you, Francois!"

La Certe did not speak, but with a grave nod of his head rode slowly out
of the camp.  Little Bill regarded him for a moment.  He had his bow and
a blunt-headed arrow in his hand at the time.  Fitting the latter
hastily to the bow he took a rapid shot at the retreating horseman.  The
arrow sped well.  It descended on the flank of the horse with
considerable force, and, bounding off, fell to the ground.  The result
was that the horse, to La Certe's unutterable surprise, made a sudden
demivolt into the air--without the usual persuasion--almost unseated its
rider, and fled over the prairie like a thing possessed!

A faint smile ruffled the solemnity of Little Bill at this, but it
vanished when he heard a low chuckle behind him.  Wheeling round, he
stood face to face with Slowfoot, whose mouth was expanded from ear to
ear.

"Clever boy!" she said, patting him on the back, "come into the tent and
have some grub."

She said this in the Cree language, which the boy did not understand,
but he understood well enough the signs with which the invitation was
accompanied.  Thanking her with an eloquent look, he re-entered the tent
along with her.


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

ADVENTURES OF ARCHIE AND THE SEAMAN.

Meanwhile the buffalo-hunt progressed favourably, and the slaughter of
animals was considerable.

But there were two members of that hunt whose proceedings were not in
exact accord with the habits and laws of the chase, as usually conducted
on the Red River plains.  These were the seaman Jenkins and Archie
Sinclair.

A mutual attachment having sprung up between these two, they had
arranged to keep together during the chase; and when the signal for
attack was given by Dechamp, as before related, they had "set sail,"
according to Jenkins, fairly well with the rest.  But they had not gone
more than a few hundred yards when the boy observed that his nautical
friend was hauling at both reins furiously, as if desirous of stopping
his horse.  Having a gun in one hand he found the operation difficult.

Archie therefore reined in a little.

"Bad luck to it!" growled Jenkins, as his young friend drew near, "the
jaws o' this craft seem to be made o' cast-iron, but I'll bring him to
if I should haul my arms out o' the sockets.  Heave-to, my lad!  Maybe
he'll be willin' to follow a good example."

Archie pulled up, and, as the seaman had hoped, the hard-mouthed steed
stopped, while the maddened buffalo and the almost as much maddened
hunters went thundering on, and were soon far ahead of them.

"What's wrong, Jenkins?" asked Archie, on seeing the sailor dismount.

"Not much, lad; only I want to take a haul at the main brace.  Here,
hold my gun a bit, like a good chap; the saddle, you see, ain't all
right, an' if it was to slew round, you know, I'd be overboard in a
jiffy.  There, that's all right.  Now, we'll up anchor, an' off again.
I know now that the right way to git on board is by the port side.  When
I started from Red River I was goin' to climb up on the starboard side,
but Dan Davidson kep' me right--though he had a good laugh at me.  All
right now.  Hand me the gun."

"Do you mean to say, Jenkins, that you never got on a horse till you
came to Red River?" asked Archie, with a laugh, as they galloped off in
pursuit of the hunters, who were almost out of sight by that time.

"Well, you've no occasion to laugh, lad," returned the seaman.  "I've
bin at sea ever since I was a small shaver, scarce half as long as a
handspike, so I ain't had many opportunities, d'ee see, for we don't
have cavalry at sea, as a rule--always exceptin' the horse marines.

"Then I'm afraid you'll find runnin' the buffalo somewhat difficult,"
returned the boy.  "Not that I know anything about it myself, for this
is the first time I've been out; an' even now Dan won't let me use a
gun; but I've often heard the men talkin' about it! an' some o' them
have complained that they have found it uncommon difficult to load when
at full gallop--specially when the horse is hard in the mouth."

"I make no manner o' doubt you're right, lad, but I've got my sea-legs
on now, so to speak; leastwise I've got used to ridin' in the trip out
here, as well as used to steerin' wi' the tiller-ropes in front, which
seems to me right in the teeth o' natur', though I couldn't see how it
could well be otherwise.  But I confess that my chief difficulty is the
ordnance, for it interferes a good deal wi' the steerin'.
Hows'ever--`never ventur' never win,' you know.  I never expected to
take up a noo purfession without some trouble."

As he spoke, the seaman's horse--a large brown chestnut--put its foot in
a hole, and plunged forward with great violence, barely escaping a fall.

"Hold on!" shouted Archie in alarm.

"Hold on it is!" sang out the sailor in reply.

And hold on it was, for he had the chestnut round the neck with both
arms.  Indeed he was sitting, or lying, on its neck altogether.

"It ain't an easy job," he gasped, while he struggled to regain the
saddle, "when a fellow gets hove on to the bowsprit this way, to git
fairly back on the main-deck again.  But a Jenkins never was beaten in
fair fight.  That's all right.  Now then, Archie, you're an obleegin'
cove.  Do git down an' pick up the gun for me.  You see, if I git down
it's a tryin' job to git up again--the side o' this here craft bein' so
steep an' so high out o' the water.  Thank'ee; why, boy, you jump down
an' up like a powder-monkey.  It ain't broke, is it?"

"No.  It seems all right," answered the boy, as he handed the gun to its
owner.  "But if you let it go like that often, it won't be much worth
when the run's over."

"Let it go, boy?" repeated the sailor.  "It was either let it or myself
go, an' when it comes to a toss up o' that sort, Fred Jenkins knows how
to look arter number one."

It will be seen from all this that our seaman was not quite so much at
home on the prairie as on the sea.  Indeed, if the expression be
permissible, he was very much at sea on that undulating plain, and did
not take so kindly to the green waves of the rolling prairie as to the
heaving billows of the restless ocean; but, as Archie remarked, he was
fast getting broke in.

The incidents which we have mentioned, however, were but the
commencement of a series of disasters to poor Jenkins, which went far to
cure him of a desire to excel in the "noo purfession," and to induce a
somewhat violent longing for a return to his first love, the ocean.

"I can't think what ever could have made you want to come out here,"
said Archie, as they continued to follow up the still distant hunters.

"What was it made yourself want to come out, lad?" asked the sailor.

"It wasn't me that wanted to come.  It was father, you know, an' of
course I had to follow," said the boy in a tone which induced his friend
to say hastily, and in a tone of sympathy--

"Ah, poor lad, I forgot you was a orphing.  Well, you see, I think it
must ha' bin a love o' change or a love o' discontent, or suthin' o'
that sort, as brought me cruising in these here waters, for I can't say
what else it was.  You see I was born a sort o' ro-oh--"

"Look out! a badger-hole!" shouted the boy.

His warning would have been too late, but the chestnut fortunately
leaped over the danger instead of stumbling into it, and its rider was
only partially shaken out of his seat.

"It's well," he said, when fairly settled down again to an easy gallop,
"that the tiller-ropes are stout else I'd ha' bin over the starn this
time instead of out on the bowsprit.  Let me see, what was I sayin' of?"

"Somethin' about your bein' born a sort of `ro-oh--,' though what _that_
may be I haven't a notion."

"Ah! jist so--I was born a sort o' rover (when this long-legged brute
took the badger-hole), an' I've bin to every quarter o' the globe
a'most, but if I'd lived to the age o' Methooslum I'd never ha' thought
o' comin' here,--for the good reason that I knowed nothin' o' its
existence,--if I hadn't by chance in a furrin port fallen in wi' Andre
Morel, an' took an uncommon fancy to him.  You see, at the time, I was--
well, I was no better nor I should be; p'raps a deal wuss, an' Morel he
meets me, an' says--`Hallo, my lad,' says he, `where away?'

"I looked at him gruff-like a moment or two, for it seemed to me he was
raither too familiar for a stranger, but he's got such a pleasant,
hearty look with him--as you know--that I couldn't feel riled with 'im,
so `I'm goin' on the spree,' says I.

"`All right,' says he, `I'm with 'ee, lad.  D'ye know the town?'

"`No more than a Mother Carey's chicken,' says I.  `Come along, then,'
says he; `I'll tak' 'ee to a fust-rate shop.'

"So off we went arm in arm as thick as two peas, an' after passin'
through two or three streets he turns into a shop that smelt strong o'
coffee.

"`Hallo! mate,' says I, `you've made some sort o' mistake.  This here
ain't the right sort o' shop.'

"`O yes, it is,' says he, smilin', quite affable-like.  `The best o'
tipple here, an' cheap too.  Come along.  I've got somethin' very
partikler to say to you.  Look here, waiter--two cups o' coffee, hot an'
strong, some buttered toast, an' no end o' buns, etceterer.'

"Wi' that he led me to a seat, an' we sat down.  I was so took aback an'
amused that I waited to see what would foller an' what he'd got to say
that was so partikler--but, I say, Archie, them buffalo runners has got
the wind o' us, an' are showin' us their heels, I fear."

"Never fear," returned the boy, rising in his stirrups and shading his
eyes to look ahead.  "They do seem to be leavin' us a bit, but you see
by the dust that the buffalo are holdin' away to the right, so if we
keep still more to the right an' cut round that knoll, I think we'll be
safe to catch them up.  They're doin' good work, as the carcasses we've
passed and the rattle o' shots clearly show.  But get on wi' your story,
Jenkins."

"Well, it ain't much of a story, lad.  What Morel had to say was that
he'd arranged wi' an agent o' Lord Selkirk to come out to this country;
an' he was goin' out wi' a lot o' his relations, an' was beatin' up for
a few good hands, an' he liked the look o' me, an' would I agree to go
wi' him?

"Well, as you may believe, this was a poser, an' I said I'd think over
it, an' let him know next day.  You see, I didn't want to seem to jump
at it too eager-like, though I liked the notion, an' I had neither wife,
nor sweetheart, nor father or mother, to think about, for I'm a orphing,
you see, like yourself, Archie--only a somewhat bigger one.

"Well, when we'd finished all the coffee, an' all the buns, an' all the
etceterers, he began to advise me not to ha' nothin' more to do wi'
grog-shops.  I couldn't tell 'ee the half o' what he said--no, nor the
quarter--but he made such a impression on me that I was more than
half-convinced.  To say truth, I was so choke-full o' coffee an' buns,
an' etceterers, that I don't believe I could ha' swallowed another drop
o' liquor.

"`Where are ye goin' now?' says he, when we'd done.

"`Back to my ship,' says I.

"`Come an' ha' tea to-morrow wi' me an' my sister,' says he, `an' we'll
have another talk about Rupert's Land.'

"`I will,' says I.

"`Six o'clock, sharp,' says he.

"`Sharp's the word,' says I.

"An', sure enough, I went to his house sharp to time next day, an' there
I found him an' his sister.  She was as pretty a craft as I ever set
eyes on, wi' a modest look an' long fair ringlets--just borderin' on
nineteen or thereaway--but you know her, Archie, so I needn't say no
more."

"What! is that the same woman that's keeping house for him now in Red
River?"

"Woman!" repeated the sailor, vehemently; "she's not a woman--she's a
angel is Elise Morel.  Don't speak disrespectful of her, lad."

"I won't," returned Archie with a laugh; "but what was the upshot of it
all?"

"The upshot of it," answered the seaman, "was that I've never touched a
drop o' strong drink from that day to this, an' that I'm now blown
entirely out o' my old courses, an' am cruisin' arter the buffalo on the
plains o' Rupert's Land."

At this point, their minds being set free from the consideration of past
history, they made the discovery that the buffalo runners were nowhere
to be seen on the horizon, and that they themselves were lost on the
grassy sea.

"What _shall_ we do?" said the boy, when they had pulled up to consider
their situation.  "You see, although I came out here a good while before
you did," he added, half apologetically, "I've never been out on the
plains without a guide, and don't know a bit how to find the way back to
camp.  The prairie is almost as bad as the sea you're so fond of, with a
clear horizon all round, and nothing worth speaking of to guide us.  An'
as you have never been in the plains before, of course you know nothing.
In short, Jenkins, I greatly fear that we are lost!  Why, what are you
grinning at?"

The terminal question was induced by the fact that the tall seaman was
looking down at his anxious companion with a broad smile on his handsome
sunburnt countenance.

"So we're lost, are we, Archie?" he said, "like two sweet babes on the
prairie instead of in the woods.  An' you think I knows nothin'.  Well,
p'r'aps I don't know much, but you should remember, lad, that an old
salt wi' a compass in his wes'kit-pocket is not the man to lose his
reck'nin'.  I've got one here as'll put us all right on that score, for
I was careful to take my bearin's when we set sail, an' I've been
keepin' an eye on our course all the way.  Make your mind easy, my boy."

So saying, the sailor pulled out the compass referred to, and consulted
it.  Then he pulled out a watch of the warming-pan type, which he styled
a chronometer, and consulted that also; after which he looked up at the
clouds--seamanlike--and round the horizon, especially to windward, if we
may speak of such a quarter in reference to a day that was almost quite
calm.

"Now, Archie, boy, the upshot o' my cogitations is that with a light
breeze on our starboard quarter, a clear sky overhead, an' a clear
conscience within, you and I had better hold on our course for a little
longer, and see whether we can't overhaul the runners.  If we succeed,
good and well.  If not, why, 'bout-ship, and homeward-bound is the
sailin' orders.  What say 'ee, lad?"

"I say whatever you say, Jenkins.  If you're sure o' the way back, as
I've no doubt you are, why, there couldn't be greater fun than to go
after the buffalo on our own account.  And--I say, look there!  Isn't
that somethin' like them on the top o' the far bluff yonder?  A fellow
like you, wi' sharp sailor-eyes, ought to be able to make them out."

"You forget, lad, that I ain't a buffalo runner, an' don't know the cut
o' the brutes' jibs yet.  It does look like somethin'.  Come, we'll go
an' see."  Putting their horses to the gallop, the two curiously matched
friends, taking advantage of every knoll and hollow, succeeded in
getting sufficiently near to perceive that a small herd was grazing
quietly in a grassy bottom between two prairie waves.  They halted at
once for consultation.

"Now, then, Archie," said the sailor, examining the priming of his gun,
"here we are at last, a-goin' to begin a pitched battle.  There's this
to be said for us, that neither you nor me knows rightly how to go to
work, both on us havin' up to this time bin trained, so to speak, on
hearsay.  But what o' that?  In the language o' the immortial Nelson,
`England expec's every man to do his dooty.'  Now it seems to me my
dooty on the present occasion is to lay myself alongside of a buffalo
an' blaze away!  Isn't that the order o' battle?"

"Yes.  But don't go for a bull, and don't go too close for fear he turns
sharp round an' catches you on his horns.  You know the bulls are apt to
do that sometimes."

"Trust me, lad, I'll keep clear o' the bulls."

"And you understand how to re-load?" asked the boy.

"O yes, all right.  Dan put me thro' the gunnery practice on the way
out, an' I went through it creditably.  Only a slight hitch now and
then.  Two or three balls in the mouth ready to spit into the gun--"

"Not all at once, though, Jenkins."

"In course not, lad: one at a time: no ramming; hit the butt on the
saddle; blaze away; one down, another come on--eh?"

"That's it," said Archie, eager for the fray.  "How I wish Dan had let
me have a gun!"

"Safer not, lad.  An' keep well in rear, for I may be apt to fire wide
in the heat of action."

With this final caution, the mariner put his gun on full cock, shook the
reins, and trotted quietly forward until he saw that the buffalo had
observed him.  Then, as he afterwards expressed it, he "clapped on all
sail-stuns'ls alow and aloft, and sky-scrapers--and went into action
like a true blue British tar, with little Archie Sinclair full sail
astern."

He did not, however, come out of action with as much _eclat_ as he went
into it, but justice obliges us to admit that he came out victorious.

We cannot do better than give his own description of that action as
related beside the camp-fire that night, to a circle of admiring
friends.

"Well, you must know," he began, after finishing his supper and lighting
his pipe, "that long-legged frigate o' mine that Dan calls a chestnut--
though a cocoanut would be more like the thing, if you take size into
account--he's as keen for the chase as a small boy arter a butterfly,
an' before I could say `Jack Robinson,' a'most, he had me into the
middle o' the herd an' alongside o' the big bull.  Any one could tell it
was him, in spite o' the dust we kicked up, by reason o' the side-glance
o' his wicked little eye, his big hairy fore'id, an' his tail stickin'
out stiff like a crook'd spankerboom.

"In course I was not a-goin' to fire into him, so I gave the frigate a
dig wi' my heels--tho' I'd got no irons on 'em--an' tried to shove up
alongside of a fat young cow as was skylarkin' on ahead.  As we went
past the bull he made a vicious dab wi' his horn, and caught the frigate
on her flank--right abaft the mizzen chains, like.  Whew! you should ha'
seen what a sheer she made right away to starboard!  If it hadn't bin
that I was on the look-out, I'd ha' bin slap overboard that time, but I
see'd the squall comin', an', seizin' my brute's mane, held on like a
monkey wi' hand an' leg.

"Well, before I knew where I was, the cocoan--I mean the chestnut, had
me alongside the cow.  I stuck the muzzle a'most into her ribs, and let
drive.  Down she went by the head, fairly scuttled, an' I could hear
young Archie givin' a wild cheer astern."

"`That's the way to go it, Jenkins!' he yelled.  `Load again.'

"But it was easier said than done, I can tell you.  You see, I've bin
brought up to cartridges all my life, an' the change to pullin' a
stopper out o' a horn wi' your teeth, pourin' the powder into your left
hand, wi' the gun under your left arm, an' the pitchin' o' the frigate,
like as if it was in a cross sea, was raither perplexin'.  Hows'ever, it
had to be done, for I was alongside of another cow in a jiffy.  I nigh
knocked out two o' my front teeth in tryin' to shove the stopper in my
mouth.  Then, when I was pourin' the powder into my hand, I as near as
could be let fall the gun, which caused me to give a sort of gasp of
anxiety, when two o' the three bullets dropped out o' my mouth, but I
held on to the third wi' my teeth.  Just then a puff o' wind blew the
powder out o' my hand into the buffalo's eyes, causin' her to bellow
like a fog-horn, an' obleegin' me to pour out another charge.  I did it
hastily, as you may well believe, an' about three times what I wanted
came out.  Hows'ever, I lost a deal of it in pourin' it into the gun;
then I spat the ball in, gettin' another nasty rap on the teeth as I did
so, but I'd bit the ball so that it stuck half-way down.

"It was no time to think o' trifles.  I gave the butt an extra bang on
the pommel to send the ball home, shoved the muzzle right in among the
hair an' pulled the trigger.  There was a bang that sounded to me as if
the ship's magazine had blown up.  It was followed by a constellation o'
fire-works and--Archie Sinclair must tell you what happened arter that,
for I misremember the whole on it.  The fire-works closed the scene to
me."

Archie, nothing loath, and with glistening eyes, took up the narrative
at this point, while the hero of the hour rekindled his pipe.

"The fact is," he said, "the gun had burst--was blown to atoms; not a
bit o' the barrel left, and a great lump o' the stock struck Jenkins on
the head, stunned him, and tumbled him off his horse."

"That was the magazine explosion and fire-works," explained Jenkins.

"But the queer thing was," continued Archie, "that the buffalo fell
dead, and, on examining it, we found that a bit o' the barrel had been
driven right into its brain."

"Ay, boy, but it was queerer still that none o' the pieces struck me or
my horse 'cept that bit o' the stock.  An' I'm none the worse, barrin'
this lump on the head, that only serves to cock my hat a little more to
one side than seems becomin' to a sober-minded man."

"We were sorry to be able to bring away so little o' the meat," said
Archie, with the gravity of an old hunter; "but, you see, it was too
late to send a cart for it after we got back."

"Never mind," said Dan Davidson, when the narrative was brought to a
close, "you have done very well for a beginning."

"Moreover," added Fergus, "it iss a goot feast the wolves will be havin'
on the plains this night, an' so, Archie, I'll be wishin' ye better luck
next time."


CHAPTER NINETEEN.

BRIGHT HOPES TERMINATE IN FURIOUS WAR.

Turning once again to the colony at Red River, we introduce the reader
to the Scotch settlers in the autumn of the year--at a time when there
was some appearance of the commencement of a season of prosperity, after
all the troubles that had befallen and surrounded, and well-nigh
overwhelmed them in time past.

The Davidson and McKay families had re-established themselves on their
farms, rebuilt their houses and planted their fields, and splendid crops
of all kinds were now flourishing, ready for spade and sickle.

The soil was found to be excellent.  In after years, forty-fold was no
uncommon return.  In one case, for a bushel of barley sown, fifty-six
bushels were reaped; and from a bushel of seed potatoes were obtained
one hundred and forty-five bushels!  Industry, however, had not at that
time been rewarded with such encouraging results, but there was
sufficient to indicate cheering prospects in the near future, and to
gladden the hearts of the pioneer settlers.

As a good number of these had, under the depressing influence of
disappointment and failure in the past, neglected to sow extensively,
not a few families were forced again to winter at Pembina, and draw
their supplies from the chase to avoid consuming all the seed which
alone ensured them against famine.  Among these were the Swiss families,
most of whom, being watch and clock makers, pastry-cooks, mechanics and
musicians, were not well adapted for agricultural pursuits.  Perhaps
they were as ill-adapted for the chase, but seed takes time to sow and
grow, whereas animals need no prolonged nursing--at least from man--and
are quickly killed if one can shoot.

The young leader of the Switzers, however, Andre Morel, soon left his
party at Pembina under the care of his lieutenant, and returned to Red
River Settlement, bent on mastering the details of husbandry, so as to
be able afterwards to direct the energies of his compatriots into a more
profitable occupation than the chase.

For this purpose, he sought and obtained employment with the Davidsons
in the new and enlarged edition of Prairie Cottage.  His sister, Elise,
was engaged by old McKay to act as companion and assistant to his
daughter Elspie.  Both the curly-haired Andre and the fair, blue-eyed
Elise, proved to be invaluable acquisitions in the households in which
they had found a home, for both were lively, intelligent companions,
hard workers at whatever they undertook, and were possessed of sweet
melodious voices.  Andre also performed on the violin, an instrument
which has played a prominent part in the wild Nor'-West ever since the
white-man set down his foot there.

"What do you think, Elspie, of my brother's plan, of taking the farm
just below this one, after he has had enough experience to be able to
work it himself?" asked Elise.

"It will be very nice to have him settled so near us.  Do you think he
will take the whole of it?"

"I think so.  You see, the terms on which the Earl has granted the land
are so easy, and the supplies of goods, oatmeal, clothing, and farm
implements sent us so generous, that Andre finds he will have money
enough to enable him to start.  Then, that strong, good-natured seaman,
Fred Jenkins, has actually agreed to serve as a man on the farm for a
whole year for nothing, except, of course, his food and lodging.  Isn't
it generous of him?"

"Do you know why he is going to serve him for nothing?" asked Elspie,
with a quick look and smile.

"No--I do not," returned fair little Elise with an innocent look.  "Do
you?"

"O no--of course I don't; I can only guess," replied her companion with
a light laugh.  "Perhaps it is because he knows his services as a farm
servant can't be worth much at first."

"There you are wrong," returned Elise, stoutly.  "No doubt he is
ignorant, as yet, about sowing and reaping and the like, but he is
wonderfully strong--just like a giant at lifting and carrying-and he has
become quite knowing about horses, and carting, and such things.  All
that he stipulates for is that he shall board in our house.  He says
he'll manage, somehow, to make enough money to buy all the clothes he
wants."

"What a delightful kind of servant," said Elspie, with an arch look,
which was quite thrown away on Elise, "and so disinterested to do it
without any reason."

"O! but he must have some reason, you know," rejoined Elise.  "I
shouldn't wonder if it was out of gratitude to my brother who was very
kind to him--so he says--the first time they met."

"Did he say that was his reason?" asked Elspie quickly.

"No, he did not say so, but he has said more than once that he feels
very grateful to my brother, and it has just occurred to me that that
may be his reason.  It would be very natural--wouldn't it?"

"Oh, very natural!--very!" returned the other.  "But d'you know, Elise,
I don't like your brother's plan at all."

"No! why?"

"Because, don't you see, foolish girl, that it will take you away from
me?  You will, of course, want to keep house for your brother, and I
have become so used to you, short though our intercourse has been, that
I don't see how I can get on at all without you?"

"Never mind, Elspie, dear.  It will be a long while before Andre is
ready to take the farm.  Besides, by that time, you know, you and Dan
will be married, so you won't miss me much--though I confess I should
like you to miss me a little."

Elspie sighed at this point.  "I suspect that our marriage will not be
so soon as you think, Elise," she said.  "Dan has tried to arrange it
more than once, but there seems to be a fate against it, for something
_always_ comes in the way!"

"Surely nothing will happen this time," said the sympathetic Elise.
"Everything begins to prosper now.  The crops are beautiful; the weather
is splendid; the house is ready to begin to--all the logs are cut and
squared.  Your father is quite willing, and Dan wishing for the day--
what more could you desire, Elspie?"

"Nothing; all seems well, but--" She finished the sentence with another
sigh.

While the two friends were thus conversing in the dairy, old McKay and
Dan Davidson were talking on the same subject in the hall of Ben Nevis.

"It iss a curious fact, Taniel," said the old man, with a pleased look,
"that it wass in this fery room in the old hoose that wass burnt, and
about the same time of the year, too, that you would be speakin' to me
about this fery thing.  An' I do not think that we will be troubled this
time wi' the Nor'-Westers, whatever--though wan never knows what a tay
may bring furth."

"That is the very reason, sir," said Davidson, "that I want to get
married at once, so that if anything does happen again I may claim the
right to be Elspie's protector."

"Quite right, my boy, quite right; though I must say I would like to
wait till a real munister comes out; for although Mr Sutherland iss a
fery goot man, an' an elder too, he iss not chust exactly a munister,
you know, as I have said before.  But have it your own way, Tan.  If my
little lass is willin', old Tuncan McKay won't stand in your way."

That night the inhabitants of Red River lay down to sleep in comfort and
to dream, perchance, of the coming, though long delayed, prosperity that
had hitherto so often eluded their grasp.

Next day an event occurred which gave the poor settlers new cause for
grief amounting almost to despair.

Dan Davidson and Elspie were walking on the verandah in front of Ben
Nevis at the time.  It was a warm sunny afternoon.  All around looked
the picture of peace and prosperity.

"Does it not seem, Dan, as if all the troubles we have gone through were
a dark dream--as if there never had been any reality in them?" said
Elspie.

"It does indeed seem so," responded Dan, "and I hope and trust that we
shall henceforth be able to think of them as nothing more than a
troubled dream."

"What iss that you will be sayin' about troubled dreams?" asked old
McKay, coming out of the house at the moment.

"We were just saying, daddy, that all our troubles seem--"

"Look yonder, Tan," interrupted the old man, pointing with his pipe-stem
to a certain part of the heavens.  "What iss it that I see?  A queer
cloud, whatever!  I don't remember seein' such a solid cloud as that in
all my experience."

"It is indeed queer.  I hope it's not what Fred Jenkins would call a
`squall brewin' up,' for that wouldn't improve the crops."

"A squall!" exclaimed Jenkins, who chanced to come round the corner of
the house at the moment, with a spade on his shoulder.  "That's never a
squall--no, nor a gale, nor a simoon, nor anything else o' the sort that
I ever heard of.  Why, it's growin' bigger an' bigger!"

He shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked earnestly at the object in
question, which did indeed resemble a very dense, yet not a black,
cloud.  For some moments the four spectators gazed in silence.  Then old
McKay suddenly dropped his pipe, and looked at Dan with an expression of
intense solemnity.

"It iss my belief," he said in a hoarse whisper, "that it is them wee
deevils the grasshoppers!"

A very few minutes proved old McKay's surmise to be correct.  Once
before, the colony had been devastated by this plague, and the memory of
the result was enough to alarm the most courageous among the settlers
who had experienced the calamity, though the new arrivals, being
ignorant, were disposed to regard the visitation lightly at first.
McKay himself became greatly excited when the air became darkened by the
cloud, which, ever increasing in size, rapidly approached.

"Haste ye, lads," he cried to some of the farm-servants who had joined
the group on the verandah, "get your spades, picks, an' shovels.  Be
smart now: it is not possible to save all the crops, but we may try to
save the garden, whatever.  Follow me!"

The garden referred to was not large or of great importance, but it was
a favourite hobby of the Highlander, and, at the time, was in full
bloom, luxuriant with fruit, flower, and vegetable.  To save it from
destruction at such a time, McKay would have given almost anything, and
have gone almost any lengths.  On this occasion, not knowing what to do,
yet impelled by his eagerness to do something, he adopted measures that
he had heard of as being used in other lands.  He ordered a trench to be
cut and filled with water on the side of his garden nearest the
approaching plague, which might--if thoroughly carried out--have been of
some use against wingless grasshoppers but could be of no use whatever
against a flying foe.  It would have taken an army of men to carry out
such an order promptly, and his men perceived this; but the master was
so energetic, so violent in throwing off his coat and working with his
own hand at pick and shovel, that they were irresistibly infected with
his enthusiasm, and set to work.

Old Duncan, did not, however, wield pick or shovel long.  He was too
excited for that.  He changed from one thing to another rapidly.  Fires
were to be kindled along the line of defence, and he set the example in
this also.  Then he remembered that blankets and other drapery had been
used somewhere with great effect in beating back the foe; therefore he
shouted wildly for his daughter and Elise Morel.

"Here we are, father: what can we do?"

"Go, fetch out all the blankets, sheets, table-cloths, an' towels in the
house, girls.  It iss neck or nothin' this tay.  Be smart, now!  Take
men to help ye."

Two men were very busy there piling up little heaps of firewood, namely,
Dan Davidson and Fred Jenkins.  What more natural than that these two,
on hearing the order given about blankets and table-cloths, etcetera,
should quit the fires and follow Elspie and Elise into the house!

In the first bedroom into which they entered they found Archie and
Billie Sinclair, the latter seated comfortably in an arm-chair close to
a window, the former wild with delight at the sudden demand on all his
energies.  For Archie had been one of the first to leap to the work when
old McKay gave the order.  Then he had suddenly recollected his little
helpless brother, and had dashed round to Prairie Cottage, got him on
his back, run with him to Ben Nevis Hall, placed him as we have seen in
a position to view the field of battle, and then, advising him to sit
quietly there and enjoy the fun, had dashed down-stairs to resume his
place in the forefront of battle!

He had run up again for a moment to inquire how Little Bill was getting
on, when the blanket and sheet searchers found them.

"All right," he exclaimed, on learning what they came for; "here you
are.  Look alive!  Don't stir, Little Bill!"

He hurled the bedding from a neighbouring bedstead as he spoke, tore
several blankets from the heap, and tumbled rather than ran down-stairs
with them, while the friends he had left behind followed his example.

By that time all the inmates and farm-servants of Prairie Cottage had
assembled at Ben Nevis Hall, attracted either by sympathy or curiosity
as to the amazing fracas which old McKay was creating.  Of course they
entered into the spirit of the preparations, so that when the enemy at
last descended on them they found the garrison ready.  But the defenders
might as well have remained quiet and gone to their beds.

Night was drawing near at the time, and was, as it were, precipitated by
the grasshoppers, which darkened the whole sky with what appeared to be
a heavy shower of snow.

The fires were lighted, water was poured into the trench, and the two
households fought with blanket, sheet, counterpane, and towel, in a
manner that proved the courage of the ancient heroes to be still
slumbering in men and women of modern days.

But what could courage do against such overwhelming odds?  Thousands
were slaughtered.  Millions pressed on behind.

"Don't give in, lads," cried the heroic and desperate Highlander,
wielding a great green blanket in a way that might have roused the
admiration if not the envy of Ajax himself.  "Keep it up, Jenkins!"

"Ay, ay, sir!" responded the nautical warrior, as he laid about him with
an enormous buffalo robe, which was the only weapon that seemed
sufficiently suited to his gigantic frame; "never say die as long as
there's a shot in the locker."

Elise stood behind him, lost in admiration, and giving an imbecile flap
now and then with a towel to anything that happened to come in front of
her.

Elspie was more self-possessed.  She tried to wield a jack-towel with
some effect, while Dan, Fergus, Duncan junior, Bourassin, Andre Morel,
and others ably, but uselessly, supported their heroic leader.  La
Certe, who chanced to be there at the time, went actively about
encouraging others to do their very best.  Old Peg made a feeble effort
to do what she conceived to be her duty, and Okematan stood by, calmly
looking on--his grave countenance exhibiting no symptom of emotion, but
his mind filled with intense surprise, not unmingled with pity, for the
Palefaces who displayed such an amount of energy in attempting the
impossible.

That self-defence, in the circumstances, was indeed impossible soon
became apparent, for the enemy descended in such clouds that they filled
up the half-formed ditch, extinguished the fires with their dead bodies,
defied the blanket-warriors, and swarmed not only into the garden of old
Duncan McKay but overwhelmed the whole land.

Darkness and exhaustion from the fight prevented the people of Ben Nevis
Hall and Prairie Cottage from at first comprehending the extent of the
calamity with which they had thus been visited, but enough had been seen
to convince McKay that his garden was doomed.  When he at last allowed
the sad truth to force itself into his mind he suffered Elspie to lead
him into the house.

"Don't grieve, daddy," she said, in a low comforting tone; "perhaps it
won't be as bad as it seems."

"Fetch me my pipe, lass," he said on reaching his bedroom.

"Goot-night to you, my tear," he added, on receiving the implement of
consolation.

"Won't you eat--or drink--something, daddy dear?"

"Nothing--nothing.  Leave me now.  We hev had a goot fight, whatever,
an' it iss to bed I will be goin' now."

Left alone the old man lay down in his warrior-harness, so to speak,
lighted his pipe, smoked himself into a sort of philosophical contempt
for everything under the sun, moon, and stars, and finally dropped his
sufferings, as well as his pipe, by falling into a profound slumber.

Next morning when the people of Red River arose, they became fully aware
of the disaster that had befallen them.  The grasshoppers had made what
Jenkins styled a clean sweep from stem to stern.  Crops, gardens, and
every green herb in the settlement had perished; and all the sanguine
hopes of the long-suffering settlers were blighted once more.

Before passing from this subject it may be as well to mention that the
devastating hosts which visited the colony at this time left behind them
that which turned out to be a worse affliction than themselves.  They
had deposited their larvae in the ground, and, about the end of the June
following, countless myriads of young grasshoppers issued forth to
overrun the fields.  They swarmed in such masses as to be two, three,
and--in some places near water--even four inches deep.  Along the rivers
they were found in heaps like sea-weed, and the water was almost
poisoned by them.  Every vegetable substance was devoured--the leaves
and even bark of trees were eaten up, the grain vanished as fast as it
appeared above ground, everything was stripped to the bare stalk, and
ultimately, when they died in myriads, the decomposition of their dead
bodies was more offensive than their living presence.

Thus the settlers were driven by stress of misfortune once again to the
plains of Pembina, and obliged to consort with the Red-men and the
half-breeds, in obtaining sustenance for their families by means of the
gun, line, trap, and snare.


CHAPTER TWENTY.

LITTLE BILL BECOMES A DIFFICULTY.

We must now pass over another winter, during which the Red River
settlers had to sustain life as they best might--acquiring, however, in
doing so, an expertness in the use of gun and trap and fishing-line, and
in all the arts of the savages, which enabled them to act with more
independence, and to sustain themselves and their families in greater
comfort than before.

Spring, with all its brightness, warmth, and suggestiveness had returned
to cheer the hearts of men; and, really, those who have never
experienced the long six-or-eight-months' winter of Rupert's Land can
form no conception of the feelings with which the body--to say nothing
of the soul--opens up and expands itself, so to speak, in order to
receive and fully appreciate the sweet influences of spring.

For one thing, seven or eight months of cold, biting, steely frost
causes one almost to forget that there ever was such a thing as summer
heat, summer scents, summer sounds, or summer skies.  The first thaw is
therefore like the glad, unexpected meeting of a dear old friend; and
the trumpet voice of the first goose, the whirring wing of the first
duck, and the whistle of the first plover, sounds like the music of the
spheres to one's long unaccustomed ears.  Then the trickle of water
gives one something like a new sensation.  It may be but a thread of
liquid no thicker than a pipe-stem faintly heard by an attentive ear
tinkling in the cold depths far under the ice or snow, but it is liquid,
not solid, water.  It is suggestive of motion.  It had almost been
forgotten as a sound of the long past which had forsaken the terrestrial
ball for ever.

It does not take a powerful imagination to swell a tiny stream to a
rivulet, a river, a lake, a mighty ocean.  Shut your eyes for a moment,
and, in memory, the ice and snow vanish; the streams flow as in the days
of old; flowers come again to gladden the eyes and--but why trouble you,
good reader, with all this?  We feel, sadly, that unless you have tasted
the northern winter no description, however graphic, will enable you to
drink in the spirit of the northern spring.

About this time Okematan, the Cree chief, took it into his head that he
would go a-hunting.

This last word does not suggest to a dweller in the wilderness that
crossing of ploughed lands on horseback, and leaping of hedges,
etcetera, which it conveys to the mind of an Englishman.  The Cree
chief's notion of spring-hunting was, getting into a birch-bark canoe,
with or without a comrade, and going forth on the lakes and rivers of
the wilderness with plenty of powder and shot, to visit the native home
of the wild-goose, the wild-duck, the pelican, the plover, and the swan.

For such a trip not much is essential.  Besides the gun and ammunition
referred to, Okematan carried a blanket, a hatchet, several extra pairs
of moccasins, a tin kettle in which to boil food, a fire-bag for steel,
flint, and tinder, with a small supply of tobacco.

On hearing of his intention, Dan Davidson resolved to accompany him.
Dan had by that time associated so much with the chief that he had
learned to speak his language with facility.  Indeed nearly all the
settlers who had a turn for languages had by that time acquired a
smattering more or less of Indian and French.

"You see," said Dan to the chief, "there is not much doing on the farm
just now, and I want to see a little of the country round about, so, if
you don't object to my company, I'd like to go."

"The Cree chief will be proud to have the company of the Paleface
chief," replied the Indian, with grave courtesy.

Dan wanted to say "All right," but was ignorant of the Cree equivalent
for that familiar phrase; he therefore substituted the more sober and
correct, "It is well."

"But," said he, "you must not call me a Paleface chief, for I am only an
ordinary man in my own land--what you would call one of the braves."

"Okematan is thought to have a good judgment among his people," returned
the Indian, "though he has not the snows of many winters on his head,
and he thinks that if Dan'el had stayed in the wigwams of his people
beyond the Great Salt Lake, he would have been a chief."

"It may be so, Okematan, though I doubt it," replied Dan, "but that is a
point which cannot now be proved.  Meanwhile, my ambition at present is
to become a great hunter, and I want you to teach me."

The chief, who was gratified by the way in which this was put, gladly
agreed to the proposal.

"There is another man who would like to go with us," said Davidson.  "My
friend, Fergus McKay, is anxious, I know, to see more of the lands of
the Indian.  You have no objection to his going, I suppose?--in another
canoe of course, for three would be too many in your small canoe."

I thought dead, Gabriel, in those distant lands, and more than once
I have prayed for your poor soul, what you need.

_compañero_ The eyes showed their appreciation for these words. - Thank
you, Stephen.

I admire your faith, but I have not left cree as good as you think of
that grim adventure.

Best had been killed. The aura of martyrdom that is worth going into
a dungeon and quit being a man made a pingajo. I am very ill, Stephen:
My death sentence is irrevocable. I have no stomach, my lungs are
broken, this body you see is a ramshackle machine that barely works,
and cracks all over as if the pieces were falling apart and every one
by his side. The Virgin who saved me by your good recommendation could
have intervened a little more for me, softening my guardian.

Believed to save the wretched world giving in to the instincts of sleeping
beast within us as remnants of the past ... Then, in full freedom,
life has been more painful than death.

Upon returning to Spain, pushed by poverty and persecution, my life has
been hell. I could not stop at any place where men gather.

Hound dogs like me, want to live outside the cities, I corner, push
the bush into the desert, where there are no humans.

It seems that I am a fearsome man, the more fearsome than the desperate
throw bombs, because I am, because I have an irresistible force
in me that makes me just spread the truth, I am in the presence
of two unfortunate ....

But this is over. You can calm, brother.

I am dead, my mission came to an end, but others will come behind me and
others. The path is open and the seeds in their guts.

Germinal ¡! So shouted a friend of mine from exile in Spain where he
saw the last ray of sunshine from the stage of the gallows .... I'm
going to die, and I believe with the right to rest for a few months.

I would like for the first time in my life the sweetness of the silence
and immobility, of unknown not be anybody, nobody knows me not inspire
sympathy or fear. I would like to be a statue of the cover, a
pilaster of the cathedral, which is still on slippery surfaces
with time, the joys and sorrows, without causing shivering or
emotions.

Anticipating death, being dead to breathe and eat, but do not think, nor
suffering, nor was thrilled: this would be bliss for me, brother.

I do not know where to go, with men waiting for me beyond this door
for hounding me again ...

I want you ...? The _Vara of palo_ for any defense, pushed lovingly
Gabriel. - Come on up, fool! Do not die, I will move forward. What you
need is calm and caring.

The cathedral will cure you. Here sanarás that sick head, which seems
to Don Quixote. Do you remember as a child when we leías its history
in the evenings ...? Go ahead, fanciful. What do you care that the
world be better managed or worse?

Thus we find, and always will be.

What matters is to live as Christians, with the certainty that the
Hereafter is better, as that is the work of God and not of men.

Get up, come up!

And lovingly pushing the bum, left the cloister for the beggars, who
had followed with curious eyes to hear the interview without a word.

Crossed the street, entering the staircase of the tower. The steps
were of red brick and expended, and the walls painted white, covered
in all its grotesque drawings and riots convoluted inscriptions of
people who came to the tower attracted by the fame of the Campana
Gorda.

Gabriel was slowly panting and stopping at each step. - I'm bad,
Esteban ... very bad.

This makes bellows air everywhere. Then, as repentant of his forgetfulness,
was quick to ask: - And Pepa, your wife? I guess that is good .... he is
the head of the employee of the cathedral and its pusiéronse glassy eyes,
as if to mourn. - Died - said with grim brevity. Gabriel stopped, grabbing
the railing, as fixed by surprise.

After a short silence, he added, wishing to console her brother: But
tabernacle, my niece, will be made a beauty. The last time I saw looked
like a queen, with her blond bun and that rosy face, golden hair, like
an apricot from cigarrales. Was married to the cadet or ishment? _Vara
The gesture of palo_ put more sombre and his brother looked grim. -
Also died - said in a drought. - Sagrario has also died - asked, Gabriel
surprised. - He died for me, and the same thing ....

Brother, so more thoughts in the world, I do not talk about it.
Gabriel realized that waking up with a big penalty questions and
said no more, taking the rise again. In the life of his brother had
something serious in his absence one of these events that dissolve
and separate families forever to survive.

Crossed the bow deck of the gallery and the Archbishop entered
the upper cloister, called the Clavería: four gates equal in length
to those of the lower cloister, but bare of all decoration and
looks miserable.

The floor was worn and broken bricks. The four sides that they had a garden
on the railing between the columns supporting the flat roof of ancient
beams. Work was a temporary, three centuries earlier, which had been
provided for in this state.

Along the whitewashed walls abríanse symmetry without doors and windows
in rooms that had been seized the servers of the cathedral, housing
and informally transmitted from father to son.

The cloister, with its low arcades, offering the appearance of four
blocks, each of which had only one row of houses.

Opposite was the flat colonnade, whose railings peeked his glasses
pointed cypresses in the garden.

Above the roof of the cloister veíanse the windows of the second row
of rooms, as almost all the houses had two floors Clavería. He was a
people living on the level of the cathedral roof, and at night and
closed the staircase of the tower remained isolated from the city.

The tribe is semieclesiástica procreate and die in the heart of Toledo,
without descending to the streets, by adhering to traditional instinct
that mountain of white stone and set, where the arches served as a
refuge.

Lived saturated odor of incense and perfume breathed special iron
rust and old cathedrals, without horizon or warheads across the bell,
which crushed his mole with a piece of heaven that he was from the
upper cloister. The _compañero_ Luna suddenly thought back to
childhood.

Chicuelo like Gabriel were playing for the past four galleries and sat
at the Time of the cloister surrounded by the first rays of the sun. Women
who reminded him of his mother shook the blankets on the garden beds of
red brick or neighborhood immediately to their homes.

The _compañero_ was still fuzzy on the wall two stooge who had painted
with coal when she was eight years. No mere children screaming and chasing
laughed, had believed that life was on hold in this corner of the cathedral,
as if those people born almost no air and no one died.

The _Vara of palo_, cejijunto and gloomy words from the past wanted
to give some explanations for his brother. - I live in our house
forever.

I have left in the account to the memory of his father. We must thank
the gentlemen of the town, considering that I am no more a sad .... _Vara
of palo_ Since it was the "disgrace" that I have a fixes the old
house, and lives with me Don Luis, the teacher of chapel.

Now you know: a young priest, much worth, here is obscured, a soul
from God, you are crazy and live in the cathedral as an angel.

They entered the house of the Moon, which was the best of Clavería. Beside
the door, two rows of pots in the form of a watch, nailed to the
wall, let the hair hang green plants.

Inside, the room that served as reception, Gabriel found him all the
same during the life of their parents. The white walls, which over
the years had taken a brown color of bone, were decorated with old
engravings of saints.

Mahogany stalls, bright by the continuous rubbing, offered a youthful
appearance, which contrasted with the curves of the early twentieth
century and their seats next to desfondarse.

For a door was the kitchen, where his brother had come to give
orders to a timid-looking old woman.

In one corner of the room was sheathed a sewing machine.

Luna had been working on it to his niece the last time I went through the
cathedral. It was the permanent reminder that he had left the "small" one
disaster after the father woke pain grim.

When using a window of the room Gabriel was the inner courtyard, which
was desirable that all the room between the Clavería: a free air
space, with superior rooms supported by four rows of slender stone
columns, giving the patio looks like a small cloister.

Esteban then met his brother. - You say you want lunch. In the kitchen
everything is ready. Calls a man, called by that mouth. Although
poor, have little power if you do not sack afloat, that aspect of
quitándote dead resurrected. Gabriel smiled sadly. - It is useless to
you hard. My stomach over.

You only have a little milk, and because it supports. Stephen gave
orders to the old down to the city in search of milk, and when he went
to sit next to his brother, opened the door facing the cloister, hovering
by the head of a young man. - Good days, man!

- exclaimed. I had a dog and a flat profile, the eyes were of malice,
combed and glossy tufos stuck above the ears. - Pasa lost passes
- _Vara of palo_ said.

And he added, addressing his brother: - You know who this is ...? No?
As the son of our poor brother, that God has in his glory.

Lives in the upper room of the cloister with his mother, who washes
the clothes of Mr. choir canons and curls around sobrepellices
giving joy to see them ....

Tom, boy, I greet. It's your uncle Gabriel, who has just returned from
America, and Paris, and that I know where! Lands that are far, far
away.

The boy Gabriel greeted, somewhat intimidated by the side of that sad and
sick relatives, which had heard his mother as being a mysterious and
romantic. - Here where you can see - Stephen went to his brother
and showing the boy - is the worst head of the cathedral.

Mr Workman canon more than once as it had feet on the street were it
not for consideration to the memory of his father and his grandfather
and that carries the family name, because everybody knows that the
Moon is in the old cathedral as stones of the walls ....

Does not think of the skull that do not perform in full as an unholy
swearing sacristy behind Mr. benefit.

Do not say no, rascal! And threatening him with one hand, and between
severe smiling, as if the substance of his thought made him some
grace failures nephew.

He welcomed the reprimand with a face that his face waved simiesca
mobility and lower eyes, which had a fixity insolent. - It's a shame
bad - continued Uncle - you and combs, as the court chulería comes to
the big parties in Toledo. In the good times of the cathedral and you
had to peel monkfish. But in this time of confiscation, freedom and
misfortunes, our holy church is poor as a rat, the misery is not humor
for the lords of the council look at details, and everything goes down
to feel sorry. What abandonment, Gabriel! If I saw! This seems like such
an office in Madrid where people go to charge and gets to run away.

The cathedral is beautiful as always, but is not by any cult of the majesty
of the Lord. The same teacher said the chapel, outraged at
seeing the big parties only take place in the choir until half a dozen
musicians.

Young people living in Clavería is not our first love and complains that
the shorts are the salaries, without taking into account the time enduring
religion. If this continues, I am not surprised to see this bird and
others like him so tunantes to play hopscotch on the cruise ... God
forgive me! _Vara And just made a gesture of palo_ shocked by his
words. Then continued: - This gentleman, here you see, are not happy
with his condition, and it is almost a kid, took the position that
his poor father could not get up to thirty years.

Want to be a bullfighter, and even ventured out Sunday in a heifer
on the Place de Toledo.

His mother dropped as a disheveled Magdalena contármelo to all, and
I think that his father had died and I do it in their stead, he
looked back when Mr pouring the square of handsome, and meaning
from the staircase of the tower until his room with the wooden stick
that I served in the cathedral.

He will tell you if I have the strong hand when I was angry
.... ¡Virgen del Sagrario! A Luna First Church of the Holy gotten a
bullfighter! Little laughed the canons and to Mr. Cardinal, I am
told to sit on the case! Benefited from a good mood since he dubbed
the _Tato_, and they call everyone in the house. Did you see,
brother, what gives honor to the family this Tuno ...

The silence was intended to annihilate the _Tato_ your eyes, but he
smiled, not very much impressed with the words of his uncle. - Do not
Think Gabriel - continued - that this individual is missing a piece of
bread and why does such nonsense. Despite his poor head, is the twenty
years since the position of dogcatcher of the holy cathedral: it is
only where in better times came after many years and good handles.
Cobra realitas its six newspapers, and as the loose by the church,
can teach attractions to outsiders.

With tips that fall is better than me.

Foreigners who visit the cathedral, people descomulgadas we look like
monkeys are rare and all our interesting and worthy of laughter,
laying down in it. The UK has been asked if Toreador, and he hold it
... you need more! Seeing that they give for the pleasure, let the
bag of lies (lying because no one misses the foot over) and has great
bearing runs out in Toledo and beyond, bulls who died ... and those
of England bobalicones notes on their albums, and even some bigeye
blonde draws a line head of this trapalón.

He is interested in what you believe the lies and end it a long peseta;
cares little that these heretics are to be spreading to their land in
the Cathedral of Toledo, in the First Church of Spain, the employees
are toreros and help from religious ceremonies and run run.

Total, which earns more money than me, and despite this, cree back in
office ...
"Well, then, I vote for encamping on the small island over there, in the
middle o' the lake--for it's far more like a lake than a river
hereabouts--that one over which the hawk is hovering."

"I vote for it too," said Archie.

"So do I," chimed in Little Bill.

"I will be sayin' ditto to that," put in Fergus.

"Moreover," suggested Dan, "I vote for roasting the goose at once."

"Ay, and eating him right away," said Archie.  As the invalid followed
this up with a feeble cheer, the proposal was carried into effect
without delay.

The islet was low and flat, and so thickly covered with bush that it
afforded a most enticing spot for a night-encampment.  There was also
plenty of dead wood on it, with which to replenish the fire, and various
peeps through sundry openings afforded exquisite views of woodland and
river with which to charm the eyes.  Over all, the sun was pouring his
noontide rays in a glorious flood.

We need not waste time in going into the details of the feast that
followed: how the goose was delightfully plump and tender--especially
tender to teeth that would have scarcely observed the difference if it
had been tough--how, in addition to the goose, they had wild-ducks
enough--shot earlier in the day--to afford each one a duck to himself,
leaving a brace over, of which Okematan ate one, as well as his share of
the goose, and seemed to wish that he might eat the other, but he
didn't, for he restrained himself; how they drank tea with as much gusto
and intemperance as if it had been a modern "afternoon"; and how, after
all was over, the Red-man filled the pipe-head on the back of his iron
tomahawk and began to smoke with the air of a man who meant business and
regarded all that had gone before as mere child's-play.

The afternoon was well advanced when the feast was concluded, for
appetites in the wilderness are not easily or soon satisfied.

"I feel tight," said Billie with a sigh and something of pathos in his
tone, when he at last laid down his knife--we cannot add fork, for they
scorned such implements at that time.

"That's right, Little Bill," said Archie, "try another leg or wing--now,
don't shake your head.  We've come on this trip a-purpose to make you
fat an' strong.  So you must--here, try this drum-stick.  It's only a
little one, like yourself, Billie."

"True, Archie, but I'm too little to hold it.  I feel like an egg now."

"Hallo!  Oke, are you overcome already?" asked Archie.

"The sun sinks to rest at night and the birds go to sleep.  If we intend
to hunt we must begin now."

"It's always the way," returned the boy with an air of discontent;
"whenever a fellow gets into a state of extreme jollity there's sure to
be something bothersome to come and interrupt us.  Obfusticate your
faculties with some more smoke, Oke, till Billie and I finish our tea.
We can't shoot with half-empty stomachs, you know."

"They must be three-quarters full by this time--whatever," remarked
Fergus, wiping his clasp-knife on the grass.

Just then, Dan Davidson, who had gone to explore the islet, returned
with the information that some hunters must have recently visited the
same place, for he had discovered the remains of an encampment at the
extreme eastern side, which looked as if it had been recently occupied,
for bones of wild-fowl were scattered about, the meat on which was
neither dried nor decayed.

On hearing this, Okematan rose quickly, put out his pipe, and stuck the
tomahawk in his belt.  The sluggish good-natured air of contentment with
which he had been smoking vanished; the half-sleepy eyes opened, and a
frown rested on his brow as he said, shortly--

"Okematan goes to look."

"May I go with you?" asked Dan.

"No.  Okematan goes alone.  It is known that a band of Saulteaux have
been seen.  They are roused just now by the actions of the great white
chief and the words of my Nation.  Rest here till I come.  Go on eating.
If they are here they may be watching us now."

"D'ee hear that, Little Bill?  You've got to go on eating," said Archie.
"Our guide commands it.  If you disobey, the rascally Saulteaux will
come down upon us somehow."

But Archie's light-heartedness was not shared by his older companions.
They knew too well that the disturbed state of the country at the time,
and especially the ill-will engendered between the Crees and Saulteaux
by the ill-advised action of Lord Selkirk's agents, rendered an
explosion not improbable at any time, and a certain feeling of
disappointment came over them when they reflected that the hunting
expedition, which they had entered on with so much enthusiastic hope,
might perhaps be brought to an abrupt close.

"If there's to be any fighting I shall only be in your way," said the
invalid in a tone in which there was much of sadness, though none of
fear.

"Not a bit of it, Little Bill," returned Dan, quickly.  "You'll be in
nobody's way in the canoes.  You're as light as a feather.  If we had
even to take to the bush, Archie could run with you; an' when he gets
tired, Fergus and I would think no more o' you than a grasshopper."

"Iss it carryin' him you will be taalkin' of?" said Fergus.  "Ay, ay!  I
would be forgettin' that he wass on my back if I had him there."

As he spoke, the Indian returned to the camp with the cat-like tread so
characteristic of the Red-man.

"A big band has been here," he said.  "They slept on the island last
night, and the signs show that they do not come as friends."

"Are you sure of that?" asked Dan.

"Okematan is sure of nothing.  Even the sun may not rise to-morrow."

"Had we not better, then, return at once to the Settlement, and tell
what we have seen?" said Dan.

"If we did, the Saulteaux would see us and give chase.  Their canoes are
big and have strong men in them.  They would overtake us soon and our
scalps would be swinging at their belts to-morrow."

"Not pleesant to think of--whatever," said Fergus.

"What, then, do you advise?" asked Dan.  "You understand the ways of the
wilderness, and we will follow your lead."

The chief appeared to think for a few moments.

"We will remain where we are," he said; "only we will send the boys off
in one of the canoes, as if to shoot some ducks for us.  The Saulteaux
will think that we are lazy, idle men, who like to lie in camp and sleep
or smoke while the boys hunt for us.  When night comes we will escape in
the dark and go down the river to warn the settlers."

"But what if they attack us before night comes on?" asked Dan.

"They will not do that," answered the Indian, gravely.  "They know that
we are well supplied with powder and shot.  They know that some one must
lead in every attack, and that such leaders would be doomed to death.
Saulteaux do not love death.  They prefer life.  They will not come till
it is dark."

"Ha! ha!" laughed Fergus, who seemed greatly tickled with the latter
part of the chief's observation, "fery goot! ho! fery goot!--they do not
love death, an' it iss life they will be preferrin'.  Ay, ay!  It iss
the Heelandman that will be of much the same opeenion, only, when
fightin' hes got to be done, he's not afraid to do it in daylight."

"He may not be afraid, Fergus," said Dan, "yet I suspect that the
Red-man's tactics are often the wisest, for what would be the use of
making an attack in daylight, at the cost of several lives, when the
attack might be made quite as well, if not better, at night, without the
loss, perhaps, of any life at all?"

"I will not be sayin'," returned Fergus, who was of an argumentative
disposition, "anything at all about attackin' by day or by night.  I
will only be remarkin' that the Heelandman iss like the savitch in that
he prefers life to death."

"Come along to the fire, Fergus," said Dan, laughing; "I will argue that
out with you."

"It will be difficult to argue, then, for there iss no argument in it at
all.  It is only a statement of opeenion."

"Well, but surely it is possible to controvert your opinion!  Besides,
we are somewhat exposed where we stand.  Even an arrow might reach us
from the near bank."

"Never you fear, Tan.  They will not be so foolish as to fire now,
instead of attack at night.  They are sly--whatever."

While the two friends were thus conversing, the Cree chief was arranging
the smaller of the canoes for the use of the young hunters--that is, he
took out all the lading, making it so light that it would skim over the
water like an egg-shell with the slightest impulse of the paddle.

"You'll have to put a big stone in the stern, Oke," said Archie, "to
make up for Little Bill's lightness--"

"For your heaviness, you mean," interrupted the invalid.

"No; I mean what I say, Billie, for you are light-headed as well as
light-hearted--a sort o' human balloon, ready to go up like a rocket at
any time--so that even an or'nary man like me weighs you down.  Besides,
Oke, he steers better than me and I shoot better than him.  Also, I like
the hardest work, so I always take the bow."

Arranging things according to directions, the Indian held the canoe
steady while the brothers stepped carefully in--for they had learned
from experience that the birch-bark canoe, besides being easily broken,
is apt to overturn on small provocation.

"Let not Arch-ee go near the river-bank on either side," said the chief
in a warning voice, as he was about to shove the frail bark out upon the
glassy water.  "The Saulteaux might catch him.  And let him not go far
up or down stream.  Let him keep among the reeds round the island.
There are many ducks there.  Shoot plenty, as if Arch-ee had no
suspicion--no fear of Indians."

"I say, Oke," demanded the lad, with what was meant for an overwhelming
frown, "do you mean to hint that I _have_ any fear of the Indians?"

"Okematan has the belief that Arch-ee never knew fear at all," returned
the chief, earnestly; "that he has the courage of the young
buffalo-bull."

"Well, I'm not quite so sure o' that," returned the boy, with a modest
look.  "I would not myself put it quite so strong, you know.  But you're
a wise chief, and I hope you've got a lot of brothers as wise as
yourself.  Good-bye, Oke--shove off.  Now, then, mind how you steer,
Little Bill."


CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.

CIRCUMVENTING THE RED-SKINS.

For some time the brothers paddled about the sedgy shore of the small
islet on which the camp had been pitched, now setting up a flock of
ducks and then slipping into the heart of some reeds and concealing
themselves until a good chance was obtained at a passing flock of geese.

Archie Sinclair soon laid in enough provision to serve the party for a
few meals, for his hand was steady and his eye true.

"Little Bill," he said, looking back after one of his successful shots,
"you must take a shot now.  We will go right-about-face, and convert the
bow into the stern in the usual way.  See, catch hold of the gun."

"No, Arch-ee, as Oke calls you, I won't; I'm quite content to look on,
for your gun kicks like a Mexican mule.  Besides, it's easy work to
steer, and seeing you panting and toiling in the bow makes it seem all
the easier.  Just you keep blazin' away, old man.  But, I say, where
shall I steer to now?  I'm tired o' steering among the reeds.  Let us
push out into the clear water."

"You heard what Oke said," objected Archie; "we must keep well clear o'
both shores."

"I know that," returned Billie, "but he did not forbid us to try the
reeds round the other islands; there's a much bigger one, not a quarter
of a mile up stream.  I think there are some beautiful sedges there
where geese are likely to live.  I'm sure I would choose to live in such
a place if I was a goose."

"O! then, we must go, Little Bill, for I think it would be hard to keep
any one out of his native home."

So saying, he dipped his paddle with vigour, and the light bark shot
swiftly over the glancing water.

The sun was beginning to descend towards the western horizon when they
drew near to the island, and several flocks of water-fowl had already
sprung alarmed from the reeds, when Archie caught sight of a
black-and-red-painted visage peering at him from among the bushes.

The boy's heart seemed to bound into his throat and his first impulse
was to turn the canoe and fly, but Archie's mind was quicker even than
his hand or eye.  All he had ever heard or read of the cool stoicism of
the Red-man seemed to flash across his memory, and, with a violent
effort, he crushed back the shout that rose to his lips.  He could not
indeed suppress the look of sudden surprise that swept across his
expressive face, but he cleverly adapted it to circumstances.

"Look, look!  Little Bill," he exclaimed, eagerly, pointing right over
the Indian's head at a flock of geese that opportunely appeared at the
moment in the far distance.  "Crouch, Bill, lie low, I'll call them.
The disciples were hiding with increasing commitment to its isolation
from the tower.

at the Cathedral ...?

The older guard, who was a civil guard, he is tired and goes to his
people.

It seems that since the dog died he took antipathy to the service. The
other guard is enfermucho and partner needs. You want to be you? If
we were in winter, anything you say. Coughs too down for the night.
But in summer, the cathedral is the coolest place in Toledo. ¡Big nights!

claiming his poor health. Only would the surveillance as long as the
summer.

Moreover, they were two pesetas a day, almost more than they earned

that prompted him to accept any job to avoid being burdensome to

stars.

which, enlarged by the reflection, became grotesque grimaces. Calm night
and darkness wrapped in sweet caress Gabriel and tabernacle. Descended
from on high that freshness that seems mysterious to revive the spirit
and larger memories. The church was for them as a huge beast and

the past, to convince the young that anything worth its work in
the cathedral.

He had suffered a lot. There was no bitterness that would taste. Had been
hungry, really hungry, their pilgrimages in the world.
We must keep up the
game a bit longer yet.  It won't do to hurry back till the sun is lower,
so we'll go over to that small island there an' have a try for another
duck.  There's sure to be nobody on such a small island as that.
Afterwards we'll drop down in an off-hand, idle-like way to the
encampment.  It'll be natural to do this when the evenin's beginning to
set in, an' so we'll stump them Red-skins at their own game.  D'ee
understand?"

"Yes.  You're a clever chap, Archie."

In pursuance of this deeply laid plan, the brothers crossed over to the
small islet referred to, and, after apparently amusing themselves there
for a short time, dropped down stream in a leisurely way, reaching the
encampment before the evening had fairly set in.

A council of war was immediately held.

"You were right in your guess, Okematan," said Davidson.  "The reptiles
will be down on us to-night no doubt.  What course does the Cree chief
advise?"

"Okematan advises that the kettle be boiled, the duck roasted, and a
good big supper eaten."

"It iss fery pleasant advice, no doubt," said Fergus with a broad and
rather sarcastic grin, "but it iss not warlike!"

"It seems not a bad preparation for war, anyhow," said Dan; "and what
after that?"

"The two boys will sleep and rest while food is preparing," continued
the chief.  "The moon will set before we have done eating, and it will
be very dark.  The Saulteaux will not attack while the light lasts.
When it is quite dark we will go."

"If we fix to leave and they chance to attack at the same time, it iss
meetin' them we will be, Okematan," said Fergus.

To this remark the Indian vouchsafed no reply.

"Well, well, Muster Okematan, it iss your own business; you will know
best yourself.  I will see to stowin' away my supper--whatever."

By the time supper was over, the moon had descended into a bank of black
clouds on the horizon, and profound darkness brooded over land and
water.  It was a night such as an attacking party would hail as being
most suitable for its work, and of course was proportionately unsuitable
for the attacked.  The Indian chief displayed no more concern about it
than if nothing unusual were pending.  After supper, however, he
directed that the canoes should be launched and loaded.  At the same
time he gathered together as much wood as he could, and heaped it on the
fire.

"You seem determined to give them plenty of light to do their work,"
remarked Davidson.

"They will wait till our fire burns low," said the chief.  "By that time
they will think we are asleep.  A sleeping foe is not dangerous.  They
will come--slowly; step by step; with wide eyes glancing from side to
side, and no noise, sly as foxes; timid as squaws!  But by that time we
will be far on our way back to Red River!"

"Ay--if we do not meet them comin' to attack us," said Fergus.

"And how shall we proceed!" asked Dan.

"As we came," answered the chief.  "Okematan, with the two boys, will
lead.  Dan-ell an' Fergus will follow.  Come."

Led by their guide, the party passed out of the firelight into the dense
thicket by which the spot was encompassed almost completely, so that the
only visible sign of the encampment from outside was the forks of flame
and sparks which rose high above the bushes.

On reaching the shore they found the two boys holding the canoes, close
to the land.  So intense was the darkness that they could not see the
boys or canoes at all till close beside them.  Without uttering a word,
or making a sound with their moccasined feet, they stepped into the
canoes, pushed gently off and glided, ghost-like, into the vast
obscurity.


CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.

A MIDNIGHT CHASE, AND DAN IN EXTREMITY.

For some time they advanced in absolute silence, dipping their paddles
so as to make no noise whatever; Dan following as close as possible in
the wake of the chief, for it was one of those nights which people
describe as being so dark that one cannot see one's hand before one's
face.

On reaching the lower end of the lake-like expansion where the river
narrowed suddenly and the stream began to be felt, it was discovered
that the enemy was in advance of them--that, anticipating some such
attempt at escape, they had stationed an ambush at the narrows to cut
off their retreat.

Archie was naturally the first to make this discovery, being in the bow
of the canoe.  He heard no sound, but suddenly there loomed out of the
darkness another canoe close to them--so close that they were on the
point of running into it when the sharp-witted boy saw it, and, with an
adroit turn of his paddle prevented a collision.  Then he ceased to
paddle, and held his breath.  Not knowing what to do next he wisely did
nothing, but left matters to Oke and fate!

As they passed, the steersman in the strange canoe uttered something in
a low tone.  Evidently he mistook them for his friends.

"Sh!" was Okematan's prompt reply--or the Indian equivalent for that
caution.

They glided silently and slowly past, but the suspicion of the strange
Indian had obviously been aroused, for the paddles of his canoe were
heard to gurgle powerfully.  Hearing this, Okematan made a stroke that
sent his canoe ahead like an arrow, and Archie, who appreciated the
situation, seconded the movement.

"Stop!" exclaimed the strange Indian, in the Saulteaux tongue, but the
Cree chief did not feel the duty of obedience strongly upon him just
then.  On the contrary, he put forth all his strength, but quietly, for
he remembered that Dan Davidson was behind.

As there was now no need for concealment, the pursuer uttered a shrill
war-whoop which was immediately answered and repeated until the woods
rang with the fiendish sound, while half-a-dozen canoes dashed out from
the banks on either side, and sought to bar the river.

"Now, Arch-ee," said the Cree chief in a low voice, "paddle for your
life and be a man!"

"I'll be two men, if you like, Oke," answered the boy, whose courage was
of that type which experiences something almost like desperate glee in
the presence of imminent danger.

The canoe, obedient to the double impulse and the power of the current,
was soon out of hearing of the pursuers.

"O! if I only had a paddle I might help you," said Little Bill eagerly.

"Yes, an' bu'st your biler, or explode your lungs, or something o' that
sort," said his brother.  "No, no, Little Bill; you sit there like a
lord or an admiral, an' leave men like Oke an' me to do all the dirty
work."

While he spoke thus flippantly it is but justice to say that Archie was
never more anxiously in earnest in his life, and that he strained at his
paddle with a degree of energy that made him, perhaps, more than equal
to many an average man.  So that the canoe forged well ahead of the
pursuers and finally got to a part of the river where three islets
divided it into several channels, rendering further pursuit in the dark
useless if not impossible.

Their comrades, however, were not so fortunate.  Left behind by the
sudden spurt of his leader, Davidson and his companion exerted
themselves to overtake him, but the canoes of the enemy, which were just
too late to cut off the retreat of Okematan, were in time to intercept
the second canoe.  In this emergency Dan swerved aside, hoping to get to
the bank before the Saulteaux could discover his exact whereabouts.  His
intentions were thwarted by the want of caution in his companion.

"Iss it to the land ye are going?" asked Fergus.

"Yes--it's our only chance," whispered Dan.

"It iss my opeenion--" murmured the Highlander.

"Hush!" ejaculated Dan.

But the caution came too late.  A listening Red-skin overheard the
sounds, and, with a sudden dash was alongside of them.  He did not,
however, know the vigour of the men with whom he had to deal.  While he
was in the very midst of a triumphant war-whoop, Dan cut him over the
head with the paddle so violently that the instrument became splinters,
and the whoop ceased abruptly.  At the same time Fergus caught hold of
the bow of the enemy's canoe with an iron grasp, and, giving it a heave
that might have put Samson to shame, fairly overturned it.

"Ye can wet your whustle now--whatever," he muttered.

As he spoke, the canoe ran with extreme violence against the invisible
bank.  At the same moment a random volley was fired from the canoes in
rear.  Fear lest they should wound or kill a comrade probably caused
them to send the whizzing bullets rather high, but for one instant the
flame revealed the position of the fugitives, and those who had reserved
their fire took better aim.

"Take to the bush, Fergus!" cried Dan, as he grasped his gun and leaped
into the shallow water.

The Highlander stooped to lay hold of his weapon, which lay in the bow
of the canoe, just as another volley was fired.  The act was the means
of saving his life, for at least half-a-dozen bullets whizzed close over
his head.  Before he could recover himself a strong hand grasped his
neck and flung him backwards.  Probably a desperate hand-to-hand fight
would have ensued, for Fergus McKay had much of the bone, muscle, and
sinew, that is characteristic of his race, but a blow from an unseen
weapon stunned him, and when his senses returned he found himself bound
hand and foot lying in the bottom of a canoe.  He could tell from its
motion, that it was descending the river.

Meanwhile Dan Davidson, under the impression that his comrade was also
seeking safety in the bush, did his best to advance in circumstances of
which he had never yet had experience, for, if the night was dark on the
open bosom of the river, it presented the blackness of Erebus in the
forest.  Dan literally could not see an inch in advance of his own nose.
If he held up his hand before his face it was absolutely invisible.

In the haste of the first rush he had crashed through a mass of small
shrubbery with which the bank of the stream was lined.  Then on passing
through that he tumbled head over heels into a hollow, and narrowly
missed breaking his gun.  Beyond that he was arrested by a tree with
such violence that he fell and lay for a minute or two, half-stunned.
While lying thus, experience began to teach him, and common sense to
have fair-play.

"A little more of this," he thought, "and I'm a dead man.  Besides, if
it is difficult for me to traverse the forest in the dark, it is equally
difficult for the savages.  My plan is to feel my way step by step, with
caution.  Discussing with a group of pastors from the mountain men as
black and twisted branches, and covered with brown blazers and
leggings, girls with red handkerchiefs and skirts and filthy mended
that passed from generation to generation.

Had fallen from the mountains to see the Corpus of Toledo, and the ships
went by the cathedral with awe in his eyes, afraid of its own steps,
each time shaking rugía body, as if they fear being expelled from that
magical palace equal to those of the stories. Women with a finger
pointed windows of the colors, the rose windows of the covers, the
warriors of the clock of the golden door of the Fair, pipe organs, and
remained motionless, with his mouth open in stupid contemplation.

The kennel, with their red robes, they looked like a prince, and troubled
by respect, unable to understand his words. When threatened with a cane
_Tato_ a mastiff that hit the legs of their masters, the people simply
decided to leave the temple before leaving the faithful companion of his
life jungle. Gabriel looked at the gate of the choir. The high and low
chairs were occupied. Was a day of great celebration, not only the
canons and beneficiaries were in their seats, but the priests of the
chapel of the Kings and prebendades Mozarab of the chapel, the two
small churches that were living apart, with the traditional autonomy
within the Cathedral of Toledo.

Moon was in the middle of the choir at his friend's teacher chapel with
surplice fuzzy, moving a small baton. Around him were grouped up to a
dozen musicians and singers, whose voices were stifled sounds and each
time came from the top of the body.
The importance of checking the haemorrhage was so obvious, that he at
once sat down and did his best to bind up the wound with the red cotton
kerchief that encircled his neck.  Having accomplished this as well as
he could in the dark, he resumed his journey, and, after several hours
of laborious scrambling, at last came to a halt with a feeling of very
considerable, and to him unusual, exhaustion.

Again he sat down on what seemed to be a bed of moss, and began to
meditate.

"Impossible to go further!" he thought.  "I feel quite knocked up.
Strange!  I never felt like this before.  It must have been the tumbles
that did it, or it may be that I've lost more blood than I suppose.
I'll rest a bit now, and begin a search for Fergus by the first streak
of dawn."

In pursuance of this intention, the wearied man lay down, and putting
his head on a mossy pillow, fell into a profound sleep, which was not
broken till the sun was high in the heavens on the following day.

When at last he did awake, and attempted to sit up, Dan felt, to his
surprise and no small alarm, that he was as weak as a child, that his
leg lay in a pool of coagulated gore, and that blood was still slowly
trickling from the wound in his thigh.

Although disposed to lie down and give way to an almost irresistible
tendency to slumber, Dan was too well aware that death stared him in the
face to succumb to the feeling without a struggle.  He therefore made a
mighty effort of will; sat up; undid the soaking bandage, and proceeded
to extemporise a sort of tourniquet with it and a short piece of stick.

The contrivance, rude as it was, proved effectual, for it stopped the
bleeding, but Dan could not help feeling that he had already lost so
much blood that he was reduced almost to the last stage of exhaustion,
and that another hour or two would probably see the close of his earthly
career.  Nothing, perhaps, could have impressed this truth upon him so
forcibly as his inability to shout when he tried to do so.

In the faint hope that Fergus might be within call, he raised his voice
with the full knowledge that he ran the risk of attracting a foe instead
of a comrade.  The sound that complied with the impulse of his will
would have made him laugh if he had not felt an amazing and
unaccountable disposition to cry.  Up to that period of his life--almost
from his earliest babyhood--Dan Davidson's capacious chest had always
contained the machinery, and the power, to make the nursery or the
welkin ring with almost unparalleled violence.  Now, the chest, though
still capacious, and still full of the machinery, seemed to have totally
lost the power, for the intended shout came forth in a gasp and ended in
a sigh.

It was much the same when he essayed to rise.  His legs almost refused
to support him; everything appeared to swim before his eyes, and he sank
down again listlessly on the ground.  For the first time, perhaps, in
his life, the strong man had the conviction effectually carried home to
him that he was mortal, and could become helpless.  The advantage of
early training by a godly mother became apparent in this hour of
weakness, for his first impulse was to pray for help, and the resulting
effect--whether men choose to call it natural or supernatural--was at
least partial relief from anxiety, and that degree of comfort which
almost invariably arises from a state of resignation.

After a brief rest, the power of active thought revived a little, and
Dan, again raising himself on one elbow, tried to rouse himself to the
necessity of immediate action of some sort if his life was to be saved.

The spot on which he had lain, or rather fallen down, on the preceding
night happened to be the fringe of the forest where it bordered on an
extensive plain or stretch of prairie land.  It was surrounded by a
dense growth of trees and bushes, except on the side next the plain,
where an opening permitted of an extensive view over the undulating
country.  No better spot could have been chosen, even in broad daylight,
for an encampment, than had been thus fallen upon by the hunter in the
darkness of night.

But the poor man felt at once that this advantage could be of no avail
to him, for in the haste of landing he had thought only of his gun, and
had left his axe, with the bag containing materials for making fire, in
the canoe.  Fortunately he had not divested himself of his powder-horn
or shot-pouch, so he was not without the means of procuring food, but of
what use could these be, he reflected, if he had not strength to use
them?

Once again, in the energy of determination, he rose up and shouldered
his gun with the intention of making his way across the plain, in the
hope that he might at all events reach the wigwam of some wandering
Indian, but he trembled so from excessive weakness that he was obliged
to give up the attempt, and again sank down with feelings akin to
despair.

To add to his distress, hunger now assailed him so violently that he
would have roasted and eaten his moccasins--as many a starving man had
done before him, though without much benefit--but even this resource was
denied him for the want of fire, and raw moccasin was not only
indigestible but uneatable!

Still, as it seemed his only hope, he gathered a few dry twigs and
sticks together, drew the charge from his gun and sought to kindle some
mossy lichen into flame by flashing the priming in the pan of the lock.
Recent rains had damped everything, however, and his attempts proved
abortive.  Fortunately the weather was warm, so that he did not suffer
from cold.

While he was yet labouring assiduously to accomplish his purpose, the
whir of wings was heard overhead.  Glancing quickly up, he perceived
that a small flock of willow-grouse had settled on the bushes close to
him.  He was not surprised, though very thankful, for these birds were
numerous enough and he had heard them flying about from time to time,
but that they should settle down so near was exceedingly opportune and
unexpected.

With eager haste and caution he rammed home the charge he had so
recently withdrawn--keeping his eyes fixed longingly on the game all the
time.  That the birds saw him was obvious, for they kept turning their
heads from side to side and looking down at him with curiosity.  By good
fortune grouse of this kind are sometimes very stupid as well as tame.
They did not take alarm at Dan's motions, but craned their necks and
seemed to eye him with considerable curiosity.  Even when he tried to
take aim at them their general aspect suggested that they were asking,
mentally, "What next?"

But Dan found that he could not aim.  The point of the gun wavered
around as it might have done in the hands of a child.

With a short--almost contemptuous--laugh at his ridiculous incapacity,
Dan lowered the gun.

Stupid as they were, the laugh was too much for the birds.  They spread
their wings.

"Now or never!" exclaimed Dan aloud.  He pointed his gun straight at the
flock; took no aim, and fired!

The result was that a plump specimen dropped almost at his feet.  If he
had been able to cheer he would have done so.  But he was not, so he
thanked God, fervently, instead.

Again the poor man essayed to kindle a fire, but in trying to do this
with gunpowder he made the startling discovery that he had only one more
charge in his powder-horn.  He therefore re-loaded his gun, wiped out
the pan and primed with care, feeling that this might be the last thing
that would stand between him and starvation.  It might have stood
between him and something worse--but of that, more hereafter.

Starving men are not particular.  That day Dan did what he would have
believed to have been, in him, an impossibility--he drank the blood of
the bird and ate its flesh raw!

"After all," thought he, while engaged in this half-cannibalistic deed,
"what's the difference between raw grouse and raw oyster?"

It is but right to add that he did not philosophise much on the subject.
Having consumed his meal, he lay down beside his gun and slept the
sleep of the weary.


CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.

A DESPERATE SITUATION.

Awaking next morning much refreshed, but with a keen appetite for more
grouse, Dan Davidson sat up and reflected.  He felt that, although
refreshed, the great weakness resulting from excessive loss of blood
still rendered him almost helpless, and he knew that making new blood
was a process that required good feeding and considerable time.  What,
then, was to be done?

He had scarcely asked himself the question when a rustle in the bushes
near him caused him to look quickly round and seize his gun.  But the
noise was not repeated, and nothing could be seen to justify alarm.
Still Dan felt that the sound justified caution; he therefore kept his
gun handy, and loosened in its sheath the scalping-knife which he always
carried in his belt--for eating purposes, not for scalping.

Thus he sat for nearly an hour with an uncomfortable sensation that
danger of some sort lurked near him, until he almost fell asleep.  Then,
rousing himself he proceeded to breakfast on the bones and scraps of the
previous night's supper.

While thus engaged he tried to make up his mind what course he ought to
pursue--whether to remain where he was until his friends should have
time to find him--for he felt sure that Okematan would escape and reach
the Settlement, in which case a search for him would certainly be set on
foot--or whether he should make a desperate effort to stagger on, and
ultimately, if need be, creep towards home.  The pain of his wound was
now so great as to render the latter course almost impossible.  He
therefore resolved to wait and give his friends time to institute a
search, trusting to another shot at willow-grouse for a supply of food.

He had scarcely made up his mind to this plan when the rustling in the
bushes was repeated again.  Seizing his gun, which he had laid down, Dan
faced round just in time to see the hindquarters and tail of a large
grey wolf disappearing in the bushes.

To say that he felt considerable alarm when he saw this is not to stamp
him with undue timidity, for he would have rejoiced to have had the wolf
in his clutches, then and there, and to engage in single combat with it,
weak though he was.  What troubled him was his knowledge of the fact
that the mean spirited and sly brute was noted for its apparent sagacity
in finding out when an intended victim was growing too feeble to show
fight--either from wounds or old age--and its pertinacity and patience
in biding the time when an attack could be made with safety.

Had this horrible creature discerned, by some occult knowledge, that the
sands in his glass were running low?  Was it to be his fate to face his
glaring murderer until he had not vital power left to grapple with it,
or to guard his throat from its hideous fangs?  These were questions
which forced themselves upon him, and which might well have caused the
stoutest heart to shrink from the threatened and terrible doom.

In the strength of his emotion he had almost fired at a venture at the
spot where the brute had disappeared; but luckily the remembrance that
it was his last charge of ammunition came to him in time, and he had the
resolution to restrain himself even when his finger was on the trigger.

Dan now perceived that he must not venture to remain on the spot where
he had passed the night, because, being surrounded on three sides by
shrubbery, it afforded his grisly foe an opportunity to approach from
any quarter, and spring on him the moment he should find him off his
guard.

There was a natural bank of earth out on the plain about three or four
hundred yards off, with neither trees nor bushes near it.  The bank was
not more than four feet high, and the top slightly overhung its base, so
that it afforded some slight protection from the sun.  To this spot Dan
resolved to betake himself, and immediately began the journey--for a
journey it surely was, seeing that the hunter had to do it on hands and
knees, lifting his gun and pushing it before him, each yard or so, as he
went along.  The inflammation of his wound rendered the process all the
slower and more painful, and a burning thirst, which he had no means of
slaking, added to his misery.

By the time he had passed over the short distance, he was so much
exhausted that he fell at the foot of the bank almost in a swoon.

Evidently the wolf imagined that its time had now come, for it sneaked
out of the wood when the hunter fell, and began cautiously to advance.
But Dan saw this, and, making a desperate effort, arose to a sitting
posture, leaned his back against the bank, and placed his gun across his
knees.

Seeing this, the wolf sat down on its haunches, and coolly began to bide
its time.

"Ha! you brute!" muttered Dan, "I could easily stop your mischief if my
strength wasn't all gone.  As it is, I dare not give you my last shot
till you are so close that you can look down the barrel o' my gun."

From this point a watch of endurance began on both sides--the brute, of
course, unaware of the deadly weapon which its intended victim held, and
the man fully aware of the fact that if he should venture to lie down
and sleep, his doom would be sealed.

It is impossible for any one who has not had trial of similar
experiences to imagine the rush of thought and feeling that passed
through the brain and breast of Dan Davidson during the long dreary
hours of that terrible day.  Sometimes he fell into a half-dreamy
condition, in which his mind leaped over forests and ocean to bonnie
Scotland, where his days of childhood were spent in glorious revelry on
her sunny banks and braes.  At other times the memory of school-days
came strong upon him, when play and lessons, and palmies were all the
cares he had; or thoughts of Sabbaths spent with his mother--now in the
church, now in the fields, or at the cottage door learning Bible stories
and hearing words of wisdom and the story of the crucified One from her
lips.  Then the scene would change, and he was crossing the stormy
ocean, or fighting with Red-skins, or thundering after the buffalo on
the wide prairies.  But through all the varied fabric of his thoughts
there ran two distinct threads, one golden, the other black.  The first
we need hardly say was Elspie McKay; the second was that awful wolf
which sat there glaring at him with a hang-dog expression, with the red
tongue hanging out of its mouth, and from which he never for a moment
allowed his eyes to wander.

As evening began to draw on, the situation became terrible, for Dan felt
that the little strength he had left was fast sinking.  The efforts by
which he had succeeded in rousing himself in the earlier parts of the
day were failing of their effect.  Then a strange and sudden change
occurred, for, while he knew that the end of the trial was rapidly
approaching, he began to experience a feeling of indifference--the
result, no doubt, of excessive weariness--and almost a wish that all was
over.  Nevertheless, whenever that wolf moved, or changed its position
ever so little, the instinct of self-preservation returned in full
force, and Dan, pulling himself together, prepared to defend himself
desperately to the last gasp.

While the two were thus glaring at each other, Dan was startled and
thoroughly aroused from his irresistible lethargy by a loud report.

Next moment he saw the wolf extended dead upon the plain.


CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.

ADVENTURES OF FERGUS AND HIS FRIENDS.

In order to account for the sudden death recorded in the last chapter,
we must turn aside to follow for a little the fortunes of Fergus McKay.

It will be remembered that the vigorous Highlander, after overturning
the Indian canoe and running his own canoe on shore, was seized by the
neck, while in the act of reaching forward to grasp his gun, and
captured.

Now, Fergus was of an unusually knowing and wily nature.  He possessed
what some would call more than his share of readiness in action and
sagacity in counsel, though his ordinary reticence and sluggishness of
manner concealed those qualities to some extent.

Being endued, also, with more than the average allowance of that bodily
strength for which his countrymen are famous, his first impulse was to
exert his powers and show fight, but he had been taken suddenly at a
disadvantage and thrown on his back into the bottom of the canoe, and at
least three pair of very muscular hands grasped his throat and other
parts of his person.  That they were strong hands he felt; that they
belonged to big strong savages he had every reason to believe--though it
was too dark to see--and that scalping-knives and tomahawks were handy
to them he knew to be highly probable.  He therefore promptly made up
his mind as to his course of action, and at once began to play his part.
Making a very feeble resistance--just enough, in short, to deceive--he
begged for mercy in soft, rather tremulous and very abject tones.  True,
his language was English--at least that sort of English to which the
mountaineers of Scotland are addicted--but he trusted to the tone and
manner of his speech, not to the sense, which Saulteaux, he knew, could
not be expected to understand.

"Oh! then, don't be hard on me.  Don't kill me, goot shentlemen," he
whined.  "It iss a poor worthless thing I am--whatever!"

These remarks, and a few similar appeals for mercy, were accompanied
with many dismal groans, as his captors were dragging him up the bank of
the stream.  Pausing for a moment, one of them produced a cord, with
which they proceeded to bind their cowardly and unresisting prisoner.

Whether the Indians were deceived by their victim's tones and manner,
and the soft condition of his carefully relaxed muscles, we cannot tell,
but it seemed as if such were the case, for some of the brief remarks
made by his captors had in them a smack of undisguised contempt, and
when the cord was being put round his arms he felt that the grip of his
captors was slightly relaxed.

Now or never was his chance!  Hurling the men on either side of him
right and left, he delivered two random blows in front, one of which
happily took effect on a savage chest, the other on a savage nose, and
cleared the way in that direction.  With a bound like that of one of his
own mountain deer, he cleared the bank, and plunged into the river.

In ordinary circumstances an attempt of this kind would have been worse
than useless, for the Indians would not only have jumped into their
canoes and overtaken the fugitive, but some of them would have run down
the bank of the stream to prevent a landing.  Some such attempt was
indeed made on the present occasion, but the intense darkness was in
favour of Fergus, and the searching canoes only ran into each other,
while the searchers on land were still more at a disadvantage.

Now, Fergus McKay was as much at home in water as an otter or a
musk-rat.  Indeed he had been known among his playmates in the old
country as the "Water-rat."  When, therefore, he plunged into the river,
as described, he took care to hold his breath as if for a long dive, and
drifted with the current a considerable distance as motionless as a dead
man.  The Indians listened intently, of course; for his coming to the
surface; for the breathing, and, it might be, for the splashing that
would be natural after such a leap, but no breathing or splashing met
their ears, for when Fergus put up his head, far down the stream, he
only let out his nose and mouth for a gentle inspiration, and sank
again.

"It iss circumventin' you at your own trade, fightin' you wi' your own
claymore, that I will be doin'," he thought, as he rose a second time,
and swam softly with the stream.

Fergus had the advantage of being well acquainted with the river in
which he was swimming, as well as with the lands in its neighbourhood,
and he knew that there was a certain bend in the stream which it would
take the canoe of Okematan a considerable time to traverse.  By cutting
across a narrow neck of land there was, therefore, a possibility of his
intercepting the canoe.

The Saulteaux, of course, might have also taken advantage of this
circumstance, but they could have done so only on foot, and they knew
that without canoes they could not arrest the progress of the fugitives.

Reaching the spot where he wished to land, by intuition almost, the
Highlander soon found himself on the bank, squeezed the water out of his
garments, and set off as quickly as he dared in such darkness.  By good
fortune he happened to cross a hunter's track or path--like a
sheep-run--with which he was familiar, and, by following it, was able to
advance much more rapidly.  In a short time he again came out on the
left bank of the river.  There he sat down on a boulder to listen.
Profound was his attention to every sound--as profound, almost, as his
anxiety, for he knew that if the canoe should have already passed he
would be obliged to make his way back to the Settlement on foot by a
straight course, which meant a slow, toilsome march, scrambling through
pathless woods, wading morasses, and swimming across rivers.

He had been seated thus for about half-an-hour, and in his impatience
was giving way to despondency, when the plash of water smote upon his
ear.  Cocking the said ear attentively, he was rewarded with another
smite, and, in a few minutes, distinctly heard the sound of paddles.

He put his hands to his mouth forthwith, and uttered a peculiar cry.

Instantly the sound of the paddles ceased as Archie Sinclair, looking
over his shoulder, said--

"Did you hear that, Oke?"

Before Oke could reply, the cry was repeated.

"It is Fer-gus," said the Indian, answering to the cry, and steering in
the direction whence it came.  "Are you sure, Oke?"

"Okematan never speaks till he is sure--waugh!"

"H'm!  I'm not so sure o' _that_," muttered the boy to himself.

A few seconds put the matter at rest, for the voice of the Highlander
was heard, as they cautiously drew near, saying--

"Iss it _you_?"

"I think it is!" replied Archie; "why, man, where are you?  I can see
nothing."

"Wow! man, but I am gled," said Fergus; "just follow your nose, Archie,
an' you'll be all right."

Another moment, and the canoe was checked by Fergus, who had stepped
into the water to prevent its being injured against the stones.

"You better gie me the paddle, Archie, an' sit beside Little Bill.  It
iss tired o' paddlin' you will be by now."

"But where is Dan?" asked Archie as he complied with this request.

"That iss more than I can tell you, boy, but he's safe enough I doubt
not, for I heard him gie a cheer as he jamp into the wuds, an' it's
beyont the power o' a mortal Red-skin to chase an active man on a night
like this."

My orders are met with reluctance, and when I want to impose, until the
last priest leaves with what he calls his rights, and makes me fight and
go to the Rota and Rome if necessary. Let's see: I am not the
master or what am I? Will you discuss with the pastor and his flock to
guide consultation on the right track ...? Marean and stun me with their
issues and lawsuits. There is between them and half men, gossip, and
they are all cowards.

In my view have a low presence, smile and praise to His Eminence, and
just back away, they are snakes who try to bite, scorpion languages
that respect nothing ...

Oh, Tomasa! ¡Hija mía! ¡Tenme pity! Cree that when I think about this
I get very sick. Palidecía And the prelate, resigning his seat to gesture
painful, as if his bowels were moved with intense pangs. - If you do
not - said the gardener -. You are above all, you win. - Of course
I shall overcome, well it does not need more! It would be the
first time below. Wives of these tricks annoy me somewhat. I know that I
shall see the end of my feet nasty enemies.

But their languages, Tomasa! What they say about people I love most in
the world! This is what hurts me, what killed me. He returned to sit
at about the center-left voice to speak on: - You know my past better
than anyone, and you inspire me because I have great confidence.

In addition, you are listed, and do not know what you guess. Visitation
know what it is for me, and certainly not ignore what they say
about her miserable.

Do not make the dumb: you know, everyone in the cathedral and even
beyond to know and believe these slanders.

You're the only one who can not believe, because you know the truth
... But alas, I can not tell the truth, I cried out I prevent these
habits. And grabbed a handful of his cassock with fingers tense, as if
to tear. It took a long time of silence.

Don Sebastian eyes watched the ground hard, getting their hands
as if to grab the invisible enemy. Occasionally felt the pangs
of his illness and sighs painfully. - Why think about such things -
said the gardener -. It gets you bad, and it did not need to bother going
down to see me.

Would have done better staying in the palace. - No, you distract me, I
find some solace communicating sentences. Up there, I just despair,
having to make efforts to swallow the rage. I do not want to know my
relatives, because they would be able to laugh, not that I know
nothing ... my poor Visitation And I do not know disguise!

, I can not feign joy when I'm angry ... What the hell I suffer!
Not to say that I was a man, I've been weak, as I am made of flesh, and
I carry with me the fruits of my absence, without wanting to leave while
they pursue slander me!

Each piece, like someone who is, and I want to be good in the midst
of my sins. Could have separated from my children, have been abandoned,
as do others keep their reputation of saints, but I am a man, I
am proud of this: a man with his faults and his virtues, not one
more or one less than the generality of the humans.

The feeling of parenthood is so ingrained in me, so deep, that
before leaving Miter lose my children.

I remember how I died when Juanito's father, who passed by my nephew.
I thought dying.

A hombrón so beautiful and with a future so bright! I had made judge,
Chief Minister, what do I know!

And in twenty-four hours I was dying, as if the heavens wanted to
punish. It is true that I have my grandson, but nothing that Juanito
resembles his father, and I confess: I bit you do not see it far
more than a reflection of my poor son.

From my past, from the time it was the happiest of my life, I can only
Visitation. It is the portrait of the poor dead;! Love! And this I mean
that the mob that gentuza with slander ... We have to kill them! Dominated
by the happy memories of the spring that had flourished in the early years
of bishop in a diocese outside of Andalusia, to Tomasa repeated once more,
its relations with some lady devotee since childhood that I felt the
horror world.

Devotion had together, but life did not take long to regain their privileges,
breaking through almost mystical in their relationships and attaching
them in carnal embrace. Had lived faithful to one another in the mystery
of ecclesial life, amándose with scrupulous caution, but the secret
of their relationship beyond the public until she died, leaving two
children.

Don Sebastian, a man of strong passions, I felt strongly to parenthood.
Those two people were the poor image of the dead, the memory of
the romance of a single life dedicated to the ambition.

The slander that drove the enemy, relying on the presence of his
daughter in the archbishop's palace, we were crazy. - The believe
my dear!

- Read with accent angry -. My poor Visitation, so good, so affectionate,
so for all Mansito, into any one of these miserable!

A lover I've taken my fun for the College of noble maidens ...

As if I, old and sick to think these were crap!

¡¡...!, Indecent miserable ...! At least many crimes are committed ... -
Let them say, God is high and we see them all. - I know, but this
is not enough to calm down.

You have children, Tomasa, and know what love is.

It not only hurts us what is done against them, but what is said ...
What took days of suffering! Small you know that my dream was to
what I am. I looked at the throne of the choir and thought of how
good they would be there, in the overwhelming joy of being prince of
the Church.

Well, I'm already on the throne. He walked half a century away the stones,
leaving the skin and flesh until the brambles of the slope. I
know how I could get out of the pile and get to black bishop! After
... I'll be archbishop am!, I'll be'm cardinal!, I'll be unable to get
more! So what? Happiness always march ahead of us, as the cloud of light
that guided the Israelites.

We see, almost touch, but not be caught. I am more unhappy now that at
the time was struggling to be something that I thought the most unfortunate
of men. I have no youth at the height that I fixed all eyes on me, I
can not stand. Oh, Tomasa! Compadéceme, I am worthy of pity.

Being a parent, and having to hide a crime! We want my daughter to a love
that is growing more and more as they approached death, and having to
suffer that people take this love so pure for something disgusting
...

And the terrible sight of Don Sebastian, and that scares throughout the
diocese, cloud with tears. - I also have other sentences - continued -
but these are farsighted man who fears the future.

When you die, all I have is for my daughter. Giovannino account with
his mother, who was rich, and has a career and support my friends.
Visitation will be powerful. You know, I throw in my opponents face what
they call my greed. Greedy, no: farsighted, lover of the welfare of
the mine. I saved a lot, I am not of those who share bread at the door
of his palace, nor seek celebrity for charity. I pastures in Extremadura,
many vineyards in La Mancha, houses and especially the role of the
state, a lot of paper.

As a good Spanish, I want to help the government with my money,
especially as it produces profits.

I do not know certainly that I have: will be twenty million real, perhaps
more. Any savings for me, with increased business.

I can not complain about the luck, the Lord has helped me. And all for
my poor Visitation! My joy is to see her married to a good man, but she
does not want to separate from me. He attracts the church, and this
is my fear. Not surprised, Tomasa, I, Prince of the Church, to see how
they tremble delivery to the devotion and respect I can only divert
it.

I like women religious, the devout not only is good in the church. The
woman must live, must enjoy and be a mother.

I've always looked bad to the nuns. - Leave it, sir - "said the gardener
-. This is not surprising that you like the church. The way you live,
you can not have other hobbies. - For today, I fear nothing. I'm on
your side, and no matter what I like dealing with Monjitas. But
I can die tomorrow and you do great figúrate poor bite will visit with
their millions, alone and with this love of religious life, others
can exploit more ready ...!

I've seen a lot, I'm in class and I'm in the secret. There is no shortage
religious orders engaged in hunting estates, for the greater glory
of God, they say.

Moreover, these nuns walking around foreign large chips, which are
bobcats for this kind of work. I am terrified to think that fall on my
daughter. I am a former Catholic, one of religiosity Spanish net: a
Castilian Catholicism, as they say in panllevar, clean modern
Aliens.

It would be sad to have spent their lives saving the Jesuits to gain
weight or those sisters who do not speak in Castilian. I do not want my
money to suffer the same fate as the clerk of the maxim. Therefore,
the troubles of my fight with the enemy joins gentuza pain that
causes me the weak character of my daughter.

Perhaps the hunt, and some laugh at me Tuno seizing my money. And excited
by its black thoughts, unleashed an expletive and pure obscene,
memories of his days as a soldier.

In the presence of the gardener, did not contain. The old woman was
accustomed to the relief of his character. - Let's see - he said absolutely,
after a long silence -. You who know me better than anyone else: I'm as
bad as the enemies pose? Deserve that the Lord will punish me for
my faults?

Thou art a soul in God, simple and good, and know more about it with
your instinct that all doctors of theology. - Did you wrong, don
Sebastián? Jesus ...! You are a man like the others, neither more nor
less.

Perhaps better than most, because it is simple, all in one piece, without
deception or hypocrisy. - A man: You said it. I am a man like any other.
Those who arrive at some point we are like the saints who are on
the facades of churches.

Below, causing admiration for her beauty; Watched closely, horror
produced by the ugliness of the stone by Roide time.

Even if we try to sanctify, putting distance, we are not only men,
beings of flesh for those who lean surround.

In the Church are those who fought contadísimos of human passions.

And who knows, even those privileged few are not bitten by the
demon of vanity, and the extreme asceticism of his life, think of the
glory of being in altars ... The priest managed to dominate the meat
falls into greed, which is the ecclesiastic service par excellence. I've
never treasured by service, I saved for my own, never for me.

Prelate while the long street, but in their irresistible desire to confess
to the simple woman, continued: - I am sure that God does not
despise me when I get my hours. His infinite mercy is above all the
little things in life. What is my crime? Have loved a woman, as my
father loved my mother to have children, as were the apostles and
saints.

So what? Ecclesiastical celibacy is an invention of men, a breakdown
of discipline in the councils agreed, but the meat and their requirements
are in many previous centuries dating back to Paradise. Whoever jumps
the barrier, not vice, but by irresistible passion, because it can not
overcome the impulse to create a family and have a companion, that will
undoubtedly lack the laws of the Church, but not to disobey God
Approaching .... death, I fear.

I doubt many nights and tremble like a child .... I have served my God.
At other times he would have defended with the sword, heretics
fighting, now I am his priest, and battle for him every time I see
the wickedness of the times off some of its glory. The Lord forgive me,
received in their midst. You who are so good, Tomasa, and you have
at your soul angel bark rough, do not you think so ...

The gardener smiled, and his words pierced the silence slowly dying in
the afternoon. - Calm, Don Sebastian .

I have seen many saints in this house, and worth less than you. To ensure
their salvation had abandoned the children.

To maintain what they call purity of the soul of the family would have
disowned. Believe me you to me: come here not holy men, all men. We
should not regret having followed the impulse of the heart.

God made us in His image and likeness, and we just put the feeling of
the family. Moreover, chastity, celibacy and other zarandajas, was
invented to distinguish you from the common people.

Whether you are a man, Don Sebastian, the more it would be more good and
better accommodate the Lord in his glory.

IX few days after the Corpus Antolín was a morning gift for Gabriel.
The _Vara of plata_ Luna smiled, talking to air protector.

He thought about it all night. He hurt him down, walking in the
cloister. The lack of occupation was what inspired him those ideas so
perverse. - Let's see - he added -: Can you download it with me
every evening to the cathedral to show the Treasury and the other
prices?

Many foreigners who come just to understand if left when I asked.

You know your language, know the French, the English language and I do
not know how many more, as your brother says.

The cathedral can gain a great deal to prove to those foreigners who have
an interpreter available, you do us a favor and do not lose anything.

It is always an entertainment to see new faces. As a reward gift ....
She stopped here Antolín, scratching his head under the bonnet.

He would scrape some of the funds of the Obrería if it was not possible
for the first time, being thin and drained income premium, and is
provide below.

And waited with eager gaze the response to Gabriel.

This mostróse line. At the end was a guest of the cathedral, and
something should. And from that evening went down to the temple in
the chorus to teach foreign wealth of the church.

Never miss travelers, exhibiting the papelillos color gift Antolín,
awaited the moment to admire the jewelry. The _Vara of plata_ did not see
a foreigner who does not think he was a lord or a duke, strange often
gawky in his dress.

For him only the great ones of the earth could afford the pleasure of
traveling, and opened some eyes in disbelief and shocked when
Gabriel said that many of those people were shoemakers shop in
London or Paris were in the holiday gift of an excursion by the
former country of the Moors. advanced ships with five canons

They were the guardians of the Treasury.

Opened each lock entrusted to his custody, heavily rotated left open the
door and the chapel with its ancient treasures.

Huge windows, like a museum, is displaying the opulence of the old
cathedral images of solid silver, topped by huge balloons funny
figurines, all of precious metal, ivory arches work and complicated,
and virile monstrances golden enormous dishes gold and embossed
with mythological scenes that revived the joy of paganism in that
dingy, dusty corner of the Christian church. gemstone extended its
range of colors pectorals miter and robes of the Virgin.

Diamonds were so huge that they doubt their authenticity, pebble-sized
emeralds, amethysts, topaz and pearls, many pearls, hundreds,
thousands, such as hail falls on the garment of the Virgin, Outsiders
admirábanse before this opulence, dazzled by its enormity, and
Gabriel used to visit the day, everything looked coldly.

The Treasury had an unfortunate air of dilapidation. Wealth had with the
old cathedral. The diamonds do not shine, the gold appeared tarnished
and dusty, silver ennegrecía, the pearls and opaque were killed.

Smoke from the candles and the rancid atmosphere of the temple had skated
around sadly. "The Church - said Gabriel - As aging plays. Wealth lose
brightness in their hands, as jewels that fall into the hands of usurers.
The diamond is blurred within the large stingy, the most beautiful
blackens their altars.

"After the visit to the exhibition came from the Treasury Ochavo, the
octagonal chapel of dark marble: pantheon where the relics of human
waste disgusting, horrible laughter of the skull, arm and vertebrae
mummified cavities shown in silver and gold cups.

Mercy of other centuries, and credulous vulgar, appeared so absurd to
display in the century of unbelief, the same gift Antolín so
intransigent about the glories of its cathedral, lowered voice and
poised to bring the piece of mantle Santa Leocadia when "appeared"
to the Archbishop of Toledo, realizing how difficult it was to
explain what material is wearing the apparitions. faithfully
translated Gabriel's explanation _Vara of plata_, often with ironic
stress severity, while escorting the canons caravan of strangers
alejábanse distracted air with some steps to avoid questions.

A phlegmatic English interpreter interrupted a day at: - And you have
no feathers on the wings of San Miguel - No, sir, and shame -
answered Luna equally seriously -.

But we will find you in another cathedral. Here we can not have everything.
The Chapter House, a mixture of Gothic and Arabic architecture, visitors
admired the archbishops of Toledo double row on the wall painted with
gold miter and crosier. Gabriel drew attention to Cerebruno gift, the
medieval prelate, named for its huge head.

But the coat was what resulted in the greatest surprise outsiders. It was
a great piece with shelves and cupboards of old wood.

Above them, the walls were covered with large paintings and powdered
broken copies of Flemish painting that had been relegated to the
council that corner.

Having thus
fulfilled duty and relieved conscience, he exchanged the finger for the
pipe-stem, and began to smoke.  The spoiled, as well as despoiled, child
uttered a howl of indignation, and staggered off to its mother; but she
received it with a smile of affectionate indifference, whereupon the
injured creature went back to the tent, howling, and, apparently, howled
itself to sleep.

Again La Certe broke the piscatorial spell that had settled down on
them, and, taking up the thread of discourse where he had dropped it,
repeated his statement that he had been wondering for a long time why
Cloudbrow, _alias_ young Duncan McKay, was so sharp and fierce in
denying that he knew anything about the murder of Henri Perrin.

"Hee! hee!" was Slowfoot's significant reply.

"Can Slowfoot not guess?" he asked, after attending to a hopeful nibble,
which came to nothing.

"Slowfoot need not guess; she _knows_," said the woman with an air of
great mystery.

"What does Slowfoot know?"

The woman's answer to this was a look of exceeding slyness.  But this
did not content her lord, who, after repeated questions, and a threat to
resort to extreme measures in case of continued refusal, drew from her a
distinct answer.

"Slowfoot knows that Cloudbrow _killed_ Perrin."

"Sh!" exclaimed La Certe, with a look of real concern, "I am not yet
tired of you, Slowfoot; and if old McKay hears you say that he will
shoot you."

"Slowfoot is not a fool," retorted the woman: "the old man will never
hear her say that.  What has Slowfoot got to do with it?  She can hold
her tongue!"

"She can do that, for certain," returned her husband with good-natured
sarcasm.  "In that, as in many things, she excels other women.  I would
never have married her had it not been so.  But how do you come to be so
sure?"

"I know the knife," returned the woman, becoming more literal as she
went on, "and Marie Blanc knows it.  Her husband once got the loan of it
from Cloudbrow, and she looked at it with care, because she had never
seen such a knife before.  She knew all its marks.  Why does Cloudbrow
deny that it is his?  Because it was Cloudbrow who killed Perrin.  If it
had been anybody else he would have known it, and he would have said
so--for he was _there_."

"How know you that he was there?"

"Marie Blanc knows.  She netted the snowshoes that Cloudbrow wore, and
she saw the footprints."

"But pairs of snowshoes are very like each other," objected La Certe.

"Very like.  Yes; but did ever two shoes have the same mends in the same
places of the netting, where it had been broken, and the same marks on
the frames?"

"Never.  It will go hard with Cloudbrow if this is true."

"It will go hard with him whether it is true or not," returned the
woman; "for some of the friends of Perrin believe it to be true, and
swear--"

The disappearance of Slowfoot's float at this moment stopped her
swearing, and brought the conversation to an abrupt end.  The landing of
another goldeye prevented its resumption.

Having caught more than enough for a good supper, this easy-going pair
leaned their rods against a tree, and ascended the bank towards their
tent, which was an ordinary conical Indian wigwam, composed partly of
leather and partly of birch-bark, with a curtain for a door and a hole
in the top for a window; it also served for a chimney.

On the way they encountered one of the poor Swiss immigrants, who,
having a wife and family, and having been unsuccessful in
buffalo-hunting, and indeed in all other hunting, was in a state which
bordered on starvation.

"You have been lucky," said the Switzer, eyeing La Certe's fish
greedily.

"Sometimes luck comes to us--not often," answered the half-breed.  "Have
you caught any?"

"Yes, two small ones.  Here they are.  But what are these among three
children and a wife?  I know not how to fish," said the mountaineer
disconsolately.

The fact was not surprising, for the poor man was a watchmaker by trade,
and had never handled rod or gun till he was, as it were, cast adrift in
Rupert's Land.

"I will sell you some of my fish," said La Certe, who on all occasions
had a keen eye for a bargain.

"Good!  I am ready to buy," said the poor fellow, "but I have not much
to spend.  Only last week I gave my silver watch for eight gallons of
wheat.  I meant it for seed, but my wife and children were starving, so
we were have no seed and only five shillings to spare."

"Well, my friend," said La Certe, "fish is very scarce just now, but you
may have five goldeyes for your five shillings."

"O! that is too much," remonstrated the Switzer.

"No, no," interrupted the half-breed, amiably, "by no means--but if you
really think it too much fish for the money I will give you four
goldeyes!"

"Come, you know I don't mean that," returned the other, with a cynical
smile.  "Make it six, and I will agree.  And here is a pinch of snuff in
to the bargain."

He pulled out a box as he spoke, and opened it.

"Ha!" said La Certe, helping himself.  "I love snuff, and so does my
wife.  Do you not?"

Slowfoot answered, "Hee! hee!" and helped herself to as much as a good
broad finger and thumb could grasp, after which she sneezed with
violence.

"Now, behold! my friend--a-wheesht!" said La Certe, sneezing a bass
accompaniment to Slowfoot's treble.  "I will give you a catfish--a whole
catfish for--a-wheesht!--for that box and snuff."

The Switzer shook his head.

"Nay," he said.  "The snuff you may have, but the box was the gift of a
friend, and I am loath to part with it.  Besides, the box is of little
real value."

"You may have the head of the catfish for the snuff, and the whole
catfish for the box," said La Certe, with the firmness of a man who has
irrevocably made up his mind--for there are none so firm of purpose as
the weak and vacillating when they know they have got the whip-hand of
any one!  "And, behold!  I will be liberal," he added.  "You shall have
another goldeye into the bargain--six goldeyes for the five shillings
and a whole catfish for the box and snuff--voila!"  The poor Switzer
still hesitated.

"It is a great deal to give for so little," he said.

"That may be true," said the other, "but I would not see my family
starve for the satisfaction of carrying a snuff-box and five shillings
in my pocket."

This politic reference to the starving family decided the matter; the
poor Switzer emptied his pockets with a sigh, received the fish, and
went on his way, leaving La Certe and Slowfoot to return to their wigwam
highly pleased with their bargain.  As must have been noted by the
reader long ere now, this like-minded couple did not possess a
conscience between them--at least, if they did, it must at that time
have been a singularly shrunken and mummified one, which they had
managed to keep hidden away in some dark and exceedingly un-get-at-able
chamber of the soul.

Commercially speaking, however, they had some ground for satisfaction;
for at that time the ordinary price of a catfish, which is a little
larger than a haddock, was threepence.

Awakening the juvenile La Certe to the blissful realisation that a good
"square" meal was pending, Slowfoot ordered it to fill and light the
pipe for the father, while she set about preparing the fish for supper.


CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.

VISIT FROM SIOUX BROUGHT TO A DISASTROUS CLOSE.

Happening to hear of the bargain which we have just described, and being
under the impression that it might be good for La Certe's spirit to
receive a mild reproof, Mr Sutherland paid him a visit.

The Scotch Elder was, for a long time, the only man fitted to perform
the duties of a minister to his countrymen in that out-of-the-world
colony, and, being a true man of God, he could not hear of gross
injustice, or heartless conduct, without some slight attempt to open the
other's eyes to his sin.

It may well be understood that, in the nature of things and the state of
the country, the solitary Elder's duties were by no means light or
agreeable.  Indeed he would have had no heart to cope with them and with
the difficulties they entailed, had he not remembered that the battle
was not his, but the Lord's, and that he was only an instrument in the
all-powerful hand of the Spirit of God.  His own weapons were the Word,
Prayer, and the name of Jesus.

But it was not given to him to see much fruit of his visit to La Certe
at that time.  The half-breed, besides asserting himself to be a
"Catholic," (by which he meant a Roman Catholic), and, therefore, in no
way amenable to Sutherland's jurisdiction, received his remonstrances
with philosophical arguments tending to prove that men were meant to
make the best of circumstances as they found them, without any regard to
principles--which, after all, were not very seriously held or practised
by any one, he thought--especially in Red River.

As for Slowfoot, she listened with evident interest and curiosity to the
strange teaching and exhortations of the Elder, but when appealed to for
some sort of opinion on the various points touched, she replied with an
imbecile "Hee! hee!" which was not encouraging.

However, the good man had sown the seed faithfully and kindly.  The
watering thereof and the sprouting were, he knew, in the hands of the
Master.

Rising to take leave, the Elder put his hand in his pocket and pulled
out a large clasp-knife.

"Why, that's my knife that I lost!" exclaimed La Certe in surprise;
"where did you find it?"

"I found it on my table at home, where you left it that time you came to
ask for some tobacco.  Now, observe, if I did not seriously hold and
practise the principle of honesty, I would have made the best of
circumstances as I found them, and would have put the knife in my pocket
instead of returning it to you."

La Certe laughed, and Slowfoot said, "Hee! hee!" while the juvenile La
Certe availed itself of the opportunity to draw the pipe gently from its
father's hand and have a whiff.

"I have a message to you from the Governor," continued the Elder, taking
a piece of paper out of his pocket.

"For me!" exclaimed La Certe, in surprise.

"Yes.  He heard that you are hard up just now, and that you are going up
the river a considerable distance to hunt--is not that so?"

"Yes, that is true.  We start off to-morrow."

"Well, then, he gave me this order for some supplies of powder and shot,
twine and hooks, with some cloth, beads, and such like for Slowfoot."

"That is very good of the Governor--very considerate," said La Certe
with a pleased look.

"Very good," said Sutherland.  "Now, La Certe, suppose it true that men
are meant to make the best of circumstances as they find them, and that
I was a man without any regard to principle, I might have drawn these
supplies from the store for you, and used them myself, and you would not
have been a bit the wiser."

Again the half-breed laughed, and admitted the truth of the proposition,
while Slowfoot expressed her belief, (whatever it was), in a more than
usually emphatic "Hee! hee!"

Returning home from his apparently useless errand, Sutherland met Fred
Jenkins with a gun on his shoulder.  The seaman was accompanied by
Archie Sinclair.

"Well, Jenkins," he said, heartily, "you must be like a fish out o'
water in these regions.  Don't you feel a longing, sometimes, for the
roar of the gale and the smell o' the salt sea?"

"Can't say as I does, Mr Sutherland.  I've bin used to accommodate
myself to circumstances, dee see, ever since I was a small shaver; so
nothin' comes exactly amiss to me--"

"O Fred! how can you tell thumpers like that?" interrupted the forward
Archie.  "Isn't Elise Morel a miss to you? and Elspie, and Jessie
Davidson?"

"Clap a stopper on your mug, you young scape grace!" retorted the
seaman, who had some doubt as to whether the boy's putting Elise Morel's
name first was intentional or an accident.  "As I was a-going to say,
sir, I was always fond o' changes, an' the rollin' plains come to me as
pleasant, though not quite so familiar, as the rollin' sea."

"That's a satisfactory state o' mind, anyhow," returned the Elder.  "But
where away now?--to cater for the pot, I dare say."

"Well, no, not exactly--though I've no objection to do that too in the
by-goin'.  But we've heard a report that a band o' Sioux are goin' to
visit the Settlement, and as there's a lot o' their enemies, the
Saulteaux, knocking about, I've bin sent to the fort by old McKay to see
if they've heard about the Sioux comin', an' if there's likely to be a
scrimmage, so as we may clear for action, d'ee see?"

"I see; and I hope there will be no need to clear for action.  I'm glad
to see Archie with you too," said Sutherland, "but surprised; for I
don't remember when I saw him without Little Bill on his back or at his
side."

"O, as to that, Little Bill has forsaken me," said Archie, "or I have
forsaken him--I'm not sure which--since Dan Davidson's accident, for he
does little else but sit at Dan's bedside, readin' to him or talking
with him."

"The dear little fellow could not be better employed," remarked the
Elder.

"The dear little fellow could be _much_ better employed," retorted the
boy, with unexpected decision.  "He could be rambling about the plains
or in the bush with me, getting strength to his muscles and fresh air to
his lungs, an' health to his body--to say nothing of his soul."

"Why, you are becoming jealous, lad," said Sutherland, with a laugh.

"No, I'm not _becoming_ jealous; I'm jealous already," returned the boy,
with an air that was half jocular, half serious.  "However, I'll
exercise patience a little longer, but I'm determined not to let Little
Bill be sacrificed for the sake of sick-nursing."

With this announcement of his unalterable resolve to stand to his guns,
and a "Brayvo, youngster!" from Jenkins, they parted and went on their
several ways.

It was found, when Fort Garry was reached, that the rumour of a visit
from the Sioux Indians was correct, and that some preparation was being
made for their reception, as well as precautions against any mischief
that might be contemplated, though there was not much to be apprehended
on that score, for the Sioux were believed to be among the bravest as
well as the most powerful of the nations east of the Rocky Mountains,
and less addicted to treachery or cruelty than most other tribes.

Two days later the Sioux made their appearance.  They formed only a
small band of warriors, but were a wild-looking though fine set of men;
erect, muscular, tall fellows, with the free bearing of practised
warriors, and in all the paint, charcoal, feathers, and leather-costume,
bear-claw collars, etcetera, peculiar to the western wilderness.

Their object, they said, was to smoke the pipe of peace with their
enemies the Saulteaux, and to see with their own eyes the wonderful
things that by report the Palefaces were doing in Red River.

"The Sioux have heard," said their principal chief, at a palaver with
the Governor, "that the Palefaces are building wooden Wigwams in number
like the stones on the shores of Lake Winnipeg; that they are growing
much grain; that they have set up many strange things which they compel
the wind to work for them, and so grind their grain; that they have
great heaps of powder and ball, and big wigwams that are bursting with
things that the Sioux love to exchange for the meat and skins of the
buffalo and other beasts great and small.  We have come to see all this
with our own eyes, for most of us are young men who have only heard of
such things from our fathers.  Waugh!"

Of course everything was said to encourage this laudable desire for
knowledge.  The visitors were shown over the fort.  Food was given to
them, and tobacco; then the pipe of peace was smoked with a band of
Saulteaux, which chanced to be on a friendly visit to the settlement at
the time, after which, as was customary on such occasions, both parties
mixed together and strolled about to see the settlers.

One party of them found their way to Prairie Cottage.  At some of the
houses nearer the fort they had learned the method of lifting the latch
of a door so as to obtain entrance.  Finding no one outside at the
cottage, they entered the central hall with the soft, quiet tread of the
panther.  As no one chanced to be there, they continued their
explorations with childlike simplicity, and thus most unexpectedly found
themselves in the bedroom of Dan Davidson, where Little Bill had just
read himself and his brother-invalid into a sound sleep.  Both wakened
up at once, and the boy sat bolt upright in blazing astonishment, but
Dan, who had heard of their arrival in the Settlement, received them
with a few words of welcome.

Fortunately for all parties, Okematan presented himself just then,
having, while at work in the garden, seen the party of Sioux arrive.  He
did his best to act the host, explaining to the visitors the cause of
Dan's weakness, and, by Dan's directions, offering them tobacco and
pipes.

While they were thus engaged, old McKay entered.

"I saw you comin', lads," he said, heartily.  "What cheer? what cheer?"
he added, shaking hands with them all round.

The Sioux were obviously much pleased with their reception, especially
when Mrs Davidson, Jessie, and Elspie, who had been out walking,
returned and joined the party.

After showing the Indians everything in the house, old McKay--who
constituted himself their guide,--took them out to see the live stock
and the farm.  He led them first into the garden.

It chanced at this time that there was a "snake in the grass" not far
off.  This was no other than the bad Indian Kateegoose.

Why some people are what we call naturally bad, like Kateegoose, while
others are what we call naturally good, like Okematan, is a mystery the
investigation of which we propose postponing to a more convenient
season.  Of course no sane person will maintain that this mystery frees
fallen man from responsibility.  If it did, we could no longer hang for
murder.  It would be the bounden duty of every judge, in that case, to
acquit every murderer with "Poor fellow, it was his fate; he could not
help it!" and send him away with a pat on the shoulder, and an order for
coffee and buns, perhaps, in his pocket.  As none but sane persons,
however, will read my book, it is not necessary to enlarge further on
this head.

Certain it is that Kateegoose was "bad"--obdurately bad--had been so
from his very cradle, if he ever had one, which is doubtful, and bade
fair to continue so to his grave.  Sutherland had button-holed him more
than once, but apparently in vain.  It is only fair to the savage to say
that he listened patiently to the Elder's remonstrances, and attentively
to his exhortations, and assumed an aspect of mild contrition that might
or might not have been sincere--as far as appearance went.

Now, it unfortunately happened that among the Sioux braves there was a
man who had done Kateegoose a deadly injury of some sort, which nothing
short of blood could wipe out.  Kateegoose, in familiar parlance,
spotted him at once, and dogged his steps through the Settlement,
watching his opportunity for revenge.  In savage life this dogging
process would not have been possible, but in a comparatively crowded
settlement, and in the midst of all the surprising novelties that
surrounded the Palefaces, it was all too easy; for Kateegoose took care
to keep as much as possible in the background, and well under cover of
houses, cottages, carts, stacks, and wigwams; besides which he had
painted his face in such a manner, and so modified his costume, that his
own acquaintances among the settlers--he had no friends--failed to
recognise him.  They, in their comparative ignorance of savage life, set
him down as one of the visitors, while the visitors, if they noticed him
at all, esteemed him one of the cross-breeds of the Settlement.

The only man who saw through the disguise of Kateegoose was Okematan,
who could not understand why he had adopted it, and who resolved to keep
a sharp eye on him.

The enemy of Kateegoose was one of the younger Sioux chiefs.  He led the
party which visited Prairie Cottage.

The garden of the Cottage, at its lower end towards the river,
approached close to the confines of a thick coppice.  It formed the
extremity of a belt of woodland which at that time bordered the river.
There a small summer-house had been erected by Dan and Peter Davidson
for the benefit of their mother and their sister Jessie.

Kateegoose, while dogging his foe, recognised this as a spot very
suitable for his fell purpose, as the contiguous wood afforded a ready
means of escape after the deed should be done.

While old McKay was conducting the Sioux slowly through the garden,
Kateegoose glided swiftly through the thicket to the spot where the
summer-house stood, and took up a position behind it, so that the party
in making the round of the garden would necessarily pass close to him.

From the window of Dan's room, Little Bill observed part of these
mysterious movements and suspected mischief.  Without uttering a word he
left the room, opened the front door, and gave a low whistle, which had
been set up as a private signal between him and Okematan.  In a few
seconds the Cree chief was by his side.

"Oke, there's mischief intended.  You'll have to be quick," he said,
quickly explaining what he had seen.

"Rejoin the party at once," he added, "and look out--sharp."

The chief nodded and walked away.  So swift, yet so quiet, had been his
movements that none of the whites of the party had observed his
departure from them.  The Sioux, however, had noticed it, and their
suspicions were aroused, especially when they saw him rejoin the party,
and observed that he walked rather closer to them than before.  But they
were proud warriors and refused by word, look, or movement, to indicate
their suspicions.  They carried bows in their hands, arrows in their
quivers, tomahawks and scalping-knives in their belts, but they scorned
to make any visible demonstration of being on guard in the midst of
Paleface friends, though they gave intense and undivided attention to
the movements of Okematan.

This concentration of attention on the wrong man was, of course, rather
favourable to the designs of Kateegoose, so that, when the party passed
the summer-house, he was enabled to spring upon his enemy, unobserved
for the first moment, with knife upraised.  But the stab from which the
Sioux chief could not have escaped was rendered harmless by the prompt
action of Okematan, who threw up his left arm, turned the blow aside,
and received a slight wound in doing so.

There was no time to repeat the blow.  With a yell of mingled defiance
and disappointment the would-be assassin leaped the garden fence,
bounded into the thicket, and disappeared.  A flight of Sioux arrows
entered the bush almost the moment after.  The young chief and his
friends also leaped the fence, and followed in pursuit.

The Sioux were swift and agile undoubtedly, but so was Kateegoose, and
he had the advantage of knowing the ground, while the trail--by which,
in ordinary circumstances, the Red-man can track his enemy through the
forest--was not available there in consequence of its being so mingled
up with the crossing and re-crossing of the innumerable tracks of
settlers.  The result was that Kateegoose made his escape.

The Colonists were very indignant at the perpetration of this cowardly
act, for it compromised their character for hospitality; and, if they
could have laid hands on the savage at the time, it is not impossible
that Lynch-law might have been applied to him.  The Governor also was
greatly annoyed, and in the afternoon of the following day made the
visitors a number of presents, besides providing for them a feast; but
all his good intentions were spoiled by Kateegoose, who had the audacity
to come forward and deliberately shoot his foe while the Sioux were at
meat.  The ball passed quite through the Sioux chief's body, and wounded
the man who was next to him.  After this dastardly act the villain fled,
and again got safe away.

The enraged Sioux, seizing their weapons, would have wreaked their
vengeance on the Saulteaux, if they could have discovered any; but these
wily savages had cleared away at the first note of alarm, and not one
was to be found.  To have attacked the whites with so small a party
would have been useless as well as unjust.  They therefore left the
colony in fierce anger.

It chanced that La Certe had pitched his tent the day before on a stream
not far-distant from the colony.  The Sioux had to pass that way, and,
espying the wigwam, turned aside to wreak their vengeance on whomsoever
it might contain.  Fortunately the owner of the mansion and his wife had
gone out fishing in a canoe, and taken the child with them.  All that
the Sioux could do, therefore, was to appropriate the poor man's goods
and chattels; but as the half-breed had taken his gun, ammunition, and
fishing-tackle with him, there was not much left to appropriate.  Having
despoiled the mansion, they set fire to it and went their way.

Returning in the evening, La Certe found his house a heap of ashes, and
himself reduced to a state of destitution.  This being his normal state,
however, he was not profoundly affected.  Neither was his wife; still
less was his child.

He said no word, but carried the contents of the canoe on shore.  His
wife, equally reticent, helped him.  His child, lighting its father's
pipe, sat down to smoke and look on.

They turned the canoe bottom up to serve as a partial shelter; they
kindled a huge fire before it; they set up three large fat ducks to
roast in front of it, and were soon busy with a simple but satisfying
supper.  After washing this down with an unstimulating draught of pure
water, they put the baby to bed under the bow of the canoe, filled their
pipes, and sat down before the ruddy blaze to mingle their hopes, joys,
prospects, and sorrows in a halo of smoke--the very personification of
primitive contentment and felicity.


CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.

VERY PERPLEXING INTERVIEWS WITH LITTLE BILL.

Things in the colony had at this time come to what may be styled a
complicated pass, for distress and starvation were rampant on the one
hand, while on the other hand the weather was superb, giving prospect at
last of a successful harvest.

The spring buffalo-hunt had been but partially successful, so that a
number of the buffalo runners had to make arrangements to support
themselves by fishing during the autumn in lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba.

In these great fresh-water seas there is an unlimited quantity of rich
and finely flavoured whitefish, or Titameg, besides other fish.  But
Titameg are only to be caught in large quantities during autumn, and of
course much of the success of fishing depends on weather--one gale
sometimes visiting the fishermen with ruin--ruin all the more complete
that the nets which may be carried away have in many cases to be paid
for out of the produce of the season's fishing.

In addition to the buffalo-hunters, who were obliged to support
themselves by fishing, there was a large number of idle half-breeds, of
a much lower type than these plain hunters, who had to betake themselves
to the same pursuit.  These were the "ne'er-do-weels" of the colony; men
who, like La Certe, with more or less--usually less--of his good-nature,
seemed to hold that all the industrious people in the world were created
to help or to support them and their families.  Of course when the
industrious people were unsuccessful, these idlers were obliged to work
for their living, which, being unaccustomed to do anything energetic,
they found it hard and difficult to do, and generally regarded
themselves as the harshly used victims of a tyrannous fate.

There was one thing, however, at which these idlers were very expert and
diligent--they begged well, and with persistency.  No wonder; for their
lives often depended on their persistent and successful begging.  The
Company and the private storekeepers were always more or less willing to
risk their goods by advancing them on credit.  Before the summer was
over, most of these people had got their supplies and were off to the
fishing grounds, regardless of the future, with large quantities of tea
and tobacco, and happy as kings are said to be--but never are, if
history be true!

Among these, of course, was La Certe.  That typical idler had made the
most of his misfortunes.  Everybody had heard what the Sioux had done to
him, and everybody had pitied him.  Pity opens the heart, and that opens
the hand; and, when the poor man entered a store with the polite manner
of a French Canadian and the humble aspect of a ruined man, he scarcely
required to beg.  One man lent him a tent.  Another lent him a canoe.
From the Company's store at Fort Garry he received a fair outfit of
nearly all that he could require.  Further down the Settlement there was
a private store-keeper with a jovial countenance.

"O it was a sad, sad sight!" he said to this man on entering the
store--"so very sad to see my tent in ashes, and nothing left--nothing--
absolutely!"  The jovial man was moved.  He gave La Certe what he asked
for--even pressed things on him, and also bestowed on him a considerable
"gratuity."

Still further down the Settlement the unfortunate man found the store,
or shop, of another friend.  This man was saturnine of countenance, but
moderately liberal of heart.  La Certe approached him with an air so
pitiful that the saturnine man melted like snow in the sunshine or wax
under heat.

"I have heard of your loss," he said, "and I will give you credit _this_
time, La Certe, though you _are_ so bad at paying your debts.  But I
won't give you much."

"I do not want much," returned the afflicted man in tones of deep
humility--"only a little--a very little."

By asking much more than he required, La Certe obtained as much as he
wanted from the saturnine man, and thus he finally started for Lake
Winnipeg with a canoe laden, almost to sinking, with the good things of
this life.

The fineness of that summer brought forth the fruits of the earth in
great luxuriance, and it really seemed as if at last the Scotch settlers
were going to reap some reward for all their prolonged perseverance and
industry.  The long rest, the good feeding, the sunshine of nature, and
the starlight of Elspie's eyes had a powerful effect on Dan Davidson's
health, so that, by the time autumn arrived and the prospects of a
splendid harvest became more certain every day, he had recovered much of
his usual strength of body and vigour of mind.

Little Bill also felt the genial influences around him, and, to the
intense joy of Archie, became visibly fatter and stronger, while his
large blue eyes lost some of that wistfully solemn appearance with which
they had been wont to gaze inquiringly into people's faces.

One afternoon Billie, having walked to the summer house in the Prairie
Cottage garden, along with Archie, was left alone there at his own
request, for, unlike other boys, he was fond of occasional solitary
meditation.

"Now mind, Little Bill--you whistle if you want me," said Archie, when
about to leave him.  "I'll hear you, for I'm only going to the
carpenter's shed."

"I will, Archie, if I want you; but I don't think I shall, for I can
walk by myself now, quite easily, as far as the house."

But Little Bill was not destined to be left to solitary meditations that
day, for his brother had not left him more than a few minutes when a
footstep was heard on the path outside, and next moment Fred Jenkins
presented himself at the opening of the summer-house.  The face of the
mariner betrayed him, for he was too honest by nature to dissemble
effectively.

"Well, Fred, how are you?  You seem a little disappointed, I think."

"Not exactly disappointed, Little Bill, but sort o' ways scumbusticated,
so to speak--perplexed, if I may say so.  Kind o' ways puzzled, d'ee
see?"

There was something very amusing in the manner of the strapping seaman
as he sat down beside the puny little boy, with a bashful expression on
his handsome face, as if he were about to make a humiliating confession.

"What troubles you, Jenkins?" asked Billie, with the air of a man who is
ready to give any amount of advice, or, if need be, consolation.

The seaman twisted his eyebrows into a complex form, and seemed
uncertain how to proceed.  Suddenly he made up his mind.

"Was you ever in love, Little Bill?" he asked abruptly, and with a smile
that seemed to indicate a feeling that the question was absurd.

"O yes," answered the boy quite coolly.  "I've been in love with brother
Archie ever since I can remember."

Jenkins looked at his little friend with a still more complicated knot
of puzzlement in his eyebrows, for he felt that Billie was scarcely
fitted by years or experience to be a useful confidant.  After resting
his hands on his knees, and his eyes on the ground, for some time, he
again made up his mind and turned to Billie, who sat with his large eyes
fixed earnestly on the countenance of his tall friend, wondering what
perplexed him so much, and waiting for further communications.

"Little Bill," said Jenkins, laying a large hand on his small knee, "in
course you can't be expected to understand what I wants to talk about,
but there's nobody else I'd like to speak to, and you're such a knowin'
little shaver that somehow I felt a kind of--of notion that I'd like to
ask your advice--d'ee see?"

"I see--all right," returned Billie; "though I wonder at such a man as
you wanting advice from the like of me.  But I'll do what I can for you,
Jenkins, and perhaps I know more about the thing that troubles you than
you think."

"I'm afraid not," returned the seaman, with a humorous twinkle in his
eye.  "You see, Billie, you never wanted to get spliced, did you?"

"Spliced!  What's that?"

"Well, I should have said married."

"O no!  I don't think the thought of that ever did occur to me.  I'm
sorry, Jenkins, but I really cannot give you advice on that subject."

"H'm!  I'm not so sure o' that, Little Bill.  You're such a practical
little chap that I do believe if you was put to it you'd be able to--
see, now.  If you happened to want to marry a nice little gal, what
would you do?"

"I would ask her," said Little Bill, promptly.

"Jus' so; but that is what I have not got courage to do."

Jenkins laughed at the expression of blazing surprise with which the boy
received this statement.

"Have not got courage!" he repeated; and then, after a pause--"Have all
the stories you have told me, then, been nothing but lies!"

"What stories, Billie?"

"Why, such as that one about the pirates in the Java seas, when ten of
them attacked you and you were obliged to kill four, and all the rest
ran away?"

"No, Billie--that was no lie: it was quite true.  But, then, these
blackguards were cowards at bottom, and they saw that I'd got a brace o'
double-barrelled pistols in my belt, and was pretty well up in the
cutlass exercise."

"And that time when you led a storming party against the fort in South
America, and was the only one left o' the party, and fought your way all
alone in through the breach till the troops came up and carried you on
with a rush, and--and--was all about that untrue?"

"Not a bit of it, Billie, though I wouldn't have you think I was
boastin' about it.  I only gave you the bare facts, which, like bare
poles, is as much as a ship can stand sometimes."

"An' that time you jumped overboard in Port Royal among the sharks to
save the little girl?"

"That's a fact, if ever there was one," said the seaman quickly, "for
the dear child is alive this good day to swear to it if need be."

"Yet you tell me," continued Little Bill, "that you have not the courage
to ask a nice little girl to marry you?"

"That's exactly how the matter stands, Billie."

It was now Billie's turn to look perplexed.

"Who is this nice little girl?" he asked abruptly, as if the answer to
that question might help to explain the enigma.

"Well--it's Elise Morel; an', mind, not a soul knows about that but you
an' me, Little Bill."

"But--but Elise is _not_ a little girl.  She's a big woman!"

Jenkins laughed as he explained that seamen sometimes had a habit--
mistaken, it might be--of calling even big women "nice little gals" when
they chanced to be fond of them.

"And are you _really_ afraid to ask Elise to marry you?" asked the boy,
earnestly.

"I suspect that's what's the matter wi' me," replied the sailor, with a
modest look.

"I always thought that nothing could frighten you," said Billie, in a
somewhat disappointed tone, for it seemed to him as if one of his idols
were shaking on its pedestal.  "I can't understand it, for _I_ would not
be afraid to ask her--if I wanted her."

At this Jenkins again laughed, and said that he believed him, and that
Billie would understand these things better when he was older.

"In the meantime, Little Bill," he continued, "I haven't got the heart
of a Mother Carey's chicken.  I could stand afore a broadside without
winkin', I believe; I think I could blow up a magazine, or fight the
French, as easy as I could eat my breakfast a'most, but to ask a pure,
beautiful angel like Elise to marry _me_, a common seaman--why, I hasn't
got it in me.  Yet I'm so fond o' that little gal that I'd strike my
colours to _her_ without firin' a single shot--"

"Does Elise want to marry _you_?" asked Billie.

"Oh, that's the very pint!" said the seaman with decision.  "If I could
only make sure o' that pint, I'd maybe manage to come up to the scratch.
Now, that's what I wants you to find out for me, Little Bill, an' I
know you're a good little shaver, as'll do a friend a good turn when you
can.  But you must on no account mention--"

He was going to have said, "You must on no account mention that I was
blabbing to you about this, or that I wanted to find out such a thing,"
when the sudden appearance of Elise's lap-dog announced the fact that
its mistress was approaching.

With a flushed face the bold seaman sprang up and darted out, as if to
attack one of those pirates of the Java seas who had made so powerful an
impression on Little Bill's mind.  But his object was escape--not
attack.  Lightly vaulting the garden fence, he disappeared into the same
thicket which, on another occasion, had afforded opportune refuge to
Kateegoose.  A few moments later Elise turned into the walk, and stood
before the summer-house.

"You here, Little Bill!" she exclaimed on entering, "I am very glad to
find you, for I have been alone all the morning.  Everybody is away--in
the fields, I suppose--and I don't like being alone."

"Was you ever in love, Elise?" asked the boy with a solemn countenance.

The girl laughed heartily, and blushed a little.

"What a strange question, Billie," she said; "why do you ask?"

"Well, it's not easy to explain all at once; but--but I want to know if
you want to be married?"

Elise laughed again, and, then, becoming suddenly grave, asked seriously
why Billie put such foolish questions.

"Because," said Little Bill, slowly, and with an earnest look, "Jenkins
is _very_ anxious to know if you are fond of him, and he actually says
that he's afraid to ask you to marry him!  Isn't that funny?  I said
that even _I_ would not be afraid to ask you, if I wanted you--How red
you are, Elise!  Have you been running?"

"O no," replied the girl, sheltering herself under another laugh; "and
what did he say to that?"

"He said a great many things.  I will try to remember them.  Let me
see--he said: `I haven't got the heart of a Mother Carey's
chicken,'--(he didn't tell me who Mother Carey is, but that's no matter,
for it was only one of her chickens he was speaking of);--`I could stand
afore a broadside without winkin','--(I give you his very words, Elise,
for I don't quite understand them myself);--`I could blow up a
magazine,' he went on, `or fight the French, as easy as I could eat my
breakfast, a'most, but to ask a pure an' beautiful angel like Elise'--
yes, indeed, you needn't shake your head; he said these very words
exactly--`a pure an' beautiful angel like Elise to marry _me_, a common
seaman, why, I hasn't got it in me.  Yet I'm so fond o' that little gal
that I'd strike my colours to her without firin' a single shot.'  Now,
do you understand all that, Elise? for I don't understand the half of
it."

"O yes, I understand a good deal of it, though some of it is indeed
puzzling, as you say.  But how did you come to recollect it all so well,
Little Bill?"

"Because he said he wanted me to help him, and to find out if you wanted
to marry him, so I paid particular attention to what he said, and--"

"Did he tell you to tell me all this?" asked Elise abruptly, and with
sudden gravity.

"O dear, no; but as he wanted me to find it out for him, and said that
not a soul knew about the matter but me, I thought the simplest way
would be to tell you all he said, and then ask you straight.  He was
going to tell me something more, very particularly, for he was just
saying, in a very solemn tone, `You must on no account mention--' when
your little dog bounced in and Jenkins bounced out, leaving the rest of
it unsaid."

"Then he has just left you?" said Elise.

"Just a moment or two before you came up.  I think he must have seen
some sort of beast in the wood, and gone in chase of it, he bolted in
such a hurry, so I don't know yet what I was not to mention."

"Now, Little Bill," said Elise with great seriousness of tone and
manner, "you must not tell Mr Jenkins one word of the conversation that
you and I have had just now."

"What! not a single word?"

"Not one.  You understand?"

"Yes, but, if he asks me, I must answer something, you know, and I must
not tell lies."

"Quite true, Billie.  You must not tell lies on any account whatever.
Now, listen.  If he asks you about our conversation this morning, you
must say that I told you you were never to open your lips about the
subject again either to me or to him or to anybody.  Mr Jenkins is an
honourable man, and will not ask you a single question after that."

"Then I'm not to tell him whether you want to marry him?"

"How can you tell him what you don't know?"

"Well, but, I mean that you're not going to tell me, so that I might
tell him?"

"Certainly not."

"Not a word to him and not a word to you--nor to anybody!  Not even to
Archie!"

"Yes.  That is exactly what you must promise me."

"This is a very unpleasant state of things," said Little Bill, with a
sad and puzzled countenance, "but of course I promise, for it is your
affair, you know."

It was a notable fact, which Little Bill did not fail to note--but did
not dare to mention--that after that date there was a distinct change of
demeanour in Elise Morel towards the handsome sailor--whether in his
favour or otherwise it was impossible to tell.

Meanwhile, events were pending which were destined to exercise a very
powerful influence over the fortunes of the Red River Colony, and,
indeed, over the condition of the whole of Rupert's Land.


CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.

THE FISHERY DISASTERS.

One fine day, when summer had merged into autumn, and things in Red
River appeared to be advancing favourably, and Dan Davidson had
recovered his strength, and Little Bill was fairly well, it occurred to
Okematan that he would like to go to Lake Winnipeg, and see how the
settlers who had gone to the fishery there, were getting on.

You see, the Cree chief was an observant savage, and, before returning
to his tribe, had made up his mind to see all the phases in the life of
the new Palefaces who had thus come to take possession of the land.

He was a remarkably independent fellow, and as he served the Davidsons
for nothing except his food--which he did not count, as he could easily
have supplied himself with victuals by means of his line, bow, and gun--
he did not deem it necessary to ask leave of absence.  He merely went to
the house one morning, and announced his intention of going to Lake
Winnipeg to fish.

"I will go with you," said Dan, to whom the announcement was made.

"An' so will I," said Fred Jenkins, who chanced to be conversing with
Dan at the time--"that is, if they can spare me just now."

"The canoe of Okematan," said the chief, "holds no more than three.  He
wishes to take with him Arch-ee and Leetil Bill."

"Very well," returned Dan, "there's no objection to that, for there is
not much doing on the farm at this moment, and Archie has worked hard
all the summer, so he deserves a holiday.  We will just make up the same
party that started last time, only that Fergus and I will take a
somewhat bigger canoe so as to accommodate you, Jenkins."

"Thankee.  Though I am big--unfort'nitly--I can stow myself away in
small compass, an' I've larned how, when there ain't overmuch grub, to
git along fairly well on short allowance.  When d'ee trip your anchor?--
I mean, when do ye start?"

"When to-morrow's sun touches the tree-tops in the east," said the
Indian chief.

"All right, Okematan, I'm your man--after layin' in a breakfast-cargo."

According to this arrangement the two canoes pushed off at daybreak the
following morning, from the wharf at the foot of the garden of Prairie
Cottage, and began the descent of the Red River, which, after flowing
between twenty and thirty miles northward, enters the mighty bosom of
Lake Winnipeg.  Okematan and Archie occupied their old places in the
stern and bow of the chief's canoe, with Little Bill in the middle--this
time using a paddle, for his strength had greatly increased.  The other
canoe was steered by Dan; Fergus acted bowman, and Jenkins sat between
them, also wielding a paddle.

That night they encamped on the banks of the river, for their progress
had been slow, owing to sundry visits which had to be paid to settlers
on the way down.

"Well, now," observed the sailor, as he stood by the camp-fire smoking
his pipe contemplatively, "I find that as circumstances change about in
this world men's minds are apt to go 'bout-ship along wi' them."

"That sounds a terribly profound speech, Fred," said Archie, who was
busy at his very usual occupation of whittling an arrow for his brother.
"Did your father teach it you, or did you crib it from a copy-book?"

"No, I raither think," retorted the seaman quietly, "that I got it from
your grandmother by the father's side."

"What may be the circumstance that has caused your mind to go about-ship
just now?" asked Dan, stirring the fire under the robbiboo-kettle.

"Well, it's in regard to them there canoe-paddles.  Although they do
seem small, compared with oars, I find they're quite big enough to do
the work, and although I've bin trained from a youngster to handle the
oar, an' go like a crab with my back the way I'm pullin', it do seem
more sensible-like to sit wi' one's face to the front and drive ahead;--
anyhow, it's more comfortable and satisfactory."

"Look out, Jenkins!" exclaimed Little Bill, "else your duck won't be
satisfactory--it's burnin' now."

"O, never mind," remarked Fergus, lighting his pipe.  "It iss havin' it
well done he would be fond of."

"Ay, but not over-done," cried the seaman, snatching the duck in
question from before the blaze and turning its other side--for they used
no spits in the Nor'-West in those days, but cooked one side at a time--
nay, even carved off and ate part of the cooked side while the other
side was roasting.

Next day they came out on the ocean-like expanse of the great lake, and
steered along its western shores until they reached the fishery, where
numbers of rudely-constructed wigwams and a few tents sheltered the
fishing community.

They had just returned from a successful visit to the nets when the
visitors arrived, and all was animation and rejoicing at the successful
take.  Jacques Bourassin was the first man they met on landing, and he
was enthusiastic about the prospects before them.  Slowfoot was the
first woman, and she was quite satisfied--in that amiable state of
mental and physical felicity in which it is so easy to believe that "all
is for the best."  Her husband soon after appeared.  He, of course, was
also greatly pleased.  He had joined the fishers because he believed
that plenty of food, tea, and tobacco would be going amongst them.  He
was not mistaken.

"You will come to my tent," he said, in the wealth of his hospitality;
"we have plenty of good fish, a very little meat, some tobacco, and
oceans of tea!"

The six visitors accepted the invitation, and were soon made acquainted
with all the gossip of the community.

"Does it always smoke?" whispered Little Bill to his brother.

The "it" referred to was Baby La Certe, which had, as usual, possessed
itself of its father's pipe when the mother was not watching.

"I'm not sure, Little Bill, but I think that it does its best."

It was observed, especially by Fred Jenkins, that the tea-drinking which
went on at this place was something marvellous.

"There's that squaw sittin' there," he said, "she's bin an' swigged
three pannikins o' tea while I've bin looking at her--an' it's as black
as ink.  What's that brown stuff they put into it, does any one know?"

"That?  Why, it is maple sugar," answered Archie, "an' capital stuff it
is to eat too."

"Ah, I know that, for I've ate it in lump, but it can't be so good in
tea, I fancy, as or'nary brown or white sugar; but it's better than fat,
anyhow."

"Fat!" exclaimed Little Bill, "surely you never heard of any one taking
fat in tea, did you?"

"Ay, that I did.  Men that move about the world see strange things.  Far
stranger things than people invent out o' their own brains.  Why, there
was one tribe that I saw in the East who putt fat in the tea, an'
another putt salt, and after they'd swallowed this queer kind of
tea-soup, they divided the leaves among themselves an' chawed 'em up
like baccy."

The evident delight with which these half-breeds and more than
half-Indians swallowed cup after cup of the blackest and bitterest tea,
proved beyond question their appreciation of the article, and afforded
presumptive evidence at least that tea is not in their case as poisonous
as we are taught to believe.

But it was not, as Jenkins remarked, all fair weather, fun, and tea at
the fishery.  After the six visitors had been there for a week, shooting
and assisting in the canoes, and at the nets, there came a night when
the forces of Nature declared war against the half-breeds and those
settlers who had cast in their lot with them at that time.

Jenkins, Okematan, and Archie had been out with their guns that day--the
last having been promoted to the use of the dangerous weapon--and in
their wanderings had about nightfall come upon a family of half-breeds
named Dobelle, a good-natured set, who lived, like La Certe, on the
_laissez faire_ principle; who dwelt in a little log-hut of their own
construction within the margin of the forest, not far from the shore of
the great lake.

This family, though claiming to be Christian and civilised, was little
better than vagrant and savage.  They were to some extent as independent
as the brute creation around them--though of course they betrayed the
inherent weakness of mankind in being unable to exist happily without
tea, sugar, and tobacco.  For the rest, their wants were few and easily
satisfied.  Snares provided willow-grouse and rabbits; traps gave them
furs and the means of purchasing guns and powder.  Their log-hut was
only an occasional residence.  Wherever night overtook them they were at
home.  They camped on the open plains, in the woods, among the rocks,
and on the margins of rivers and lakes.  Healthy, happy, and heedless,
the Dobelle family cared for nothing apparently, but the comfort of the
passing hour; regarded the past as a convenient magazine from which to
draw subjects for gossip and amusement, and left the future to look
after itself.

There were in the hut, when the three visitors entered, old Dobelle, his
wife, a daughter of eighteen, another of four, and two sons of twenty
and twenty-two respectively.

"It looks like dirty weather," said Jenkins on entering; "will you let
us come to an anchor here for a bit?"

"Give us shelter?" explained Archie, who doubted old Dobelle's ability
to understand nautical language.

"You are welcome," said the half-breed, making way politely, and
pointing to places on the floor where the visitors were expected to
squat.  For there was no furniture in that mansion; the fire was kindled
in the middle of its one room; the family sat around it on deer and
buffalo skins, and the smoke alike of pipe and fire found egress at the
crevices in the roof.

With kind hospitality Madame Dobelle poured some black tea into cups of
birch-bark, and, on plates of the same material, spread before them the
remains of a feast of roasted fish.

While eating this, various questions were put as to the success of the
fishery.

"Yes--we have been very successful," said old Dobelle.  "No bad weather
to speak of, and plenty of fish.  Our good fortune is great."

"But it won't last long," said the eldest son, who seemed to be the only
growler in the family.

"_N'importe_--we will enjoy it while it lasts," said the younger son.

"Yes, truly we will," remarked Madame Dobelle.  Whereupon the daughter
of eighteen smiled, and the daughter of four giggled.

"What does Okematan think?" asked the host.

Thus appealed to, the chief gave it as his opinion that something was
going to happen, for the sky in the nor'-west looked uncommonly black.
Having given utterance to this cautious remark he relapsed into silence.

As if to justify his opinion, a tremendous clap of thunder seemed to
rend the heavens at that moment, and, a few minutes later, a heavy
shower of rain fell.

"Well that we got inside before that came on," said Archie.  "I hope it
won't come on to blow, else we shall be storm-stayed here."

The weather seemed to be in a lively mood that night, for as the thunder
had promptly answered to Okematan's observation, so now the wind replied
to Archie's remark, by rushing up the natural avenue which extended from
the hut to the lake and almost bursting in the door.

"See to the ropes, boys," said old Dobelle, glancing uneasily at the
roof.

The young men arose, went out, regardless of weather, and secured with
additional care a couple of stout ropes with which the tendency of the
roof to fly away was restrained.

"Did it ever come off?" asked Archie with some curiosity, as the young
men returned and resumed their pipes.

"Yes--twice, and both times it was night," answered Madame Dobelle, "and
we were flooded out and had to camp under the trees."

"Which was not comfortable," added the old man.  Another clap of thunder
seemed to corroborate what he said, and a blast of wind followed, which
caused the whole fabric of the hut to shudder.  Jenkins looked
inquiringly at the roof.

"No fear of it," said old Dobelle; "the ropes are strong."

Thus assured, the visitors continued their meal with equanimity,
regardless of the storm that soon began to rage with great fury,
insomuch that the door required a prop to keep it up and rain began to
trickle in through crevices in the roof and drop here and there upon the
party.  When one such drop chanced to fall on old Dobelle's nose, his
younger son arose, and, fastening a piece of birch-bark to the rafters,
caught the drop and trained it with its followers to flow towards an
unoccupied place in one corner, which, being accidentally lower than the
rest of the floor, formed a convenient receptacle for superfluous water.

At the same time Madame Dobelle made a shakedown of pine-branches in
another corner for her visitors, for it was obvious that they would have
to spend the night there, even although their own tent was not
far-distant.

By that time the storm was raging with unwonted violence.  Nevertheless
the Dobelle family smoked on in placid contentment.  When the time for
repose arrived, Madame Dobelle and her eldest girl retired to a box-bed
in a corner of the hut which was screened off--not very effectually--by
a curtain of birch-bark.  The two brothers lay down in another corner.
The three visitors disposed themselves in the third, and, as the fourth
was monopolised by the rain-rivulet, old Dobelle lay down on one side of
the fire in the centre of the room, while the four-year-old girl reposed
on the other.

During the night the accumulation of tobacco-smoke with fire-smoke
produced a suffocating effect, but no one was capable of suffocation
apparently, for they all smoked on--except Archie, who, as we have said,
had not acquired the habit.  Even the four-year-old girl, like Baby La
Certe, had a pull now and then at its father's pipe, and, from sundry
white emanations from the crevices in the bark curtains, it was evident
that the ladies behind these were enjoying themselves in the same way
during the intervals of repose.

Next morning was fine, and the three sportsmen returned to the fishery
to find that the storm had made an almost clean sweep of the nets.  It
had carried most of them away; torn others to pieces, and almost ruined
the whole colony of fishermen; the ruin being all the more complete that
most of the nets had been received on credit, and were to be paid for
chiefly by the results of the autumn fishery.

La Certe was one of the chief sufferers; nevertheless, to judge from his
looks, La Certe did not suffer much!  He had brought a considerable
amount of provision with him, as we have said, and, finding that one of
his nets had been washed ashore, he proceeded very leisurely to mend it,
while he smoked and assisted Slowfoot to consume pemmican and tea.

About this time a mysterious message was sent to Dan Davidson from Red
River by an Indian, requiring his immediate return.  The sender of the
message was Elspie McKay; the summons was therefore obeyed at once.

As nothing further could be done at the fishery that autumn, the other
members of the expedition, and most of the fishers, returned with Dan to
the colony.


CHAPTER THIRTY.

THE TRIAL FOR MURDER.

"Dan," said Elspie, as, seated in the summer-house after the arrival of
the sportsmen, these two held a meeting, "I have called you back to tell
you of a very terrible thing which has been said of my dear brother
Duncan, and which you must contradict at once, and then find out how it
was that the false report arose, and have the matter cleared up."

"Dear Elspie," returned Dan, "I think I know what you are going to tell
me."

"Have you heard the report, then?" said Elspie, turning pale, "and--and
do you believe it?"

"I have suspected--I have--but let me hear first what the report is, and
who it came from."

"I got it from Annette Pierre, and I am sure she would not have told it
me if she did not think it true; but, then, poor Annette is not very
intelligent, and she may be--must be--mistaken.  She says that it was
Duncan who killed poor Henri Perrin, and that some of the half-breeds
are determined to avenge the death of their comrade.  Now, it cannot be
true; and I want you at once to go and ferret out the truth, so as to
prove the report false."

"Have you spoken to Duncan on the subject?" asked Dan.

"No, I cannot bear to let him imagine even for a moment that I could
believe him guilty of murder--that I even suspected him of it.  But you
say you have heard something, Dan--that you suspect something.  What is
it?"

"It is difficult to say, Elspie dear.  I, too, have heard the rumour
that has come to your ears, and I have seen--but it is useless talking
of our mere conjectures.  I will go at once and ferret out all about it
if possible.  My first business will be to see Annette and get from her
all that she knows.  Where is Duncan?"

"In the wheat-field.  They have begun to shear to-day, and, as the crop
is heavy, they will be glad of your help."

Dan went to the field, after visiting Annette Pierre, and lent good
assistance to the shearers, but, like Elspie, he found that he had not
courage to say anything to Duncan that would indicate his suspicion.  He
longed to put the question straight to him, but could not prevail on
himself to do so.

Next morning, however, he and Elspie were both saved the necessity of
doing such violence to their feelings, by the arrival of two men from
Fort Garry.  They were members of a sort of police force that the
Company had enrolled, and had come to arrest Duncan McKay junior, on the
charge of murder!

There was not much of law in the colony at that time, but it was felt
that something had to be done in the way of governing a settlement which
was rapidly increasing, and in which Lynch and mob law would certainly
be applied if regularly constituted authority did not step in.  As the
murder of Perrin had created great indignation among the half-breeds,
and the feeling about it was increasing, the Company resolved to clear
the matter up by having the supposed murderer tried.  Duncan was
accordingly lodged in one of the bastions of Fort Garry, where, when
visited by the Governor, he firmly denied his guilt.

The arrest of his younger son on such a charge fell very heavily on poor
Duncan McKay senior--more heavily than those who knew him would have
expected.  It touched not only his feelings but his pride; for was he
not a lineal descendant of that Fergus McKay who had been a chief in one
of the Western Isles of Scotland--he could not tell which, but no
matter--at that celebrated period of Scottish history when the great
Norse king, Harold Fairhair, had made a descent on the Scottish coast
and received one of the few thorough thrashings that darkened his
otherwise successful career?

"O!  Tuncan, Tuncan, my boy!" cried the old man, shoving his hands
deeper into his breeches pockets, and apostrophising his imprisoned son
as he walked up and down in the privacy of his own bedroom.  "O that wan
o' the name should come to such disgrace!  An' it's denyin' it you will
be, whether you are guilty or innocent.  O Tuncan, Tuncan! you wass ever
notorious for tellin' lies--an' a troublesome boy all round--whatever."

But when the old man went to Fort Garry and visited his son, he stifled
his pathetic feelings, and appeared before him with all the offended
dignity of an injured member of the great clan McKay.

"Are you guilty, Tuncan?" he asked, sternly.

"No, I'm innocent," answered the youthful Highlander, with a brow quite
as stern and a manner as dignified as the old one.

"You will hev to prove that--whatever."

"No--they will hev to prove me guilty," retorted the son.

"I wish I could believe ye, Tuncan."

"It iss not of much consequence whether ye believe me or not, father.
You are not to be my chudge--whatever."

"That is goot luck for you, Tuncan, for if I wass your chudge I would be
bound to condemn you--you wass always so fond o' tellin' lies."

"It iss true what you say, father.  It iss a chip o' the old block that
I am--more's the peety."  At this point the door of the prison opened,
and Elspie was ushered in.

"You here, father!" she exclaimed in evident surprise.  "I had hoped to
see Duncan alone."

"It iss alone with him you'll soon be," replied the Highlander, putting
on his hat.  "Goot tay, Tuncan, my boy, an' see that you'll be tellin'
the truth, if ye can, when ye come to be tried."

To this the youth made no reply.

"O Duncan!" said the girl, when her father had retired, "how came they
to invent such lies about you?"

The tender way in which this was said, and the gentle touch on his arm,
almost overcame the stubborn man, but he steeled himself against such
influences.

"What can I say, Elspie?" he replied.  "How can I tell what iss the
reason that people tell lies?"

"But it _is_ lies, isn't it, Duncan?" asked the poor girl, almost
entreatingly.

"You say that it iss lies--whatever, an' I will not be contradictin'
you.  But when the trial comes on you will see that it cannot be proved
against me, Elspie--so keep your mind easy."

With this rather unsatisfactory assurance, Elspie was fain to rest
content, and she returned home a little, though not much, easier in her
mind.

To make the trial quite fair and regular, a jury of twelve men, chosen
by lot from a large number, was empanelled, and as many witnesses as
possible were examined.  These last were not numerous, and it is
needless to say that Annette Pierre and Marie Blanc were the chief.  But
despite their evidence and the strong feeling that existed against the
prisoner, it was found impossible to convict him, so that in the end he
was acquitted and set free.  But there were men in the colony who
registered a vow that Cloudbrow should not escape.  They believed him to
be guilty, in spite of the trial, and made up their minds patiently to
bide their time.

It now seemed as if at last a measure of prosperity were about to dawn
upon the farmers in that distant land, and, as usual on such occasions
of approaching prosperity, Dan Davidson and Duncan McKay senior began to
talk of the wedding which had been so long delayed.

Gabriel had spoken several times with the cadet. When the boy was found
in the cloisters, looking for conversation pegábase him, to justify
their presence in these talks in Clavería. Luna was shocked to see him
there in the afternoon festivities. - But are you not going to
bulls - he asked -.

All of the Academy must be in the plaza. Giovannino smiled, caressing
the mustache.

It was his favorite gesture, and stood with satisfaction the sleeve,
adorned with gallons of sergeant.

There was a cadet one: it was a "gallon", and this, even for the little
dreams of the generals, always one step ahead ... No, he was not going
to bulls, it was really an amateur, but was sacrificed by an evening
talk with the bride at the door of his home in the silence of
Clavería.

The grandmother had fallen into the garden and _Azul of Virgen_ it would
soon quit, leaving the field open, as if it learns nothing. The great
late friend Gabriel! He was more serious and important occupations as
those of the novices of the Academy, who spent Sunday in the cafes
or just walking around like stupid.

His girlfriend all in the enviable Alcazar: to teachers. - When is
the wedding? - Gabriel said cheerfully. The 'gallons' replied with
an expression of man. There were many things to do before: to convince
his uncle, which was not easy, and follow the impulses of his star,
until you reach a certain height. It was reserved for big things.
It was a matter of few years. - I, my friend Luna, I am of the young wood
of the generals. It is the shade of the family.

My uncle has that as an altar boy, was sure to Cardinal, and has
arrived.

I rise very quickly. Besides, you know that an archbishop of Toledo
was not anything, and that the uncle had relations in the palace
and send in the Ministry of War as well as if a general. As is
more military than cure! To prove it, here is the only thing that has
written a prayer to the Virgin, to recite the soldiers before
entering fire. - And you, Juanito,'s vocation military feels really
- A lot. I knew from reading books and open up, I wanted to be equal
to the great masters who saw blades, upright on the horse, with sword
in hand, beautiful and arrogant. You created in this race that no one
enters without calling. The seminars are locked many against their
will, but nobody involved in the military strength which comes to
the Academy because it comes from within. And everyone is so sure
of success as you - Oh, all! - said the nephew of Cardinal smiling -.
Except that the vast majority do not have the same chances for career
advancement.

But with as many as we are, there is not one to think of the
possibility of becoming a master of vegging reserve regiment, dying
or getting old, when more, commander.

All we first highlighted by the youth uniform, for the adventures
(because you know that women dags for us), the joy of life, loved
and respected at all times over a span of the peasant, then, when
approaching old age and a weight and start to become bald, the belt,
policymakers, and who knows if the portfolio of War!

This is the idea of all. No I do not think that the future awaits you
in a band, and will not have downloaded more than ponérsela to the waist.
I know certainly that I expected. Imagine what the others ... and let
live. Gabriel smiled at hearing cadet. - You are a deluded, like those
poor guys who come into the seminar thinking that awaits miter or
a great sinecure on the other side of the door.

Seduction is still carrying the dead after they were big things. Let's
see ... apart from the material result of the race, why are you military
... - For the glory! - campanudamente cadet said, recalling the
harangues of Colonel-director of the Academy -. For the motherland, whose
defense was entrusted to us! For the honor of our flag! - The Glory!
- Gabriel said ironically -. I know that.

Many times, seeing you so young, so inexperienced, so full of vain
hopes, I have redone my interior which could be called the psychology
of the cadet.

I guess what you have thought about before entering the Academy and I
anticipate the overwhelming and bitter disappointment that awaited
them at the exit.

The stories of wars and martial arts uniforms have seduced her childhood.
After the reading of a poem bellicose irresistible: Bonaparte,
with their banners, moving bridge between Arcole clouds of shrapnel,
big as a god, then our overall go home Espartero in Luchana, O'Donnell
in Africa, and above all, Prim, the almost legendary leader, leading
with his sword in Castillejos battalions: "I want the same thing -
they say the boys -; where a man comes, you can reach another."

Enthusiasm is taken by predestination, and each cree made by God
to be a famous leader. While living here in Toledo, are dreaming of
glory, with risky business, with huge battles and triumphs noisy. But
when the two stars in the manga is going to a regiment, the first
thing that comes to welcoming you at the door of the barracks,
almost before the greeting of the sentinel, the reality is ugly and
unfriendly.

Anyone who dreamed of glory and be filled famous warlord before the age
of thirty, thinking not only in strategic combinations and original
fortifications, it must deal with the washing and adecentamiento
a few narrow mozos smell coming from the field to excessive health test
the ranch, talk about their underwear and shirts, and calculate
the length of borceguíes and sandals.

Which never came into the kitchen of his home and was caring for her
mother carefully, ignoring things like women all that was not to bring
voices of command and soldiers, the first being encountered in the
military is the need to be cook, tailor, shoemaker, etc., often
holding their revulsion because it demonstrated superior expertise
in these tasks. - True - Juanito said, laughing - but without it
there can be no army and the army is necessary. -- Not discussing
whether or not it is necessary.

I mean only that you (and if you do not, because it comes right foot,
your colleagues) are tricked, prepared without knowing the failure of
life, like those other young people, poorer or less energetic, run to
enter the Church. The Church ended because there is no faith, and
military glory has ended forever in Spain because there are no wars
of conquest, power and character of our battle is lost, thankfully,
for centuries.

If we still have a war, civil or colonial wars that might call zompas,
dull and without benefits, where men die as well as at Thermopylae or
in Austerlitz, because once you lose life, but without the consolation
of fame and public admiration, without the aura of what we call
glory.

You were born too late. The brightness of other ages are attracted to
their illusion, but arriving late to call. You are the warriors of a
people necessarily have to live in peace, as the seminarians are the
future priests of a country that no longer make miracles, no faith,
but routine and laziness of thought. - But if you already We have
no foreign wars, conquests eventually if served at least to defend
the integrity of Spanish soil, to save the house.

Do you cree - added amoscado the cadet - we are not able to die for the
homeland? - No doubt that is the only thing to serve the Spanish-to
die very heroically, but in the end die.

Our history two centuries ago that no more heroic deaths. 'Glorious
failure of such party. "" Heroico another such disaster. "By land
and sea have caused shock in the world, throwing with his eyes
closed in danger, with no head to run away, with the stoicism of
the Chinese.

But nations are not great for his contempt of death, but for its ability
to preserve life.

Poles were the terror of the Turks and some of the best soldiers of
Europe, Poland is long and there .... If a major European power could
invade (note that you say 'could', because in these matters is not the
same as wanting power), from here I know what would happen.

The Spaniards knew die, but you will have the assurance that the
invaders would not need more than two battles to end all our means
of warfare.

And that can be undone in a couple of days, how many sacrifices it to the
country ... - Then - ironically, the cadet said - need to abolish the
army and leave the nation defenseless. - Today should not expect that to
happen.

While Europe is armed and even the smallest nation to have an army, it
will also Spain. She is not going to lead by example, this example would
not do.

It is as if to redress social injustice begin a slaughter that took
only a few thousand pesetas, renouncing them .... After a long silence,
Gabriel spoke gently, given the aggressive and almost ironic gesture of
cadet. -- -You will undoubtedly hurt my assertions. Create what you feel,
because I do not like to offend anyone's beliefs, and those that make
up the ideal of our life. But the truth is the truth. You will
not care about anything the social question, is not it? Neither knows
nor should it concern a single instant. The same will happen to all his
fellow profession, however, what you face in their prestige, their love
of their motherland and flag, no other reason that the social
disorder that reigns in the world today.

Wealth is everything, the capital is the lord of the land. Science
applied to mankind as a successor to the faith, but the rich have taken
their findings and to perpetuate its monopoly over tyranny.

In the economic world have become owners of the machines and other advances,
using them as channels for enslaving the worker, forcing him to over-production
and limit their wages to the minimum necessary. In the life of
nations the same. Today the war is merely an application of science.

The richest people have taken over the major advances in the art
of extermination, they have herds of battleships, thousands of
monstrous guns can hold millions of men over weapons, with all the
modern improvements, with no break his fortune.

A poor people are left with only the use of streets or unnecessarily
indignant, as do the disinherited to the holders of the property.

The most cowardly people on the globe, or more sedentary, you may
be invincible warrior or conqueror glorious if you have money.

The value chivalry ended with the invention of gunpowder, and ferocity
of the race has died forever with the advent of industrialism. If the
rise Cid be in prison, a thief would have been spent on roads, unable
to cope with the inequalities and injustices of modern life. If
the Grand Master was now Minister of War, we would see how they are
arranged, even with the military budget that haunts the nation,
to put their thirds in terms of support for a new battle in Italy.

Is money, money! Damn! who kills the most beautiful part of the soldier,
the personal courage, initiative, originality, and cancels the worker,
making their existence in hell. The cadet Gabriel listened carefully,
realizing for the first time in major military powers had more than the
warlike passions of the monarch and the value of armies. Suddenly he saw
wealth as a base and spring of all companies warrior. - So - said with
pensive expression - if foreigners stop attacking us, not because
we are afraid ... - No, if we allow live peacefully, it is because
these omnipotent powers, with its ambitions and jealousies, in
balance.

They are like the great capitalists, who, occupied in large conceptions
of exploitation, neglect and contempt by leaving existing industries
around them modest.

Do you think that Switzerland and Belgium and other small countries
live peacefully among major powers locked away because they have an army?
The same if there had not a soldier. And Spain, for its military might,
is just one of the small nations of Europe.

Economic poverty and the shortage of people forcing us to humility.
Today there are two categories of hosts: those organized for the
conquest and that only served to keep internal order, which are a
big police with guns and generals.

In Spain, however much it costs and even if you enlarge, do not quit this
classification. - And if only that - the cadet said - is not that
something?

Keep internal order, we ensure the peace of the homeland ... - Well,
that can be done with fewer people and less money. Also, what about
the glory?

You, young people full of illusions, lush curb, with new energy to
businesses, is resigned to that career guards and caretakers of a
nation? Their future is as monotonous as that of a cleric of the cathedral.
Every day the same: to train men to move this way or the other,
playing dominoes or billiards in a cafe, walking in uniform or get
a sleep on the couch in the fourth flag.

There can be no other event special to you that a mutiny against the
consumption tax, a strike closed shops in protest of the taxes,
and then fire on a crowd armed with sticks and stones.

If we ever send you shoot in your life, be certain that it will be
against Spain. Governments do not want army: they know it is useless
for external defense of the nation, as the fortune not to allow their
maintenance, and need only an embryonic organization, who lives in the
disorder, agitated by incessant and contradictory reforms, copying the
developments abroad, as a poor girl mimics the galas of the great
lady.

You create that is not nice to live a life of drudgery and sobered, with
another shot at glory that worker protest or the people who
complain. - But what about freedom?, And political progress - asked
Cadet -. I heard an old master of the Academy, that if in Spain there
is the liberal regime by the army. - Much of it is - said Gabriel -.

Is undoubtedly the most important service that the army has given to
Spain. Without him, who knows what would have stopped the civil
war in this country as state and timid before the reforms!

I repeat: do not know this service, but you create civil war between
freedom and political absolutism is not repeated, as they could not
reproduce successfully the war of Independence. The media and military
progress have been killed in mountain warfare. The Mauser, which is the
weapon of the day, you need to keep behind a well-equipped fleet,
have stores of ammunition on his back, and this is incompatible
with the war games. - But you will recognize that something that
we serve and loans the nation a good service. - I recognize within
the existing order of things.

But even better if they recognize you less. Consume the best part of
the budget, yet you live in a decent and concealed misery, misery
fart at the end.

A deputy workers earn less than certain, and must afford uniforms showy,
go clean, and often, when you need entertainment, the same places as the
rich. Just go to the long years of waiting and hidden poverty, overcome
with dignity, until he gives up a few more tough months. You suffer in
this life dragging proletarians of the sword, and the nation
watching them inactive producer claims, and other superfluous
expenditures to forget to look only in the military.

Believe me you: for modern army, you are very few and poorly organized
to guard inside, and many are expensive. Not your fault. It was late
to his vocation, Spain is dead when, fortunately, for the adventurous
companies. If revived, it does not follow a direction that will certainly
be that of the sword.

I say that is wrong by the way young people seeking the glory find where
they believed their ancestors.

_Vara The appearance of the cut plata_ dialogue. Ran, pale with excitement,
panting, shaking his bunch of keys. - His Eminence is coming -
said hastily -.

Already in the arc. He wants to spend an afternoon in the garden. It's a
little ...! Today they say that it is unbearable.

And ran to open the staircase Tenorio, which challenged the
communication with the faculty Clavería low.

The cadet was alarmed by the unexpected closeness of his uncle. I did
not want to be there: he feared the cardinal's, and fled to the stairwell
of the tower. Goes to the bulls, sacrificed to the bride before meeting
with Don Sebastian.

Gabriel, to be alone in the cloister, is leaning to one columns,
looking far over fearsome prince of the Church.

Saw him leave through the door that led to the department gigantones.
Was followed by two relatives. Luna was able to review either for the
first time. It was huge, and despite his age, stood erect. On the black
cassock with red piping rested the cross of gold.

Was supported by a baton with some martial and gold tassels on his
hat fell his greasy neck, a pink skin and covered with white hairs.

His eyes looked small and penetrating everywhere in the hope of
finding an oversight, something that violates the rules, to erupt
in shouts and threats that would exit the moodiness and anger
reconcentrada that fruncían its entrecejo.

Disappeared by the ladder Preceded by Don Tenorio Antolín which,
after opening the gates, had placed their orders, trembling with
fear.

The silence and solitude of Clavería not altered. It seemed that people
hid in the houses was still, guessing the danger passed.

Gabriel, leaning on the railing, he saw the Cardinal went on to faculty,
visiting two of its galleries up to the gate of the garden.

In a few days, Fergus returned from the plains, bringing his brother in
a cart, which had been made tolerably easy by means of a springy couch
of pine-branches.  They did not tell him at first of his father's
illness, lest it should interfere with his own recovery from the very
critical condition in which he lay.  At first he took no notice of his
father's non-appearance, attributing it to indifference; but when he
began slowly to mend, he expressed some surprise.  Then they told him.

Whatever may have been his thoughts on the subject, he gave no sign, but
received the information--as, indeed, he received nearly all information
at that time--in absolute silence.

Fortunately, the bullet which struck him had passed right through his
side, so that he was spared the pain, as well as the danger, of its
extraction.  But, from his total loss of appetite and continued
weakness, it was evident that he had received some very severe, if not
fatal, internal injury.  At last, very slowly, he began to grow a little
stronger, but he was a very shadow or wreck of his former self.
Nevertheless, the more sanguine members of the family began to entertain
some faint hope of his recovery.

Of course, during these first days of his weakness his sister Elspie
nursed him.  She would, if permitted, have done so night and day, but in
this matter she had to contend with one who was more than a match for
her.  This was Old Peg, the faithful domestic.

"No, no, dearie," said that resolute old woman, when Elspie first
promulgated to her the idea of sitting up all night with Duncan, "you
will do nothin' of the sort.  Your sainted mother left your father an'
Fergus an' yourself to my care, an' I said I would never fail you, so I
can't break my promise by letting you break your health.  I will sit up
wi' him, as I've done many a time when he was a bairn."

It thus came to pass that Elspie nursed her brother by day, and Old Peg
sat up with him at night.  Of course the duties of the former were
considerably lightened by the assistance rendered by various members of
the family, as well as friends, who were ever ready to sit by the
bedside of the wounded man and read to or chat with him.  At such times
he was moderately cheerful, but when the night watches came, and Old Peg
took her place beside him, and memory had time to commence with him
undisturbed, the deed of which he had had been guilty was forced upon
him; Conscience was awakened, and self-condemnation was the result.
Yet, so inconsistent is poor humanity that self-exculpation warred with
self-condemnation in the same brain!  The miserable man would have given
all he possessed to have been able to persuade himself that his act was
purely one of self-defence--as no doubt to some extent it was, for if he
had not fired first Perrin's action showed that he would certainly have
been the man-slayer.  But, then, young McKay could not shut his eyes to
the fact that premeditation had, in the first instance, induced him to
extend his hand towards his gun, and this first act it was which had
caused all the rest.

Often during the wakeful hours of the night would the invalid glance at
his nurse with a longing desire to unburden his soul to her, but
whenever his eye rested on her calm, wrinkled old visage, and he thought
of her deafness, and the difficulty of making her understand, he
abandoned his half-formed intention with a sigh.  He did not, indeed,
doubt her sympathy, for many a time during his life, especially when a
child, had he experienced the strength and tenderness of that.

After attending to his wants, it was the habit of Old Peg to put on a
pair of tortoise-shell spectacles and read.  Her only book was the
Bible.  She read nothing else--to say truth, at that time there was
little else to read in Red River.  The first night of her watch she had
asked the invalid if he would like her to read a few verses to him.

"You may if you like, Peg," he had replied.  "You know it iss little I
care for releegion, for I don't believe in it, but you may read if you
like--it may amuse me, an' will help to make the time pass--whatever."

Thus the custom was established.  It was plain that the old woman
counted much on the influence of the simple Word of God, without
comment, for every time she opened the Bible she shut her eyes and her
lips moved in silent prayer before she began to read.

The invalid was greatly tickled with this little preliminary prayer, and
would have laughed aloud if he had not been too weak to do so.  As time
went on, however, he became interested in the Gospel narratives in spite
of himself, and he began to experience some sort of relish for the
evening reading--chiefly because, as he carefully explained to Elspie,
"the droning o' the old wumman's voice" sent him to sleep.

Meanwhile the other invalid--Duncan senior--progressed as slowly as did
his son.  The nursing of him was undertaken chiefly by Jessie Davidson--
the sympathetic Jessie--who was established as an inmate of Ben Nevis
_pro tem_, for that very purpose.  She was ably seconded--during part of
each day--by Billie Sinclair, between whom and the old Highlander there
grew up at that time a strong friendship.  For many weeks poor old McKay
was confined to his bed, and then, when allowed to rise, he could only
walk across his room with the aid of the strong arm of his stalwart son
Fergus.  To sit at his open window and look out at his garden was his
principal amusement, and smoking a long clay pipe his chief solace.
Like Duncan junior, old Duncan was quite willing to hear the Bible read
to him now and then, by Jessie Davidson and more especially by Little
Bill; but the idea of deriving any real comfort from that book never for
a moment entered his head.

One day Elspie came to him and said:

"Daddy, Dan wants to see you to-day, if you feel well enough."

"Surely, my tear.  It iss not the first time he will be seein' me since
I got the stroke."

"He has brought you a present--something that he has made--which he
hopes will be useful to you."

"What is it, Elspie?"

"You shall see.  May I tell him to come in and bring it with him?"

"Surely, my tear.  Let him come in.  It iss always goot for sore eyes to
see himself--whatever."

Elspie went out.  A few minutes later there was heard in the passage a
strange rumbling sound.

"What in all the world iss that?" said the old man to Little Bill, who
happened to be his companion at the time.

"It sounds like wheels, I think," said Billie.

The door opened as he spoke, and Dan Davidson entered, pushing before
him an invalid chair of a kind that is familiar enough in the civilised
world, but which was utterly unknown at that time in those regions.

"Goot-mornin', Tan; what hev you got there?  Iss it a surprise you will
be givin' me?"

"It is a chair, sir, which will, I hope, add a good deal to your
comfort," said Dan.  "I made it myself, from the memory-model of one
which I once saw in the old country.  See, I will show you how it acts.
Push me along, Jessie."

Dan sat down in the chair as he spoke, and his sister Jessie, who
entered at the moment, pushed him all about the room with the greatest
ease.

"Well, well!" said the amused invalid.  "Ye are a clever man, Taniel.
It iss a goot contrivance, an' seems to me fery well made.  Could Little
Bill push it, think ye?  Go an' try, boy."

Little Bill found that he could push Dan in the chair as easily as
Jessie had done it.

"But that is not all," said Dan.  "See--now I will work the chair
myself."

So saying he laid his hands on the two large wheels at either side--
which, with a little wheel behind, supported the machine--and moved it
about the room, turned it round, and, in short, acted in a very
independent manner as to self-locomotion.

"Well, now, that _iss_ goot," exclaimed the pleased invalid.  "Let me
try it, Tan."

In his eagerness the poor man, forgetting for a moment his helpless
condition, made an effort to rise, and would certainly have fallen off
the chair on which he was seated if Elspie had not sprung to his
assistance.

"Come, there's life in you yet!" said Dan as he assisted the old man
into the wheel-chair.  "Put your hands--so.  And when you want to turn
sharp round you've only to pull with one hand and push with--"

"Get along with you," interrupted the old man, facetiously giving the
chair a swing that caused all who stood around him to leap out of his
way: "will you hev the presumption to teach a man that knew how to scull
a boat before you wass born?  But, Taniel," he added, in a more serious
tone, "we must hev one like this made for poor Tuncan."

As this was the first reference which McKay had made to his younger son
since his illness--with the exception of the daily inquiry as to his
health--it was hailed as an evidence that a change for the better was
taking place in the old man's mind.  For up to that period no one had
received any encouragement to speak of, or enter into conversation
about, Duncan junior.

"You are right," returned Dan.  "I have been thinking of that, and have
even laid in the wood to make a similar chair for him.  But I fear he
won't be able to use it for some time to come.  Elspie was thinking, if
you don't object, to have your bedroom changed to one of the rooms on
the ground floor, so that you could be wheeled into the garden when so
inclined."

"Yes, daddy," said Elspie, taking up the discourse; "we can put you into
the room that corresponds with Duncan's room at the other end of the
house, so that you and he will be able to meet after your long illness.
But there is another contrivance which Dan has been making for us--not
for you, but for Old Peg.  Tell daddy about it, Dan."

"Like the chair," said Dan, "it is no novelty, except in this
out-o'-the-way place.  You see, I have noticed that Old Peg is rather
deaf--"

"Well, Tan," interrupted old McKay with a benignant smile, "it iss not
much observation that you will be requirin' to see that!"

"Just so.  Well, I also observed that it gives Duncan some trouble to
speak loud enough to her.  So I have invented a sort of ear-trumpet--a
tin pipe with an ear-piece at one end and a mouth-piece at the other,
which I hope may make things easier."

"Hev ye not tried it yet?" asked McKay.

"Not yet.  I've only just brought it."

"Go down, lad, an' try it at wanse, an' let me know what the upshot
iss."

Down they all went accordingly, leaving Duncan senior alone.

They found Old Peg in the act of administering beef-tea refreshment--or
something of that sort--to the invalid.  Peter Davidson and Archie
Sinclair were there also, paying him a visit.

"Hallo, Little Bill!" said Archie as his brother entered.  "You here!  I
guessed as much.  Your passion for nursing since you attended Dan is
outrageous.  You do more nursing in this house, I do believe, than
Elspie and Jessie and Old Peg put together.  What d'ee mean by it, Bill?
I get no good of you at all now!"

"I like it, Archie, and I'm training myself to nurse you when you get
ill or old!"

"Thank 'ee for nothin', Little Bill, for I don't mean to become either
ill or old for some time to come; but, I say, are they goin' to perform
an operation on Old Peg's head?"

This was said in consequence of Elspie shouting to the old woman to let
her put something into her ear to cure deafness.

"Cure deafness!" she exclaimed, with a faint laugh, "nothin' will ever
cure _my_ deafness.  But I can trust _you_, dearie, so do what you
please."

"Shut your eyes, then."

"And open your mouth!" said Archie to Little Bill in a low voice.

Old Peg did as she was bid.  Dan, approaching behind her, put the small
end of the tube into her right ear--which was the best one--and Elspie,
putting her mouth to the other end, spoke to her in her soft, natural
voice.

The effect was amusing.  Old Peg dropped into her chair as if paralysed,
and gazed from one to another in mute amazement.

"Eh! dearie.  Did I ever think to hear the sweet low voice o' Elspie
like as it was when she was a bairn!  Most amazin'!" she said.  "Let me
hear't again."

The operation was repeated, and it was finally found that, by means of
this extemporised ear-trumpet, the poor creature once more became a
conversable member of society.  She went about the house the remainder
of that day in a quite excited state, asking questions of everybody, and
putting the end of the instrument to their mouths for an answer.  Archie
even declared that he had caught her alone in the back-kitchen shoving
the cat's head into the mouth-piece of the instrument, and pinching its
tail to make it mew.

It was two days after the occurrence of these incidents that the old
woman was seated by Duncan's bedside, gazing through her tortoise-shell
glasses at the well-thumbed Bible, when her patient, who had been very
restless, looked up and spoke.

"Can I do anything for ye, dearie?" said Old Peg, putting the
trumpet-end into her ear, and handing the mouth-piece to Duncan.

"You--you hear much better now, Old Peg?" said the sick man, in his
natural voice.

"Ay, much, much better; thanks to the Lord--and to Mr Daniel."

"If Daniel had not thought of it," said the invalid, quite gravely, "do
you think that the Lord would hev sent the machine to you?"

"He might or He might not," returned the old woman, promptly.  "It's not
for me to say, nor yet to guess on that point.  But this I do know for
certain--if the Lord hadna' thought upon Mr Daniel, then Mr Daniel
wouldna' have been here to think upon _me_."

Duncan made no reply, and for some time remained quite silent.  Then he
spoke again.

"Peg, what wass it that you would be reading to me last night--something
about a malefactor, I'm thinking."

"Ay, it was about the robbers that was crucified on each side o' the
Lord.  One o' them reviled the Lord as he was hangin' there, the other
found forgiveness, for he was led to see what a lost sinner he was, and
repented and confessed his sins."

"That is fery strange," said Duncan, after a few moments' thought.  "Do
you think, Peg, that the robber that was forgiven wass a--a murderer?"

"I have little doubt o't," answered Peg, "for I've heard say that they
think very little o' human life in them Eastern countries.  But whatever
he was, the blood of Jesus Christ was able to cleanse him."

"Ay, but if he was a murderer, Peg, he did not _deserve_ to be
forgiven."

"My bairn," said the old woman, with something of motherly tenderness in
her tone, "it's not them that _deserve_ to be forgiven that _are_
forgiven, but them that see that they _don't_ deserve it.  Didna' this
robber say that he was sufferin' for his sins justly?  That, surely,
meant that he deserved what he was getting, an' how is it possible to
deserve both condemnation an' forgiveness at the same time?  But he
believed that Jesus was a king--able and willing to save him though he
did _not_ deserve it, so he asked to be remembered, and he _was_
remembered.  But lie down now, bairn, an' rest: Ye are excitin'
yoursel', an' that's bad for ye."

A week or so after the conversation above recorded, Dan brought a
wheel-chair for Duncan, similar to the one he had made for his father.
As Duncan had been getting out of bed for several days before, Dan found
him dressed and sitting up.  He therefore lifted him into the chair at
once, and wheeled him out into the garden, where a blaze of warm
sunshine seemed to put new life into the poor invalid.

It had been pre-arranged that old McKay should be brought down that same
day to his new room, and that he should also be wheeled into the garden,
so as to meet his son Duncan, without either of them being prepared for
the meeting.

"I don't feel at all sure that we are right in this arrangement," Elspie
had said; but Dan and Fergus, and Mrs Davidson and Jessie had thought
otherwise, so she was overruled.

Archie was deputed to attend upon Duncan junior, and Little Bill
obtained leave to push the chair of old McKay.  The younger man was
wheeled under the shade of a tree with his back to the house, and left
there.  Then the family retired out of the way, leaving Archie to attend
the invalid.

A few minutes after young Duncan had been placed, Little Bill pushed his
charge under the same tree, and, wheeling the chair quickly round,
brought father and son suddenly face to face.

The surprise was great on both sides, for each, recollecting only the
man that _had been_, could hardly believe in the reality of the ghost
that sat before him.

"Father!" exclaimed Duncan at last.

But the old man answered not.  Some strong feeling was evidently surging
within him, for his mouth was tightly pursed and his features worked
strangely.  Suddenly he burst into tears, but the weakness was
momentary.  With an effort that seemed to concentrate the accumulated
energy of all the McKays from Adam downwards, he again pursed his mouth
and looked at his younger son with a stern persistent frown, worthy of
the most rugged of Highlanders in his fiercest mood.

Duncan was inexpressibly touched.

"Father," said he again, "I've been a baad, baad son to _you_."

"Tuncan," retorted the old man, in a husky but firm voice, "I've been a
baad, baad father to you."

"Let us shake hands--whatever," said the son.

The two silently grasped each other's hands with all the little strength
that remained to them.  Then old McKay turned suddenly to his henchman.

"Little Bill," said he, in a tone that was not for an instant to be
disregarded, "shove me down to the futt of the garden--you _rascal_!"

With a promptitude little short of miraculous the Highlander was wheeled
away, and thus the momentous meeting was abruptly brought to a close.


CHAPTER THIRTY THREE.

MATRIMONIAL PLANS AND PROSPECTS.

Time passed by, as time is rather apt to do, and still the feud between
the rival fur companies continued, to the detriment of the Indians and
the fur-trade, the unsettling of Red River Settlement, and the
demoralisation more or less of all concerned.

Men who would gladly have devoted all their energies to the arts of
peace, became more or less belligerent in spirit, if not in act, and
many were forced to take sides in the controversy--some siding with the
Nor'-Westers and others with the Hudson's Bay Company.

With the merits of their contentions we do not propose to meddle.  We
confine ourselves to facts.

One important fact was that our hero Daniel Davidson took the side of
the Hudson's Bay Company.  Being a stout fellow, with a good brain, a
strong will, an independent spirit, and a capable tongue, he was highly
appreciated by the one side and considerably hated by the other,
insomuch that some of the violent spirits made dark suggestions as to
the propriety of putting him out of the way.  It is not easy, however,
or safe, to attempt to put a strong, resolute man out of the way, and
his enemies plotted for a considerable time in vain.

The unsettled state of the colony, and the frequent failure of the crops
had, as we have seen, exerted an evil influence for a long time on poor
Dan's matrimonial prospects, and at last, feeling that more settled
times might yet be in the remote future, and that, as regarded defence
and maintenance, it would be on the whole better both for Elspie and
himself that they should get married without delay, he resolved to take
the important step, and, as old McKay remarked, have it over.

"You see, Taniel," said the old man, when the subject was again
broached, "it iss of no use hangin' off an' on in this fashion.
Moreover, this nasty stiff leg o' mine is so long of getting well that
it may walk me off the face o' the earth altogether, an' I would not
like to leave Elspie till this matter iss settled.  Tuncan also iss a
little better just now, so what say you to have the weddin' the month
after next?  Mr Sutherland will be back from the Whitehorse Plains by
then, an' he can tie the knot tight enough--whatever.  Anyway, it iss
clear that if we wait for a munister o' the Auld Kirk, we will hev to
wait till doomsday.  What say you, Taniel?"

It need hardly be said that Dan had nothing whatever to say in objection
to this scheme.  It was therefore settled--under the proviso, of course,
that Elspie had no objection.  Dan went off at once to see Elspie, and
found that she had no objection, whereupon, after some conversation,
etcetera, with which we will not weary the reader, he sought out his
friend Fred Jenkins, to whom he communicated the good news, and treated
him to a good many unanswerable reasons why young people should not
delay marriage when there was any reasonable prospect of their getting
on comfortably in life together.

The sailor agreed with effusive heartiness to all that he said, and Dan
thought while he was speaking--orating--as one of the American settlers
would have expressed it--that Jenkins wore a peculiar expression on his
manly countenance.  Attributing it to unusual interest in the event, he
continued--

"Now, Fred, I want you to be my best-man--"

"Unpossible--quite unpossible," interrupted the seaman with a grave
shake of the head.

"How--impossible!"

"Ab-so-lutely unpossible."

"But why?  Explain yourself, Fred."

"'Cause it's only a bachelor as can be a best-man to a bachelor--ain't
it?"

"I believe so, though I'm no authority in such matters; but surely that
is a matter of no importance, for _you_ are a bachelor, you know."

"True, that's what I am to-day, but I won't be that long, for I am goin'
to be married next month, so I won't be available, d'ee see, the month
after."

"You--married!--to whom?" exclaimed Dan in amazement.

"Well, that's a point blank shot right between wind an' water.
Hows'ever, I suppose I can't go wrong in tellin' you, Dan, for it's all
settled, though not a soul knows about it except Little Bill, an'
yourself, an' her brother."

"But I _don't_ know about it yet," returned Dan.  "Who is it?"

"A angel--pure an' unmixed--come straight down from heaven a-purpus to
marry poor, unedicated, sea-farin' Fred Jenkins, an' her terrestrial
name is Elise Morel!"

Dan laughed while he congratulated the modest seaman, and admitted the
strength of his difficulty.

"D'you know, Fred, I've had a suspicion for some time past that you had
a leaning in that direction?"

"So have I, Dan, had an uncommon strong suspicion for a very long time
past, not only that I had a leanin' that way, but a regular list to
port, an' now I'm fairly over on my beam-ends!"

"But, surely, it must have come upon you very sudden at last," said Dan.
"How was it?"

"Sudden!  I should just think it did--like a white squall in the
Mediterranean, or a hurricane in the China seas.  This is how it was.
I'd bin cruisin' about her--off an' on--for a considerable time, tryin'
to make up my mind to go into action, an' screwin' my courage up to the
stickin' pint by recallin' all the fine sentiments that has carried
Jack-tars through fire an' smoke, shot and shell since the world
began--`England expects every man to do his dooty,'--`Never say
die,'--`Hookey Bunkum,' an' such like.  But it warn't no manner o' use,
for I'm an' outrageous coward wi' the gals, Dan.  So, in a sort o'
despair, I sailed away this very mornin' into the plantation at the futt
o' your garden, intendin' to cool myself an' think over it, when, who
should I see almost hull down on my lee bow but the enemy--Elise
herself!

"Well, I changed my course at once; bore straight down on her, an' soon
overhauled her, but the nearer I came the more did my courage run out,
so I gradooally begun to take in sail an drop astarn.  At last I got
savage, `You're a fool, Jenkins!' says I to myself.  `That's a fact!'
says su'thin' inside o' me.

"Now, if that su'thin' had kep' quiet, I do believe that I'd have gone
about-ship an' showed her my heels, but that su'thin', whatever it was,
set up my dander.  `Now then,' says I, `haul taut the main brace!  Up
wi' the t'gall'nt-s'ls an' sky-scrapers!  "England expects," etceterer!'

"Afore you could say Jack Robinson, I was along side--grapplin'-irons
hove into her riggin', and a broadside fired.  The way I gave it her
astonished even myself.  Nelson himself could scarce ha' done it better!
Well, she struck her colours at the first broadside, an' somehow--I
never could make out exactly how--we was sittin' on the stump of a tree
with her head on my rough unworthy buzzum.  Think o' that!  Dan, _her_
head--the head of a Angel!  Give us your flipper, mate."

"I congratulate you, Jenkins, with all my heart," said Dan, grasping the
seaman's flipper, and giving it a hearty shake.  "So now, I must look
out for another best-man.  Morel will do for me, I think, and you can
have my brother Peter, no doubt.  But could we not manage to have both
weddings on the same day?"

"Impossible," answered the seaman, promptly.  "Couldn't wait."

"But we might compromise the matter.  I might have mine a little sooner
and you could have yours a little later."

Still Jenkins shook his head.  "Not fair-play," he said.  "All the
advantage on your side.  However, we might consider it.  Hold a sort o'
drum-head court-martial over it, with Elise and Elspie as judges."

When the said court-marital--as Dan called it--was held, the compromise
was agreed to, and it was finally fixed that six weeks thereafter the
two couples should be united in Ben Nevis Hall.

But the current of these parallel streams of true love was not yet
destined to run smooth--as the next chapter will show.


CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.

A NEW DISASTER.

"I mean to go off to-morrow on a shooting trip to the lake," said Dan
Davidson to Archie Sinclair.  "I've had a long spell at farming
operations of late, and am tired of it.  The double wedding, you know,
comes off in six weeks.  So I want to have one more run in the
wilderness in all the freedom of bachelorhood.  Will you go with me?"

"`Unpossible,' as Jenkins would say," answered Archie.  "Nothing would
please me better, but, duty before pleasure!  I've promised to spend a
week along wi' Little Bill at the Whitehorse Plains.  Billie has taken a
great fancy to that chief o' the half-breeds, Cuthbert Grant, and we are
goin' to visit him.  I've no doubt that Little Bill would let me off,
but I won't be let off."

"Then I must ask Okematan to go with me," said Dan.

"You needn't trouble yourself, for I heard him say that he was goin' off
to see some o' his relations on important business--a great palaver o'
some sort--and Elise told me this morning that she saw him start
yesterday."

"Morel is too busy with his new farm to go," rejoined Dan, "and Jenkins
is too busy helping Morel.  Perhaps Dechamp or Bourassin may be more at
leisure.  I will go see."

But on search being made, neither Dechamp nor Bourassin was to be found,
and our hero was returning home with the intention of taking a small
hunting canoe and going off by himself, when he chanced to meet with La
Certe.

That worthy seemed unusually depressed, and returned Dan's greeting with
very little of his habitual cheerfulness.

"What's wrong with you, Francois?" asked Dan, anxiously.

"Domestic infelicity," answered La Certe, with a sorrowful shake of the
head.

"What! surely Slowfoot has not taken to being unkind to you?"

"O no!  Slowfoot could not be unkind, but she is unhappy; she has lost
her cheerful looks; she does not take everything as she once did; she
does not now let everything go anyhow with that cheerful resignation
which was once her delightful characteristic.  She no longer hands the
pipe of peace to our little one--indeed she refuses to let it have the
pipe at all, though the poor child cries for it, and comes to me
secretly, when Slowfoot is out of the way, to beg for a draw.  Then, she
scolds me--no, she does not scold.  Slowfoot cannot scold.  She is too
amiable--but she remonstrates, and that is worse than scolding, for it
enlists myself against myself.  O!  I am now miserable.  My days of
peace are gone!"

"This is all very sad, La Certe," said Dan, in a tone of sympathy.
"What does she remonstrate about?"

"About my laziness!  She does it very kindly, very gently--so like her
old self!--but she _does_ it.  She says, `Husband; we have gone on this
way too long.  We must change.  _You_ must change.  You are lazy!'"

"Well, La Certe," said Dan, "I'm afraid that Slowfoot is right."

"I know she is right!" retorted the half-breed, with more of
exasperation in his manner than his friend had ever before seen in him.
"When that which is said of one is false, one can afford to smile, but
when it is true what can one say?  Yet it is hard--very hard.  _You_ are
full of energy; you love to expend it, and you search for work.  It is
natural--and what is natural _must_ be right.  So, I am full of
laziness.  I love to indulge it, and I search for repose.  That is also
natural, and what is natural _must_ be right.  Voila!"

"Then I suppose your love for repose," returned Dan, "will oblige you to
decline an offer which I thought of making to you."

"What is that?"

"To go with me on a shooting expedition to Lake Winnipeg for a week or
two."

"O no!  I will not decline that," returned La Certe, brightening up.
"Shooting is not labour.  It is amusement, with labour sufficient to
make after-repose delightful.  And I will be glad to leave my home for a
time, for it is no longer the abode of felicity."

This having been satisfactorily arranged, preparations made, and
Slowfoot advised of her husband's intention, Dan went to Ben Nevis Hall
next morning to bid farewell to Elspie for a brief period.  He found
only old McKay in the Hall, Elspie having gone up the Settlement, or
down the Settlement--the man did not know which--to call on a friend.

"See that ye will not be long o' comin' back, Tan," he said.  "There
will be a good many arranchments to make, you see."

"I hope to be back in three weeks at latest," said Dan, "if all goes
well."

"Ay, if all goes well," repeated the old man, thoughtfully.  "As Elspie
says sometimes, `We never know what a day may bring furth.'  Well, well,
see that you will not be upsetting your canoe, for canoes are cranky
things--whatever."

In a short time our hero and La Certe found themselves floating once
more on the calm breast of the mighty inland sea.

It was afternoon.  The circumstances were eminently conducive to the
felicity which is derivable from repose, and thus admirably suited to
the tastes of La Certe.  An unruffled sheet of glassy water lay spread
out to the north-western horizon, which not only doubled the canoe and
its occupants, but reflected the golden glory of the sun, and mirrored
every fleecy cloudlet in the bright blue sky.  A mere dip of the paddles
now and then served to give impulse to the light, and literal, bark.
Genial warmth pervaded the atmosphere, and little white gulls floated
almost motionless on outspread wings, or sloped hither and thither with
lazy flap, while ever and anon the whistling wings of passing wild-fowl
gave promise of occupation to their guns, to say nothing of their
kettles.

On their third day out, towards evening, they went ashore on the
lee-side of a rocky point where some bushes and trees seemed to offer
firewood and shelter.

"This will do," said Dan, as he stepped lightly out on a shelving rock
and held the canoe while his companion took out the lading.  "Plenty dry
sticks and lots of moss for bedding."

"Truly, that is so," returned La Certe.  "It is a place in which
Slowfoot would rejoice to repose, and the little one to smoke its pipe."

"You forget," said Dan.  "The little one is no longer allowed that
luxury."

"No, I forgot not.  But I reflect that it is possible to give her many a
draw on the sly."

The fire was soon kindled, ducks were roasting in front of it, and the
kettle boiling above it.  The sweet companion continued calling him uncle
in the presence of the home. Only her voice took on when they were alone
loving tute.

To see him in bed approached him with the cup of steaming milk, I was
drinking with motherly pampering, you fix the bed smooth and
closed windows and doors carefully so they do not bother you a ray of
light. - Those nights in the cathedral!

- companion exclaimed with an expression of regret -. You're killing,
Gabriel: This is not for you. The father says the same thing.
Given that beyond death there is nothing we can not see us and
prolongs your life, let us take care of.

Now that we know and that I am blessed, it would be so sad to miss ...
the Gabriel off. That life could not last beyond the summer. Then I would
give something better.

Should not grieve, for such a small thing does not die. I live in the
same coughed Clavería that spending the night at the cathedral. After
lunch went to the cloister, completely replenished by the dream of
the morning.

It was the only time of day you could see his friends. Were close
to him or was Gabriel in his search, entering the house shoe or a climbing
tower. Yours, heard his words with the same attention as before, but
noticed there was a gesture of independence and at the same time
commiseration, as if admiring for having passed on their ideas, have
pity on her sweet nature, enemy of violence. - These birds - said Gabriel
talking to his brother - and fly on their own.

I need and want to be alone. _Vara Of palo_ meneaba The head sadly. - God
wants, Gabriel, that one day you regret not having spoken of
things that do not understand. Have changed much. Our nephew is not the
dogcatcher who suffer.

He says he left because he did not kill bulls get rich, kill men if
necessary to escape poverty, he has the right to any man, and that
all the rich are thieves ...

But brother, ¡por la Virgen!, You taught them these things really so
horrible? - Let - Gabriel said, laughing -. Have not yet digested new
ideas, and vomit nonsense. But that will happen. They are good
people.
That night, Dan and La Certe were fastened to a tree by cords which
allowed of their moving about freely within a small space, but their
arms were not unbound.  Here they were allowed to make themselves as
comfortable as possible in the circumstances.  Their bed, being mossy,
was well enough, but the distracted state of their minds--especially
Dan's--may be imagined.

"La Certe," said Dan, when the camp-fire had burned low, and the stars
were shining on them through the leaves, and all was still, save an
occasional snore from the Nor'-westers.

La Certe groaned in reply.

Poor Dan was not in a mood to comfort him or anybody else at that
moment, and did not follow up his remark.

"La Certe," he said again, after a quarter of an hour.

"Well?"

"Do you remember John Bourke?"

"Yes, yes.  I remember him, but I care not for him.  My own sorrows are
too great."

"Do you recollect," continued Dan, regardless of this despairing remark,
"that a good while ago the Nor'-westers took him prisoner, when he was
wounded after a skirmish with them, and carried him to Canada--treating
him with great barbarity on the way.  There he was put in jail, but, as
nothing could be proved against him, he was liberated, and then tried to
return to his family in Red River, but the Nor'-westers caught him
again, imprisoned him, sent him a second time to Canada, and had him
tried at the Court of the King's Bench, although his only crime was that
of resisting the North-West Company.  He was acquitted, and, after
terrible sufferings from which he never quite recovered and a three
years' absence, he rejoined his family in Red River."

"Yes, O yes!  I know it all," groaned La Certe.

"Well," continued Dan, bitterly, "his fate is not unlikely to be ours."

The poor half-breed made no reply to this.  For some time he lay quite
still, and his comrade had almost fallen into an uneasy slumber, when he
was awakened by La Certe breaking out into a soliloquy in which he
apostrophised his absent wife.

"O my Slowfoot!" he murmured.  "Shall we never meet again on earth?
Yes, you are right.  I have been lazy!  I _am_ lazy.  I suppose that
this is punishment for my sin.  But it is hard to bear, and very heavy--
is it not?--for only following one's nature in longing for repose.  O!
why was I born?  Why was our little one born, to enjoy for so brief a
time the delights of smoke, and then have it denied her--except on the
sly, when with her miserable father, who will never see her more--
perhaps."

He paused for a few minutes, and then broke out again.

"Yes, my Slowfoot--you are right.  I must reform.  I will cast off my
sloth as a garment--even--even though I should go naked all the rest of
my days!  I will work--energise!  I will--"

"Hold your tongue, La Certe, and listen," said Dan in a low, stern
voice.

"I am all attention," returned the poor man in a similarly low tone.

"Are you game to fight, if you get the chance?"

"Game to fight!" echoed the other--"to fight for my Slowfoot, my little
one, my smoke, and my repo--I mean my--my--new--"

"Speak lower, man, and listen to a plan I have in my head."

Here Dan spoke so low that he could not be heard at all, save only by
his companion; but that is of little consequence, for the plan, whatever
it might have been, was never carried out.

Next day the Nor'-west party with their two prisoners paddled away
towards the mouth of the grand turbulent Winnipeg River, and began to
traverse the weary wilderness-route of rivers and lakes, which at that
time formed the only direct means of communication between the frontiers
of Canada and "Rupert's Land."


CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.

THE LAST.

Eagerly, earnestly, doggedly, did Daniel Davidson and Francois La Certe
watch for a favourable opportunity to escape from their captors, but
they waited and watched in vain, for their captors were cruel, suspected
them of the intention to escape, and were consequently careful to
prevent even an attempt being made.  They never freed their wrists from
strong cords; kept knives and axes out of their way; tethered them to a
tree each night, and watched them continually.

Can it be wondered at that, in the circumstances, our unfortunate hero
became almost insane?  The wedding-day had been fixed before he left Red
River; preparations were being made for the great event, and it was
pretty well understood that Dan had gone off hunting with the view,
chiefly, to be out of people's way till the day should arrive.  They
would scarcely begin to notice his prolonged absence till the day
approached.  Then, no doubt, when too late, and he should be far on the
way to Canada, they would in some alarm send out parties to search for
him.

Dan became desperate, but he was gifted with an unusual power of
self-control, so that, beyond a very stern expression, his countenance
betrayed no sign of the terrible conflict that was raging within--a
conflict in which mortal hatred of mankind in general and an
overwhelming desire to kill or be killed formed elements.  Ah! reader,
poor human beings have many and many a time in the past been brought to
this terrible condition.  God grant that we and ours may never know what
it is to tremble on the brink of madness because of the combined
influence of gross injustice and horrible cruelty.  To do the
Nor'-westers justice, they were unaware of the intensity of the pain
they were inflicting.  They had only captured a powerful enemy, and
meant, by keeping a tight hold of him, to render him powerless in the
future--that was all!

As for La Certe, they had no intention of taking him to Canada.  They
only meant to carry him so far on the road, that, when set free, it
would be impossible for him to get back to the colony in time to give
effective warning to Dan's friends.

One afternoon the voyagers put ashore at one of the numerous portages
which obstruct the navigation of that route to Canada, and, after
unloading the canoe and lifting her out of the water, they proceeded to
carry the lading across to the still water above the rapids which
rendered this portage necessary.

Although bound, the prisoners were by no means freed from labour.  The
cords had been so arranged that they could use the paddle while in the
canoe; while, on the portages, although unable to load themselves, they
were quite able to carry a load which others placed on their shoulders.
On this occasion Dan was first sent off with a load, and then La Certe
and some of the others followed.  When he reached the upper end of the
portage, Dan flung down his load, and, from his elevated position, gazed
wistfully down the valley through which the waters of the Winnipeg River
roared and seethed among jagged rocks as far as the eye could reach.  It
was a wild majestic scene, but no thought of its grandeur touched the
mind of the poor prisoner.  He thought only of escape.  His intimate
knowledge, however, of the terrific power of rushing water told him that
there could be no escape in that direction.

"Oh! if my arms were only free, I would risk it!" he murmured, as he
raised his hands and looked at the powerful thongs of hide with which
they were bound--thongs which were always drawn tighter when he landed,
to render an attempt at escape more hopeless.  Should go down among the
crowd that filled the square, thinking no doubt that terror had
to get up before dawn to say Mass at the nuns. The palace was decorated
with garlands City Lights, which reverberate on the front the cathedral,
giving the stone a reddish glow of a fire. For seedlings between groups
of girls walking with flowers and white blouses, as if they were the
first appearance of the summer. The cadets were still in the hands of
the sword hilt, moving her slim waist and wide Turkish trousers. The
archbishop's palace was closed. Above the reddish glow of the square
covering a wide view of space, a summer sky, dark, limpid and deep,
tinged with bright dust of stars. When the music stopped and began to
turn off the lights, the people the cathedral felt somewhat lazy to leave
their seats.

They were right there. The night was warm, and they were accustomed to
seclusion and silence of Claverie, felt the joy of freedom that staying
in a balcony, with Toledo at his feet and the vastness of space
before your eyes. Sagrario, who had not left the upper cloister since
returned to the parental home, contemplating the sky with wonder.
- How many stars?

- muttered, as if soñase. - Tonight has increased - said the bell -. The
sky looks like a summer field of stars, which increases with the
proper harvest time. Gabriel laughed the simplicity of his companions.
They all admired to God, so careful and farsighted, who had made
the moon to the men lighting at night, and stars to darkness was
not absolute. - Then - asked Gabriel - Why no moon always, as did
the lighting for?

It was a long silence. All reflected on the question of Gabriel. The bell,
because they have more confidence with the teacher, he dared to ask
them what they thought. What was the weather, what was beyond that blue
...

The square had been deserted and in darkness. There was more light than
the diffuse glow of the stars scattered into space as gold dust. Of
the vast vault seemed to calm down a religious, an overwhelming majesty
that penetrate the soul of those people. Infinity starting to get
drunk with the tide of his greatness. - You - said Gabriel - have closed
their eyes to the immensity. You can not understand it. We have taught
the world a miserable origin and rudimentary, few imagined that the
Jews and ignorant rags in a corner of Asia, and written in a book has
been accepted until today. This personal God, like us in form and his
passions, is a giant carving craftsman who works six days and is
everything. The first day "creates the light and the room the sun and
stars. Whence came, then, if the light had still not seen the sun?
Is there a distinction between one and another ... It seems impossible
that such absurdities could have accepted for centuries. Listeners moved
his head in sign of assent.

The palpable absurdity they appeared, as always speaking Gabriel. If you
want to enter heaven - Luna continued - ye despojaros the human
concept of the distance.

The man measures everything by its size and dimensions conceived by the
scope of his eyes. This cathedral seems low because of its huge ships
are like ants, however, the cathedral, seen from afar, is a small wart,
compared to the piece of land we call Spain, is less than a grain
of sand, and Earth's surface, is an atom ... nothing. Our view as we
consider the dizzying heights that are thirty or forty meters.

At this time we believe to be very high because we are near the roof of
the cathedral, and all this is worth so little distance to infinity
as the indecision of the ant on a pebble to hesitate, not knowing how to
fall. Our view is short. We measure it by the meter, we can only
conceive of short distances, we have to make a great effort of imagination
to encompass the infinite.

Soon they were surrounded by the other voyageurs, who had left La Certe
to look after himself,--not caring much, in the excitement of the
moment, whether he escaped or not.

"He is dead," said one; "he breathes not; and see how his face is
bruised and cut."

"And his chest, too," said another.  "I think his ribs have been broken.
Poor fellow!  It was a wild, a reckless jump!"

"Keep back, and let him have air," said the chief, who was doing his
best, according to his knowledge, to resuscitate Dan.

Presently La Certe arrived, panting.

"O! he is gone!  My comrade, my friend, is dead!" he exclaimed,
clenching his hands, and gazing at the pale, bruised face.

"You are wrong," exclaimed the chief, testily.  "Out of the way, man!
See! his eyelids quiver."

And so they did; and so also quivered his lips, and then a sigh came--
faint and feeble--then stronger, and at last Dan opened his eyes and
thanked God that his life had been spared.  But when he recovered
sufficiently to realise his true position as being again a captive, the
feeling of despair returned.

That night they encamped a mile above the upper end of the portage.  At
supper the two prisoners were allowed to sit by the camp-fire and eat
with their hands free.

"Monsieur," said the guide to Dan, respectfully, "you see it is
impossible to escape.  Why compel us to bind you?  Give me your word of
honour that you will not try, and your limbs may then remain as free as
mine."

"I give you my word of honour," answered Dan, with a sardonic smile,
"that till after breakfast to-morrow I will not try, for I need rest and
food; but after that, I give you my word that I will never cease to
try."

With this promise the guide was fain to rest content, and that night Dan
and his friend were allowed to sleep untethered, which they did soundly.

Next morning they were roused in gentler tones than usual, and not
required to work--as had been the case hitherto--before breakfast.  In
short, there was an evident change in the feelings of their captors
towards them, founded largely, no doubt, on admiration of Dan's reckless
courage; but that did not induce them in the least degree to relax their
vigilance, for the moment the hour of truce had passed, the chief
advanced towards Dan with the thongs to bind him.

For one moment Dan felt an impulse to knock the man down, and then fight
the whole party until death should end the matter; but the good-humoured
look on his jailer's face, the fact that the man had saved his life the
day before, and the certainty of defeat with such odds against him,
induced him to quell the evil spirit and to hold out his hands.

"Pardon, Monsieur," said the chief, with the politeness of a French
half-breed.  "I am sorry you refuse to give me your parole.  I would
rather see you like the rest of us; but my orders are strict, and I must
obey."

Before Dan could reply, a sound struck on their ears, which caused the
whole party to listen, immovable and in perfect silence.

It was the wild, plaintive, beautiful song of the voyageur which had
floated to them on the morning air, softened by distance to a mere echo
of sweet sound.  After listening intently for a few moments, the guide
said gently: "Voyageurs."

Again they listened to the familiar sound, which increased in volume and
strength as it approached, proving that the voyageurs were descending
the river towards them.  As yet nothing could be seen, for a
thickly-wooded point intervened.  Presently the song burst on them in
full resonant chorus; at the same moment two large north-canoes--in all
the brilliancy of orange-coloured bark, painted bows and sterns,
red-bladed paddles, with crews of scarlet-capped or bare-headed men
swept round the point with quick stroke, in time to the rapid measure.

A cheer was the irrepressible impulse of the men on shore, causing the
newcomers to stop and listen.

"Perhaps," said Dan, "they may be your foes of the Hudson's Bay
Company."

"That may be so," returned the Nor'-west Chief, gravely.

The unfurling of an "H.B.C." (Hudson's Bay Company) flag proved that it
was so, to a certainty, and the depressed Nor'-westers did not cheer
again; but the H B C men came on, paddling with wild vigour and cheering
hilariously.

"They seem in great spirits," growled the Nor'-west leader.  "We are
almost as strong as they, boys, and have the advantage of woods and
cliffs.  Shall we fight and keep our prisoners?"

"What is that white thing in the bow of the first canoe?" said one of
the men.

"It looks like a flag," said another.

"If so, it is a flag of truce," observed Dan.  "They have something to
say, and do not want to fight."

"That may be trite, but we won't let _you_ be at the conference,"
returned the leader, sternly.  "Come, four of you, lead them out of
earshot.  Take your guns, and use them if need be."

Four powerful fellows at once obeyed the order, and led the prisoners,
who had been once more bound, into the woods.  Once again Dan was
tempted to offer fierce resistance, but he knew that the Hudson's Bay
men were yet too far off to be able to hear shouts--at least to
understand the meaning of them--and that it would be useless to resist
such a guard.  He therefore submitted to be led a mile or so into the
woods, and finally was permitted to sit down with La Certe under a tree
to await the result of the conference.

They had not to wait long.  In less than half-an-hour one of the younger
among the Nor'-westers came bounding towards them, waving his cap and
shouting.

"You are free, Messieurs--free!" he cried, seizing both prisoners by the
hands.  "We are no longer enemies!"

"Free!  What do you mean?" demanded Dan, who fancied that the young man
must have gone mad.

"The companies have joined!" he cried, excitedly.  "They are one!  We
are all friends now; but come and see and hear for yourself."

Filled with wonder, and some small degree of hope, Dan and La Certe
followed the young man, accompanied by their guards, who were not less
mystified than themselves.  Arrived at their camping-place, they found
that the canoes had brought a Chief Trader--or officer of the Hudson's
Bay Company--who was conveying to Red River, and the interior of
Rupert's Land generally, the good news of a momentous historical event,
namely, the union of the two companies.

The important event here referred to, namely, the coalition between the
two great rival companies, which took place in 1821, was the death-blow
to party strife over the whole of Rupert's Land, and also inaugurated
the dawn of lasting prosperity in the Red River Colony.

"Cut their bonds," said the Chief Trader, as the prisoners approached.

No touch of the surgeon's knife ever effected a cure more speedily.

"I congratulate you, young sir," said the Trader, grasping Dan's hand:
"you are now free, for I understand that your loss of liberty had
nothing to do with crime, and the rival companies are no longer
opponents; they are friends.  Indeed, we have been married, so to speak,
and are now one.  I am on my way to Red River with the good news."

"When do you start?" asked Dan, abruptly.

"Well, if you mean from this spot," answered the Trader, somewhat
surprised as well as amused at the eagerness of the question, "I start
at once.  Indeed, I would not have landed here had I not seen your
party.  You appear to be anxious.  Why do you ask?"

"Because it is of the utmost importance to me that I should be in Red
River on a certain date, and I fear that that is all but impossible
now."

Dan then explained, as briefly as possible, his circumstances.
Fortunately, the Trader was a sympathetic man.  He ordered his crews to
embark at once and bade the two captives take a brief, if not an
affectionate, farewell of their late captors.

"I cannot promise you to push on," he said, "at a rate which will
satisfy you--or even accomplish the end you have in view--but I will do
the best I can, without overworking my men.  I fear, however, that you
will have to make up your mind to a delayed wedding!"

"If you will only do your best for a day or two," said Dan, "until we
reach the mouth of this river, that will do, for there my own hunting
canoe was left; and, once in that, La Certe and I can go ahead and tell
them you are coming."

"Nay, that would be requiting me ill--returning evil for good--to take
the wind out of my sails and make my news stale," returned the Trader,
with a good-natured laugh.

"True, I did not think of that," said Dan.  "Then we will say not a word
about it until you arrive."

"Yes, we will be dumb," added La Certe.  "Even Slowfoot shall fail to
drag it out of me!"

And thus it was arranged.  The (late) Nor'-westers continued their
voyage to Canada, and the Hudson's Bay men resumed their descent of the
Winnipeg River.

Arrived at the great lake, the anxious pair did not wait even to rest,
but at once embarked in their little hunting canoe.

"I'm sorry you are such an unpresentable bridegroom," said the Trader,
when they were about to separate.  He referred to the cuts and bruises
with which poor Dan's countenance was temporarily disfigured.

"Never mind," returned our hero, with a laugh, "wait till you see the
bride; she will more than make up for the shortcomings of the groom.
Adieu!--_au revoir_!"  They pushed off, and now began a race against
time, which, in the matters at least of perseverance, persistency, hard
labour, and determination, beat all the records of bicyclists and
horsemen from the beginning of time.  Cyclists have frequent down-hills
to help and rest them; Dan and his friend had no such aids.  It was all
either dead level or upstream.  Dick Turpin and the rider to Ghent, (we
forget his name), only killed their horses.  Dan and Francois nearly
killed themselves--not only with hard work and no rest, but with
profound anxiety, for the wedding hour was rapidly approaching and they
were still far from home!

While these events were transpiring in the wilderness, things were going
smoothly enough in the Colony.

"I will be thinkin'," said old Duncan McKay, one fine evening as he sat
in his invalid chair, beside Duncan junior, who was woefully reduced and
careworn, despite the attentions of the sympathetic Jessie Davidson, who
was seated near him on a rustic seat beside Elspie--

"I will be thinkin' that Tan an' La Certe are stoppin' longer away than
iss altogither seemly.  Tan should have been here two or three days
before the weddin'."

"He will likely be time enough for his own weddin'--whatever," remarked
Duncan junior.  "Don't you think so, Miss Jessie?"

"I think it likely," answered the girl with a smile.

"He is _sure_ to be in time," said Elspie, with emphasis.

"We niver can be sure of anything in this world, my tear," remarked old
Duncan, becoming oracular in tone.  "How do you know he iss so sure?"

"Because Dan never breaks his word," returned Elspie, with an air of
decision that would have gratified Dan immensely had he been there to
see it.

"Fery true, my tear," rejoined the Highlander, "but there are many other
things that interfere with one's word besides the will.  He might tie,
you know, or be trowned, or his gun might burst and render him helpless
for life, if it did not kill him altogither.  It iss an uncertain world
at the best--whatever."

Archie Sinclair, who joined them--with his brother, Little Bill, by his
side, not on his back--was of the same opinion as Elspie, but Billie
shook his head, looked anxious, and said nothing--for he felt that his
friend was running things much too close.

At a later hour that same evening, the other members of the two
families--who dropped in to make inquiries--began to express anxiety,
and Okematan, who called just to see how things were getting on, shook
his head and looked owlish.  Old Peg said nothing, but she evidently
thought much, to judge from the deepening wrinkles on her forehead.

As for Fred Jenkins, he was too much taken up with Elise Morel to think
much about anything, but even he at last grew anxious, and when the
wedding morning finally dawned, and no Dan made his appearance,
something like consternation filled the hearts of all within the walls
of Ben Nevis Hall and Prairie Cottage.  Elspie appeared to feel less
than the others, but the truth was that she only controlled herself
better.

"He only wants to take us by surprise," she said, and, under the
strength of that opinion, she robed herself for the wedding.  Only her
gravity and the pallor of her cheeks told of uneasiness in her mind.

"Muster Sutherland said he would come soon after breakfast," observed
old Duncan, uneasily.  "He should hev been here now,--for we need his
advice sorely."

"Here he iss," exclaimed Fergus, starting up and hurrying forward to
welcome the good old Elder.

Mr Sutherland's advice was decided, and promptly given.  Both weddings
should be deferred and all the young men must turn out in an organised
search without a moment's delay!

It was amazing to find that every one had been of exactly the same
opinion for some time past, but no one had dared to suggest a course of
action which implied a belief that Dan might be in imminent danger, if
not worse.

Now that the ice had been broken, however, all the youth of the
neighbourhood volunteered for service, and a plan of search was being
hastily formed under the direction of the Elder, when two men in a canoe
were seen to paddle very slowly to the landing-place at the foot of the
garden.  The man was progressing in the same way as corporations. They
counted their evolution for centuries and humans for thousands of
years.

How to compare the man with the bipedal animal of prehistoric times,
carrying the still visible remains of the animals that had just shed,
living in fellowship with their grandparents monkeys without further
distinction as the first language and babble faltering spark that
started to burn in your brain?

starving the beast of the first, pursued by the cruelties of nature
and living in misery with fraternal lower animals, leaving the
man, who claimed sovereignty over the ascending dominating Nature.

Of man, which is still balancing the passions of the old animals with
the nascent development of thinking, came to be superior and perfect
by the philosophers dreamed, clean and attentive bestial selfishness
to turn into a period equal to the welfare life, cruel and troubled
by uncertainty.

Animality still dominant in man exasperated Gabriel.

Was faced with the obstacle generous plans for the future.

And out to his stunned listeners change the natural creation and
the origin of man: the great poem of the changes in nature, originating
from the protoplasm to the infinite varieties of life.

We were still in us the marks of origin. I had to laugh that the personal
God of the Jews, who had modeling clay man, like a statuary.

¡Unhappy artist! Noted in science and botch his carelessness, but he
could justify such omissions.

The hair of our bodies we are not served from the hair coat of animals:
why, then, create it?

Why give a male human nipples, if they can not serve for breastfeeding?

Why put the spine in the back of the body, as in quadrupeds, where
the logical thing, to "create" the man sustained on the feet, was
erected in the center axis of the body as strong, and avoid deviations
diseases of the spine which now suffers from this imbalance in
sustaining their weight?

Gabriel listed unexplained inconsistencies that were found in the
human body, assuming a divine origin. - I - I said - I am most
proud of my origin, be a descendant of historic inferior beings who
have come out of the hands of imperfect God clumsy.

I feel the same satisfaction that the noble about their ancestors,
when I think of our grandparents remotísimos men beasts, as all
animals subjected to the rigors of blind nature, and that gradually, over
hundreds of centuries, they become and succeed by developing their
spirit, their brains and their social instincts.

Create dresses, spiced food, weapons, tools and rooms neutralized
outside influences of Nature. What hero or discovered in the four thousand
years history which could be compared with those sketches of men
on earth slowly asserted the existence of our species, a thousand
times exposed to disappear ...?

The day when our prehistoric grandfather kept the sick and wounded,
instead of leaving, as all animals were doing, they planted the first
seed and threw the first arrow, Nature witnessed the biggest
revolutions. Only one other match in the future could be: if man
freedom in your body ages, we now lack the great revolution of the
spirit. Races to go further in their intellectual development to be so
alone, and cancel the other ladies will be on earth. The less
wise then it might be higher than the most cultivated minds of the
present.

Each individual will find his happiness in the happiness of this and
no one would dream of coercing the neighbor. There shall be no laws,
no penalties, and voluntary associations filled, the influence of
reason, the present charges of authoritarianism. This will be in the
future ... far, far away.
Her mother, being too stout
for active service, sat beside them and smiled universal benignity.  Her
little maid, Louise, chanced to be ill.  Peter Davidson's case, however,
was the worst.  He had gone off in company with Okematan to visit a camp
of Cree Indians, intending to be back in time, but his horse had gone
lame while yet far from home, and as it was impossible to procure
another at the time, he was fain to grin and bear it.  Meanwhile Antoine
Dechamp had been pressed into the service, and took his place as
best-man to Fred Jenkins--a position which he filled to admiration,
chiefly owing to the fact that he had never served in such a capacity
before.

Late on the following evening La Certe sat by his own fireside, somewhat
exhausted by the festivities of the day before, and glaring
affectionately at Slowfoot, who was stirring something in a pot over the
fire.  The little one--rapidly becoming a big one, and unquestionably by
that time a girl--crouched at her father's side, sound asleep, with her
head resting on his leg.  She no longer cried for a pull at her father's
pipe.

"Have you heard that Kateegoose is dead?" asked Slowfoot.

"No--how did he die?"

"He was met on the plains by enemies, killed, and scalped."

"That is sad--very sad," said La Certe.

"The world is well rid of him," observed Slowfoot; "he was a bad man."

"Yes," responded her lord; "it is necessary to get rid of a bad man
somehow--but--but it is sad--very sad--to kill and scalp him."

La Certe passed his fingers softly among the locks of his sleeping child
as if the fate of Kateegoose were suggestive!  Then, turning, as from a
painful subject, he asked--

"Does our little one never smoke now?"

"No--never."

"Does she never wish for it?"

"Slowfoot cannot tell what our little one wishes," was the reply, "but
she never gets it."

La Certe pondered for some time, and then asked--

"Does my Slowfoot still like _work_?"

"She likes it still--likes it better."

"And she _does_ it--sometimes?"

"Yes, often--always."

"Why?"

"Because Mr Sutherland advises me--and I like Mr Sutherland."

"Does my Slowfoot expect me to like work too, and to _do_ it?" asked La
Certe with a peculiar glance.

"We cannot like what we don't like, though we may do it," answered the
wife, drawing perilously near to the metaphysical, "but Slowfoot expects
nothing.  She waits.  My Francois is not a child.  He can judge of all
things for himself."

"That is true, my Slowfoot; and, do you know," he added, earnestly, "I
have had hard work--awfully hard work--killing work--since I have been
away, yet it has not killed me.  Perhaps you will doubt me when I tell
you that I, too, rather like it!"

"That is strange," said Slowfoot, with more of interest in her air than
she had shown for many a day.  "Why do you like it?"

"I think," returned the husband, slowly, "it is because I like Dan
Davidson.  I like him very much, and it was to please him that I began
to work hard, for, you know, he was very anxious to get home in time to
be at his own wedding.  So that made me work _hard_, and now I find that
hard work is not hard when we like people.  Is it not strange, my
Slowfoot?"

"Yes.  Your words are very like the words of Mr Sutherland to-day.  It
is very strange!"

Yet, after all, it was not so very strange, for this worthy couple had
only been led to the discovery of the old, well-known fact that--"Love
is the fulfilling of the law."

There was yet another of those whose fortunes we have followed thus far
who learned the same lesson.

About the same time that the events just described took place in Red
River, there assembled a large band of feathered and painted warriors in
a secluded coppice far out on the prairie.  They had met for a grave
palaver.  The subject they had been discussing was not war, but peace.
Several of the chiefs and braves had given their opinions, and now all
eyes were turned towards the spot where the great chief of all was
seated, with a white-man beside him.  That great chief was Okematan.
The Paleface was Peter Davidson.

Rising with the dignity that befitted his rank, Okematan, in a low but
telling voice, delivered himself, as follows:

"When Okematan left his people and went to live for a time in the
wigwams of the Palefaces, he wished to find out for himself what they
wanted in our land, and why they were not content to remain in their own
land.  The answer that was at first given to my questions seemed to me
good--a reply that might have even come from the wise heads of the Cree
Nation; but, after much palaver, I found that there was contradiction in
what the Palefaces said, so that I began to think they were fools and
knew not how to talk wisely.  A Cree never reasons foolishly--as you all
know well--or, if he does, we regard him as nobody--fit only to fight
and to die without any one caring much.  But as I lived longer with the
Palefaces I found that they were not all fools.  Some things they knew
and did well.  Other things they did ill and foolishly.  Then I was
puzzled, for I found that they did not all think alike, as we do, and
that some have good hearts as well as good heads.  Others have the heads
without the hearts, and some have the hearts without the heads--Waugh!"

"Waugh!" repeated the listening braves, to fill up the pause here, as it
were, with a note of approval.

"The Palefaces told me," continued Okematan with great deliberation, as
if about to make some astounding revelations, "that their land was too
small to hold them, and so they came away.  I told them that that was
wise; that Cree Indians would have done the same.  But then came the
puzzle, for they told me that there were vast tracts of land where they
lived with plenty of lakes, rivers, and mountains, in which there was
nobody--only fish and birds and deer.  Then I said, `You told me that
your land was too small to hold you; why did you not go and live on
these mountains, and fish and shoot and be happy?'  To this they
answered that those fine lands were claimed by a few great chiefs, who
kept them for their own shooting and fishing, and drove out all the
braves with their wives and families and little ones to crowd upon the
shores of the great salt-water lake, and live there on a few fish and
shells--for even there the great chiefs would not allow them to have all
the fishing, but kept the best of it for themselves!  Or, if they did
not like that, the poor braves were told to go and live in what they
called cities--where there are thousands of wigwams crowded together,
and even piled on the top of each other,--but I think the Palefaces were
telling lies when they said that--Waugh!"

Again there were many "Waughie" responses, mingled with numerous "Ho's!"
of astonishment, and a few other sounds that seemed to indicate
disbelief in Okematan's veracity.

"What," continued Okematan, with considerable vehemence, "what would my
braves do if Okematan and a few of the Cree chiefs were to take all the
lands of Red River, and all the buffalo, and all the birds and beasts to
themselves, and drive the braves with their families to the shores of
Lake Winnipeg, to live there on fish, or die, or leave the country if
they did not like it!  What would they do?"

Okematan's voice increased in fervour, and he put the finishing question
with an intensity that called forth a chorus of "Waughs!" and "Ho's!"
with a glittering of eyes, and a significant grasping of scalping-knives
and tomahawks that rendered further reply needless.

"Would you not scorn us," he continued, "scalp us, tear out our eyes,
roast us alive?--but no--the Cree Nation loves not cruelty.  The _Tato_
him know that insolent speech he had bought a knife and wanted to
premiere in the guts of any cure operator of the poor.

The niece complained to Don Antolín. Did not the case, the despised, and
no woman was not free to help in their work. The insolently replied
that he needed to be raised to pay. What I thought your uncle? It was
time to impose his authority to put a fist in the gentuza. But she,
a lively and vigorous in his house, had to withdraw bufando anger
or crying just peeked at the door. All women Clavería wanted revenge
on his former servitude and placed in the pending contempt. - Miradla
- shouted the shoe to its neighbors -.
They were very kind to me.  This is one of them."

The flashing eyes of the entire party were turned upon Peter Davidson,
who, however, had presence of mind enough to gaze at the cloudless
heavens with immovable solemnity and abstraction.

"There are two others, whom I look upon as sons.  One is named Arch-ee;
the other Leetil Beel.  Now," continued Okematan, after a pause, "my
advice is that we should teach the Paleface chiefs over the great salt
lake a lesson, by receiving the poor braves who have been driven away
from their own lands and treating them as brothers.  Our land is large.
There is room for all--and _our_ chiefs will never seize it.  Our hearts
are large; there is plenty of room there too.

"The Great Spirit who rules over all inclines my heart to go and dwell
with the Palefaces until I understand them better, and teach them some
of the wisdom of the Red-man.  I shall return to Red River to-morrow,
along with my Paleface brother whose name is Pee-ter, and while I am
away I counsel my braves and brothers to dwell and hunt and fish
together in love and peace."

Gabriel laughed listening to this story. - A man, believe me you, man
.... I wish it has a grip on the town, not like his predecessor,
that sopitas with milk, which he knew to pray and trembled before the
final canon.
Civilisation has made rapid and giant strides, especially during the
later years of the century.  The wave has rushed far and deep over the
old boundaries, and now the flourishing city of Winnipeg, with its
thousands of inhabitants, occupies the ground by the banks of the Red
River, on which, not many years ago, the old Fort Garry stood, a sort of
sentinel-outpost, guarding the solitudes of what was at that time
considered a remote part of the great wilderness of Rupert's Land.

THE END.
