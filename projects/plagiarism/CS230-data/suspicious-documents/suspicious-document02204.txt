    He saw there the dusty sheep
    Trotting blindly amidst the throng;
    The swine with quivering snouts,
    The boys who urged them with shouts,
    The hawkers of picture and song;

    The brown-skinned peasants trudging
    By their slow-paced bullock wains,
    With children asprawl the load,
    And wives who scolded and rode
    With an eye to their husbands' gains;

    The hooknosed Orient merchants,
    Who came in the caravans
    And bargained over the prices
    Of silks and carpets and spices,
    Pearls and feathers and fans;

    The clumsy sailors in ear-rings
    From the echoing harbour beach,
    With parrots and shells for their wares,
    The light of the sun in their stares,
    The sound of the wind in their speech.

    And the shrill-voiced changers of money
    Who sat with their clerks at the tables....
    And it seemed to him all no matter
    As he gazed ... like the evening chatter
    Of starlings under his gables.


    III

    And lo! hard by at a pillar
    Two learned Sophists disputed,
    Taking the turn of speech
    And disciples applauded each
    Or else each other confuted

    With babble and clenching of fist,
    And thrusting of face into face,
    And saying "Demus hath reason"
    Or "Lycas hath conquered. The season
    Of Demus hath passed, and his place

    "Is with us no longer." And mildly
    The grave-eyed Dreamer watched them
    Shouting and seething and ranting.
    But, when they perceived him, panting
    (For a sudden impulse snatched them)

    Ran up a crowd of both factions
    And cried, "Oh! Master, befriend us,
    For we all of us know thou art wisest,
    That thou speakest the truth and despisest
    No man and his need. Therefore lend us

    "Thy wisdom in this our dilemma."
    And the Dreamer answered, "I hear."
    So they told him with quibble and chatter....
    And it seemed to him all no matter
    Like the croaking of frogs in a mere.


    IV

    And behold! there ran thro' the market,
    Hard by where the Dreamer stood,
    A natural, void of desire
    Save for warmth of the sun or of fire
    Or for softness abed or food.

    Naught held he dearer in mind,
    Save the branchèd lightning veins;
    And in naught more strongly rejoiced
    Save the sound of the thunder deep-voiced
    Or the fertile flash of the rains

    Or the seas climbing into the harbour;
    And so thro' the market he ran
    Happy and careless and free
    (Him no man heeded for he
    Was a boy who would ne'er be a man)

    Munching the gift of a cake,
    A pilfered apple or fig,
    Or danced with his shadow awhile,
    Smiling a secret smile,
    Or twirled a hued whirligig.

    And the Dreamer called to him, "Come!"
    As he skipped in the sun with his Shadow.
    And the boy came doubtful and shy
    With a timid foot and eye,
    As a young horse comes in a meadow.

    And the Dreamer touched his cheek
    And murmured, "Be not afraid,"
    And the boy took heart and smiled,
    For the voice was tender and mild,
    And then half sadly it said,

    "Oh! ye who have called me the Master,
    The Teller of Truth, and the Wise,
    Oh! ye who have strayed in the dark
    Give ear to my saying and mark,
    For I give you a pearl of price,

    "A dark saying, and a hard saying
    To those who read it aright--
    This natural, whom ye see,
    Is wiser, Oh! blind ones, than ye,
    And thus have I learned in the night."


DIALOGUES.


    The Parting of Lancelot and Guinevere.

    (Mallory paraphrased.)


    "Be as be may," said Lancelot,
    "I go upon my quest."
    So mounted he and rode alone
    Eight days into the West.
    And to a nunnery came at last
    Hard by a forest ride,
    And walking in the cloister-shades
    Was by the Queen espied.
    And, when she saw him, swooned she thrice
    And said, when speak she might,
    "Ye marvel why I make this fare?
    'Tis truly for the sight
    Of yonder knight that standeth there,
    And so must ever be;
    Wherefore I pray you swiftly go
    And call him unto me."
    And to them all said Guinevere
    When Lancelot was brought
    "Fair ladies, thro' this man and me
    Hath all this war been wrought,
    And death of the most noblest knights
    Of whom we have record.
    And thro' the love we loved is slain
    My own most noble lord.
    Wherefor, Sir Lancelot, wit thou well,
    As thou dost wish my weal,
    That I am set in such a plight
    To get my dear soul heal.
    For sinners were the Saints in Heaven
    And trust I in God's grace
    To sit that day at Christ's right hand
    And see His Blessèd Face.
    Therefore I heartily require
    And do beseech thee sore
    For all the love betwixt us was
    To see my face no more.
    But bid thee now, on God's behalf,
    That thou my side forsake,
    And to thy kingdom turn again,
    And keep thy realm from wrake.
    My heart, as well it loved thee once,
    Serveth me not arights
    To see thee, sithen is destroyed
    The flower of kings and knights.
    Therefore now get thee to thy realm
    And take to thee a wife
    And live with her in joy and bliss,
    And pray God mend my life."
    "Nay, Madam," said Sir Lancelot,
    "That shall I never do,
    For I should never be so false
    Of that I promised you.
    But unto the same destiny
    As you I will me take,
    And cast me specially to pray
    For you, for Jesu's sake.
    In you I take record of God,
    Mine earthly joy I found,
    And had you willed had taken you
    To dwell on mine own ground.
    But sithen you are thus disposed
    And will the world forsake,
    Be now ensured that I likewise
    To penance will me take,
    And so, if haply I may find
    A hermit white or grey
    Who shall receive and shrive me clean,
    While lasteth life will pray.
    Wherefore I pray you kiss me now,
    And never then no mo."
    "Nay," said the Queen, "Oh! get thee gone,
    That can I never do."
    So parted they with wondrous dole
    And swooned for their great teen
    And to her chamber scarce on live
    Her ladies bare the Queen.
    But Lancelot woke at last and went
    And took his horse from keeping,
    And all that day and all that night
    Rode thro' a forest weeping.


    The Hermit and the Faun.


    A hermit knelt before his door
    Long-bearded, bald of head,
    When a laughing faun peeped thro' the brake
    And these the words he said,
    "My mother was a water-nymph
    And in these woods I grew,
    The faun, Amyntas, is my name,
    To what name answer you?
    How came you to this lonely hut,
    Why kneel you in the dust,
    With scalp as bald as a beggar's bowl
    And beard as red as rust?
    Why make you with those knotted claws
    Your gestures strange and sad?
    The sheep-bells tinkle from the plain,
    The forest paths are glad."

    "Oh! creature of the wood and wild
    You may not know my name,
    It was forgotten long ago
    For it was one of shame.
    Therefore I made a vow to dwell
    Upon this forest brink
    And take the ripened nuts for food
    And catch the rain for drink,
    To scrape wild honey from the rocks
    And make my bed on leaves
    Because of the hot sins of my youth
    Whereat my spirit grieves."

    "Not such as you, Oh! ancient man,
    Our joyous Satyrs here:
    Old men are they all laughter-mad
    Who wallow in good cheer.
    Amid lush grasses soft and cool
    They make their feasting ground,
    With smilax and with bryony
    Their rosy pates are crowned.
    You see them thro' the forest trunks
    Great rolling gladsome shapes,
    Who prop themselves on skins of wine
    By purple piles of grapes.
    Their huge brown bellies quake with mirth,
    Their ancient eyes are bright,
    And there they sit and roar old tales
    Far, far into the night.
    Then tipsy with the heady juice
    Each falls into a heap,
    Till white-horned morning bids him wake
    With all the land from sleep."

    "Oft lying in this lonely hut
    On panting summer nights
    I watched the stars like silver lamps
    Hung from those purple heights,
    And heard the forest-depths behind
    Fill with disquieting noise
    Like frightened cries of flying girls
    And shouts of eager boys,
    And saw white shapes go flitting past
    Like runners in a race
    And caught faint murmurs, sighs and laughs
    From all the forest place.
    And oft a distant sound of shouts
    Came with the soft night airs,
    And I ... lest evil might befall
    Got swiftly to my prayers."

    "And tell me now, Oh! ancient man,
    The God to whom you pray,
    These woods know none but mighty Pan
    Whom all our folk obey.
    His altar stands by yonder plane
    And there the shepherds bring,
    Toiling up from the fields below,
    Each day an offering,
    A lamb or else a yearling kid,
    A bud-horned lusty fellow,
    Great cheeses, grapes, or bursting figs,
    Or apples red and yellow,
    Or melons ripened in the sun
    A foot from end to end.
    Such gifts the shepherds bring to Pan
    That he may be their friend.

    "He is our Father, Lord of all,
    From the meadow to the Pass,
    So ... pray you to a painted bird,
    Or green snake in the grass?"

    "Rash Thing, beware," the Hermit cried,
    Like agates were his eyes,
    "The God I serve you do not know
    A strong God, just and wise.
    For He will purge your streams and woods,
    And smite both hip and thigh
    Your Satyrs, amorous bestial sots,
    Your careless company
    Who wanton in the thymy ways
    In which these woods abound,
    And kiss with soft empurpled mouths,
    Luxuriantly crowned.
    My soul is filled with prophecy;
    Dimly I see a bark
    Which runs by some low wooded isle;
    The night is warm and dark,
    And from a promontory rings
    A sudden bitter cry,
    It smites the lonely helmsman's ears
    And tingles in the sky.
    'Oh! Traveller, tell in every land
    These tidings strange and dread,
    Let all the peoples wail and weep,
    For Pan, great Pan, is dead.'"

    Amyntas pursed his pouting lips
    And shook his curly head,
    "Farewell, old man, the forest calls;
    I like you not," he said.
    "Your flesh is dried, your ribs are lean,
    You are too lank and sere,
    Your voice is harsh, your words are grim
    And do not please mine ear.
    The great god Pan is all I need
    And all I wish to know,
    My Father Pan, the shepherd's god,
    And now, old man, I go."

    Behind him closed a greening brake,
    And, after many a hail,
    He joined his gay companions
    And gambolled in a vale.


    Love's Defiance.


    "Light of my life lie close
    Oh! Love, I have found you at last;
    Let me hear your low sweet voice
    The knell of the aching past.
    The lashes lie on your cheek
    Oh! lift them and show me your eyes;
    Twin stars in a mortal face,
    They are soft, they are kind, they are wise."

    "Heart of my hungry heart
    My hero whose hand is in mine
    If we fall let it be to the pit,
    For to-day we have touched the divine.
    Time has stood still to-day....
    This day which has squandered its sun.
    It has been all glory and gold
    All perfect days in this one."

    "Light of my life, my love,
    My lady of dreams, lie near,
    The evening sighs thro' the pines,
    Hark! do you feel no fear?
    The light of love flashes out....
    Oh! wonder so old and so new--
    I am strong with the strength of that name,
    Dear, when I look at you."

    "Heart of my beating heart,
    My friend whose forehead I kiss
    In the days which were not days,
    Weaker was I than this.
    In the years which the locust ate
    My spirit clove to the dust,
    But now--come fate--I am bold,
    I build on a higher trust."

    "Light of my life, my Queen,
    Let us quarrel no more with life--
    The tears--or the final truth--
    We are victors now in the strife.
    With its purer days of joy
    With its prison anguish too,
    All myself, and the past of myself,
    My darling, worship you."

    "Heart of my singing heart,
    My lover, my lord, all hail!
    Fear shall be underfoot,
    I feel that we shall not fail.
    In the shadowy land we leave
    The grim wolves raven and bark,
    But our hearts are steadfast at length
    And our faces turn from the dark."


    The Playmates.


    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my Mary, oh!
    You looked so bonny then.
    Will you no give me your little hand,
    The sweetest hand I ken?"

    "Oh! I will give you my little hand,
    I'm sweir to say you no,
    Oh! I'll now give you my hands both
    My friendship for to show."

    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my lassie dear,
    The tears stand in these eyne.
    Will you no give me a kind word
    For the sake of old lang syne?"

    "Oh! I will give you a kind word
    Tho' I have little skill,
    For the time that we were children
    And played upon the hill."

    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my lass o' gold,
    Will you no give me a kiss?
    My heart, I think, is like to break
    If you refuse me this."

    "Alas! and if I must refuse
    You will not think me bad.
    That your heart should break for my sake,
    In truth it makes me sad."

    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my lassie oh!
    I will be true as steel.
    Will you no give me your promised word
    For the love that I do feel?"

    "Indeed--indeed--I like you well
    Aye, better than my brother,
    But I canna give you my promised word
    For--I must wait for another."


DRAMAS.


    June and November.


    On a day, long ago, I was just a child,
    I walked with my lover, my arm in his arm,
    Half of me was sad and half with joy was wild,
    The wind was so soft and the sun was so warm.
    I walked with my lover to his pretty nonsense listening,
    And I pressed my beating heart against my lover's side;
    And tho' my voice was steady my traitor eyes were glistening,
    I showed to my lover all I wished to hide.
    His vows were so tender, his speech was so fluent,
    He whispered his sorrow if ever we must part.
    My heart in my bosom fluttered and played truant,
    So I gave it him all ... my innocent heart.
    On a green bank amidst the purple irises,
    And the shadow of a pine-wood across it was flung,
    I gave him soft words, I gave him my kisses,
    I gave him myself--myself that was so young.
    On a day, long ago, (pity to remember
    How the wind was soft, how the sun was warm,)--
    Then it was June and now it is November,
    Then I knew no evil nor thought of any harm.


    A Foolish Tragedy.


    In the capital of Valladolid
    There lived a highborn maiden
    In a white house in a steep street
    With green doors and shutters,
    Her lips were like scarlet poppies
    And her hair like a black waterfall,
    And behind her ear she wore
    A flower of red geranium.

    And her Spanish lover sighed
    And in his love he cried,
    "Heaven were nearer
    If she were dearer,
    She is the most wonderful and beautiful thing
    In the capital of Valladolid.

    "If I could persuade her father,
    That fierce and rich old Councillor,
    Not to despise my suit
    But let me speak to his daughter,
    I would esteem it more
    Than the rank of a Grandee of Spain,
    A cargo of spices from Java
    Or a galleon laden with silver."
