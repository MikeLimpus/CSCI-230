_I have not much to say of this Poem, before I leave it to the_ Mercy _of
the Reader. There's no need of looking far into it, to find out that the
direct_ Design _of a great part of it, is to Serve the_ Cause of Religion
_and_ Virtue; _tho' 'twas necessary for that End to dispose the_ whole _in
such a manner as might be agreeable to the_ Tast _of the present Age, and
of those who usually give such sort of Books the_ Reading. _If there be
any Thoughts in it relating to_ Poetry, _that either are not known to_ all
Persons, _or are tolerably_ ranged _and_ expressed, _the Reader is welcome
to 'em for_ Over-weight: _If there are too few of these, I yet hope the
Pardon of all_ candid Judges, _because I've done the best I cou'd on this_
Argument. _I can't be angry with any Person for ranking me amongst the_
Ogylbys; _my Quarrel is with these that rank themselves amongst_ Atheists,
_and impudently defend and propagate that_ ridiculous _Opinion of the_
Eternity of the World, _and a fatal_ invincible Chain of Things, _which,
it seems, is now most commonly made use of to destroy the_ Faith, _as our_
lewd Plays _are to corrupt the_ Morals _of the_ Nation: _An Opinion, big
with more_ Absurdities _than_ Transubstantiation _it self, and of far
more_ fatal Consequence, _if receiv'd and believ'd: For besides its
extremely weakening, if not destroying, the_ Belief _of the_ Being _and_
Providence of God, _it utterly takes away any sort of_ Freedom _in_ Humane
Actions, _reduces Mankind beneath the_ Brute Creation; _perfectly_ excuses
_the greatest_ Villanies _in_ this World, _and entirely vacates all_
Retribution _hereafter. One wou'd wonder with what Face or Conscience such
a_ Sett _of Men shou'd hope to be treated by the Rules of_ Civility, _when
they themselves break through those of_ Society, _and_ common Humanity:
_How they can expect any fairer_ Quarter _than_ Wolves _or_ Tygers; _or
what Reason they can give why a_ Price _should not be sett upon their_
Heads, _as well as on the_ Others; _or at least why they should not be
securely_ hamper'd _and_ muzzled, _and led about for a_ Sight, _like
other_ Monsters. _'Tis the fatal and spreading_ Poyson _of these Mens_
Examples _and_ Principles _which has extorted these_ warm Expressions
_from me; I cannot with_ Patience _see my_ Countrey ruin'd _by the
prodigious increase of_ Infidelity _and_ Immorality, _nor forbear crying
out with some_ Vehemence, _when I am giving Warning to all honest Men to
stand up in the_ Defence _of it, when it is in greater and more eminent
danger than it wou'd have been formerly, if the_ Spanish Armada _had made
a Descent amongst us: I don't speak of these things by distant_ Hear-say,
_or only from our publick_ Prints, _but from my own_ Knowledg _and little_
Acquaintance _in the World, and therefore others must have observ'd much
more, and cannot but fear, that if things go on as they now are, without a
greater_ Check, _and more_ severe Laws _against these wide and contagious_
Mischiefs, _at least without a more general united_ Endeavour _to put
those Laws already made in_ strict Execution, _we are in a fair way to
become a_ Nation of Atheists. _'Tis now no difficult matter to meet with
those who pretend to be_ lewd _upon_ Principles; _They'll talk very_
gravely, _look as if they were in earnest, and come_ sobrii ad perdendam
Rempublicam: _they wou'd be_ Criticks _too, and_ Philosophers: _They
attack_ Religion _in_ Form _and batter it from every_ Quarter; _they wou'd
turn the very_ Scriptures _against themselves, and labour hard to remove
a_ Supreme Being _out of the World; or if they do vouchsafe him any_ room
_in it, 'tis only that they may find_ Fault _with his_ Works, _which they
think, with that_ Blasphemer _of old, might have been much better order'd,
had they themselves stood by and directed the_ Architect. "When merchant,
banker, broker, shake In Crockford's club their elbow, And for St. James's
clock forsake The chiming of thy bell, Bow:
When Batson's, Garraway's, and John's, At night show empty boxes,
While cits are playing dice with dons, Or ogling opera doxies; Then
Gog shall start, and Magog shall Tremble upon his pedestal."

  "When city dames give routs and reels, And ape high-titled prancers,
When City misses dance quadrilles, Or waltz with whisker'd Lancers;
When City gold is quickly spent In trinkets, feasts, and raiment,
And none suspend their merriment Until they all stop payment, Then
Gog shall start, and Magog shall Tremble upon his pedestal."

I was reflecting what dire calamities would fall upon the doomed City,
since the era of luxury, corruption, and desertion, thus denounced, had
now manifestly arrived, and Gog and Magog were actually starting and
trembling upon their pedestals, when the hall-keeper, shaking me by the
shoulder, exclaimed--"Come, Sir, you musn't be sleeping here all
night!
Bundle out, if you please, for I am just going to shut the great gates!"--_New

THE GATHERER.

A snapper up of unconsidered trifles.--SHAKSPEARE.

MODERN SALAMANDER.

An experiment to ascertain the degree of heat it is possible for a man
to bear, was made a few days ago at the New Tivoli, at Paris, in the
presence of a company of about 200 persons. The man on whom this experiment
was made is a Spaniard of Andalusia, named Martenez, aged 43.
A cylindrical oven, constructed in the shape of a dome, had been heated for
four hours, by a very powerful fire. At ten minutes past eight, the
Spaniard, having on large pantaloons of red flannel, a thick cloak also
of flannel, and a large felt, after the fashion of straw hats, went
into the oven, where he remained, seated on a foot-stool, during fourteen
minutes, exposed to a heat of from 45 to 50 degrees, of a metallic thermometer,
the gradation of which did not go higher than 50. He sang a Spanish
song while a fowl was roasted by his side. At his coming out of the oven,
the physicians found that his pulse beat 134 pulsations a minute, though
it was but 72 at his going in, The oven being healed anew for a second
experiment, the Spaniard re-entered and seated himself in the same
attitude; at three quarters past eight, ate the fowl, and drank a bottle
of wine to the health of the spectators. At coming out his pulse was
176, and the thermometer indicated a heat of 110 degrees of Reaumur.
Finally, for the third and last experiment, which almost immediately
followed the second, he was stretched on a plank, surrounded with lighted
candles, and thus put into the oven, the mouth of which was closed this
time. He was there nearly five minutes, when all the spectators cried
out, "Enough, enough," and anxiously hastened to take him out.

  A noxious and suffocating vapour of tallow filled the inside of the
oven, and all the candles were extinguished and melted.

  The Spaniard, whose pulse was 200 at coming out of this gulf of
heat, immediately threw himself into a cold bath, and in two or
three minutes after was on his feet safe and sound.

WILL

HICKINGTON,

_Proved in the Deanery Court of York, 1772._
This is my last Will, I insist on it still, So sneer on and welcome
And e'en laugh your fill.

  I, William Hickington, Poet of Pocklington, Do
  give and bequeathe, As free as I breathe,
  To thee, Mary Jaram, The queen of my haram, My cash
  and cattle, With every chattel, To have and to hold, Come
    heat or come cold, Sans hindrance or strife,
  (Tho' thou art _not_ my wife,) As witness
  my hand, Just here as I stand, This 12th of July,
  In the year seventy ----

  REGENT'S PUNCH.
  
    The receipt for this "nectarious drink" is as
  follows:--Three bottles of champagne, a bottle
  of hock, a bottle of curaçoa, a quart of
  brandy, a pint of rum, two bottles of Madeira, two
  bottles of seltzer water, four pounds of bloom raisins, Seville oranges,
  lemons, white sugarcandy, and, instead of water,
  green tea. The whole to be highly iced.
  There's here no _Middle-State_, you must excel;
  _Wit_ has no _Half-way-House_ 'twixt _Heav'n_ and _Hell_
  _All cannot All things_, lest you mourn too late,
  Remember _Phaeton_'s unhappy _Fate_!
  Eager to guide the _Coursers_ of the _Day_,       }
  Beneath their _Brazen Hoofs_ he trampled lay,     }
  And his bright _Ruines_ mark'd their flaming Way. }                 30
                                                   [Sidenote: _Genius_.]
    You'll ask, What GENIUS is, and Where to find?
  'Tis the full _Power_ and _Energy_ of _Mind_:
  A _Reach_ of _Thought_ that skims all Nature o'er,
  _Exhausts_ this narrow _World_, and asks for _more_:
  Through every _Rank of Beings_ when't has flown,
  Can frame a _New Creation_ of its own:
  By _Possible_ and _Future_ unconfin'd:
  Can stubborn _Contradictions_ yoke, and bind
  Through _Fancy_'s Realms, with Number, Time and Place,
  _Chimera-Forms_, a thin, an airy Race;                              40
  Then with a secret _conscious Pride_ surveys
  The _Enchanted Castles_ which't had _Power_ to raise.
                                                      [Sidenote: _Wit_.]
    As _Genius_ is the _Strength_, be WIT defin'd
  The _Beauty_ and the _Harmony_ of _Mind_:
  _Beauty's_ Proportion, Air, each lively Grace
  The _Soul_ diffuses round the _Heav'nly Face_:
  'Tis _various_, yet 'tis _equal_, still the same
  In _Alpine Snows_, or _Ethiopian Flame_;
  While _glaring Colours_ short-liv'd Grace supply,
  Nor _Frost_ nor _Sun_ they bear, but _scorch_ and _die_.            50
                                                 [Sidenote: _Judgment_.]
    Nor these alone, tho much they can, suffice,
  JUDGMENT must join, or never hope the Prize:
  Those _Headstrong Coursers_ scowr along the Plains,
  The _Rider's_ down, if once he lose the _Reins_:
  Soon the _Mad Mixture_ will to all give Law,
  And for the _Laurel Wreaths_ present thee _Wreaths of Straw_.
  _Judgment's_ the _Act of Reason_; that which brings
  Fit _Thoughts_ to _Thoughts_, and argues _Things_ from _Things_,
  True, Decent, Just, are in its _Balance_ try'd,
  And thence we learn to _Range, Compound, Divide_.                   60
                                     [Sidenote: _Invention and Memory_.]
    A _Cave_ there is wherein those _Nymphs_ reside
  Who all the Realms of _Sense_ and _Fancy_ guide;
  Nay some affirm that in the deepest _Cell_
  Imperial _Reason's_ self does not disdain to dwell:
  With Living _Reed_ 'tis thatch'd and guarded round,
  Which mov'd by _Winds_ emit a Silver Sound:
  Two _Crystal Fountains_ near its _Entrance_ play,      }
  Wide scatt'ring _Golden Streams_ which ne'er decay,    }
  Two _Labyrinths_ behind harmonious Sounds convey:      }
  Chiefly, within, the _Room of State_ is fam'd                       70
  Of rich _Mosaick Work_ divinely fram'd:
  Of small _Extent_ to view, 'twill all things hide,
  Heav'n's Azure _Arch_ it self not half so wide:
  Here all the _Arts_ their sacred Mansion chuse,
  Here dwells the MOTHER of the Heav'n-born Muse:
  With wond'rous mystic _Figures_ round 'tis wrought
  _Inlaid_ with FANCY, and _anneal'd_ with _Thought_:
  With more than humane Skill depicted here
  The various _Images of Things_ appear;
  What _Was_, or _Is_, or labours yet to _Be_                         80
  Within the Womb of Dark _Futurity_,
  May _Stowage_ in this wondrous _Storehouse_ find,
  Yet leave unnumber'd empty _Cells_ behind:
  But ah! as fast they come, they fly too fast,
  Not _Life or Happiness are more in haste_:
  Only the _First Great Mind_ himself can stay
  The _Fugitives_ and at _one Glance_ survey;
  But those whom he disdains not to befriend,  }
  _Uncommon Souls_, who nearest Heav'n ascend  }
  Far more, at once, than others comprehend:   }                      90
  Whate'er within this _sacred Hall_ you find,    }
  Whate'er will _lodge_ in your _capacious Mind_  }
  Let _Judgment_ sort, and skilful _Method_ bind; }
  And as from these you draw your antient Store
  Daily supply the _Magazine_ with more.
  Furnish'd with such _Materials_ he'll excel
  Who when he _works_ is sure to work 'em _well_;
  This ART alone, as _Nature_ that bestows,
  And in _Perfection_ both, th' accomplish'd _Verser_ knows.
  Knows to _persuade_, and how to _speak_, and when;                 100
  The _Rules of Life_, and _Manners_ knows and _Men_:
  Those _narrow Lines_ which _Good_ and _Ill_ divide;
                                                 [Sidenote: _Learning_.]
  And by what _Balance Just_ and _Right_ are try'd:
  How _Kindred-Things_ with _Things_ are closely join'd; }
  How _Bodies_ act, and by what _Laws_ confin'd,         }
  Supported, mov'd and rul'd by th' _Universal Mind_.    }
  When the moist _Kids_ or burning _Sirius_ rise;  }
  Through what ambiguous Ways _Hyperion_ flies,    }
  And marks our _Upper_ or the _Nether Skies_.     }
  He knows those _Strings_ to _touch_ with artful Hand               110
  Which rule Mankind, and all the World command:
  What _moves_ the _Soul_, and every secret _Cell_
  Where _Pity, Love_, and all the _Passions_ dwell.
  The _Music_ of his _Verse_ can _Anger_ raise,
  Which with a softer _Stroak_ he _smooths_ and _lays_:
  Can _Emulation, Terror_, all excite,
  _Compress_ the _Soul_ with _Grief_, or _swell_ with vast Delight.
  If this you can, your _Care_ you'll well bestow,
  And some new _Milton_ or a _Spencer_ grow;
  If not, a _Poet_ ne'er expect to be,                               120
  Content to _Rime_, like _D----y_ or like me.
    But here perhaps you'll stop me, and complain,
  To such _Impracticable Heights_ I strain
  A Poet's _Notion_, that if _This_ be _He_,
  There ne'er was one, nor e'er is like to be.
  --But soft, my Friend! may we not _copy_ well
  Tho far th' _Original_ our _Art_ excel?
  _Divine Perfection_ we our _Pattern_ make
  Th' _Idea_ thence of _Goodness_ justly take;
  But they who _copy_ nearest, still must fall                       130
  Immensely short of their _Original_;
                                                 [Sidenote: _Converse_.]
    But _Wit_ and _Genius_, _Sense_ and _Learning_ join'd,
  Will all come short if _crude_ and _unrefin'd_;
  'Tis CONVERSE only melts the stubborn _Ore_
  And _polishes_ the _Gold_, too rough before:
  So _fierce_ the _Natural Taste_, 'twill ne'er b' endur'd,
  The _Wine_ is _strong_, but never rightly _cur'd_.
                                                    [Sidenote: _Style_.]
    STYLE is the _Dress_ of _Thought_; a _modest_ Dress,
  _Neat_, but not _gaudy_, will true _Critics_ please:
  Not _Fleckno's Drugget_, nor a worse Extream                       140
  All daub'd with _Point_ and _Gold_ at every Seam:
  Who only _Antique Words_ affects, appears
  Like old King _Harry's_ Court, all Face and Ears;
  Nor in a _Load_ of _Wig_ thy Visage shrowd,
  Like _Hairy Meteors glimm'ring through a Cloud_:
  Happy are those who here the _Medium_ know,
  We hate alike a _Sloven_ and a _Beau_.
  I would not follow _Fashion_ to the height
  Close at the _Heels_, not yet be _out of Sight_:
  _Words_ alter, like our _Garments_, every day,                     150
  Now _thrive_ and _bloom_, now _wither_ and _decay_.
  Let those of greater _Genius_ new _invent_,
  Be you with those in _Common Use_ content.
    A different _Style's_ for _Prose_ and _Verse_ requir'd,
  _Strong figures_ here, _Neat Plainness_ there desir'd:
  A different _Set of Words_ to both belong;
  What _shines_ in _Prose_, is, _flat_ and _mean_ in _Song_.
  The _Turn_, the _Numbers_ must be vary'd here,
  And all things in a _different Dress_ appear.
  This every _School Boy_ lash'd at _Eaton_ knows,  }                160
  Yet _Men of Sense_ forget when they _compose_,    }
  And Father DRYDEN's Lines are sometimes _Prose_.  }
  A _vary'd Stile_ do various Works require,
  This _soft_ as _Air_, and _tow'ring_ that as _Fire_.
  None than th' _Epistle_ goes more _humbly_ drest,
  Tho _neat_ 'twou'd be, and _decent_ as the _best_.
  Such as th' ingenious _Censor_ may invite     }
  Oft to return with eager _Appetite_;          }
  So HORACE wrote, and so I'd _wish_ to write.  }
  Nor _creeps_ it always, but can _mount_ and _rise_,                170
  And with _bold Pinions_ sail along the Skies.
  The self-same Work of _different Style_ admits,
  Now _soft_, now _loud_, as best the _Matter_ fits:
  So Father THAMES from unexhausted _Veins_,
  Moves _clean_ and _equable_ along the _Plains_;
  Yet still of different _Depth_ and _Breadth_ is found,
  And _humours_ still the _Nature_ of the _Ground_.
                                                  [Sidenote: _Reading_.]
    READING will mend your Style and raise it higher,
  And _Matter_ find to feed th' _Immortal Fire_:
  But if you would the _Vulgar Herd_ excel,                          180
  And justly gain the _Palm_ of _Writing well_,
  Wast not your Lamp in scanning _Vulgar Lines_,
  Where _groveling_ all, or _One in twenty_ shines;
  With _Prudence_ first among the _Antients_ chuse,
  The _noblest_ only, and the _best_ peruse;
  Such HOMER is, such VIRGIL's sacred Page,
  Which _Death_ defie, nor yield to _Time_ or _Age_;
  New _Beauties_ still their _Vigorous Works_ display,
  Their _Fruit_ still _mellows_, but can ne'er _decay_.
  The _Modern Pens_ not altogether slight,                           190
  Be _Master_ of your _Language_ e'er you write!
  _Immortal_ TILLOTSON with Judgment scan,
  "That _Man of Praise, that something more than Man_!"
  Ev'n those who hate his _Ashes_ this advise,         }
  As from black Shades resplendent Lightning flies,    }
  _Unwilling Truths_ break through a _Cloud of Lies_.  }
  He _Words_ and _Things_ for _mutual Aid_ design'd,
  Before at _Variance_, in just _Numbers_ join'd;
  He always _soars_, but never's _out of sight_,
  He taught us how to _Speak_, and _Think_, and _Write_.             200
    If _English Verse_ you'd in _Perfection_ see,
  ROSCOMMON read, and _Noble_ NORMANDY:
  We _borrow_ all from their _exhaustless Store_,
  Or little say they have not said _before_.
  _Poor Insects_ of a _Day_, we toil and strive
  To creep from _Dust_ to _Dust_, and think we _live_;
  These weak _imperfect Beings_ scarce enjoy
  E'er _Death's_ rude Hand our _blooming Hopes_ destroy:
  With _Lynx's_ Eyes each others _Faults_ we find,
  But to our _own_ how few who are not _blind_?                      210
  How _long is Art_, how _short_, alas! our _Time_!   }
  How few who can above the _Vulgar_ climb,           }
  Whose _stronger Genius_ reach the _True Sublime_!   }
  With _tedious Rules_ which we our selves transgress,
  We make the _Trouble more_ who strive to make it _less_.
    an act which I need not say was evidently
  symbolical of their desire to rend asunder the
  _Corn Laws_, and to divide the landed property
  amongst themselves. The action also appears analogous
  to the custom of breaking bread and swearing alliance on it, a practice
  still observed by the inhabitants of some remote
  regions of the Caucasus. I must again
  solemnly express my conviction that we are standing
  on a _slumbering_ VOLCANO; the thoughtless
  and unobservant may suppose not; probably because
  in the present tee-total state of society they
  see nothing of the CRATER.

  TAKING A SIGHT AT THE FIRE.
  
  A man bearing the very inapplicable name of
  _Virtue_ was brought up at Lambeth-street last
  week, on the charge of having stolen a telescope from the Ordnance-office
  in the Tower on the morning of the fire.
  The prisoner pleaded that, being short-sighted, he
  took the glass to have a sight of the fire. The
  magistrate, however, _saw through_ this excuse very clearly;
  and as it was apparent that _Virtue_ had taken a _glass_ too much on
  the occasion, he was fully committed.

  JOE HUME'S FORTHCOMING WORK.
  
  We have received the following note from an old
    and esteemed correspondent, who, we are
  rejoiced to find, has returned from a tour in
  Switzerland, where he has been engaged in a prodigious work connected
  with the statistics of that country.
  
  
  _Reform Club-house_.
  
  DEAR PUNCH,
  Knowing the interest you take in anything relating to the
  advancement of science, I beg to apprise you
  that I am about publishing a statistical work, in
    which I have made it perfectly clear that an immense saving in the
  article of ice alone might be made in England by
  importing that which lies waste upon Mont Blanc. I
  have also calculated to a fraction the number of pints
  of milk produced in the canton of Berne, distinguishing
  the quantity used in the making of cheese
  from that which has been consumed in the
  manufacture of butter--and specifying
  in every instance whether the milk has been yielded
  by cows or goats. There will be also a valuable appendix
  to the work, containing a correct list of all the inns on the road
    between Frankfort and Geneva, with a copy
  of the bill of fare at each, and the prices
  charged; together with the colour of the
  postilion's jacket, the age of the landlord and the
  weight of his wife, and the height in inches of the
  cook and chambermaid. To which will be
  added, "Ten Minutes' Advice" upon making one
  shilling go as far as two. If you can give me a
    three-halfpenny puff in your admired publication, you will
  confer a favour on
  Your sincere friend,
  JOE HUME.

  THE ROMANCE OF A TEACUP.
  
  
  SIP THE FIRST.
  
  In England one man's mated to one woman, To spend
  their days in holy matrimony-- In fact, I
  _have_ heard from one or two men, That one wife in a
  house is one too many-- But, be this as
  it may, in China no man Who can afford it shuts himself
  to any Fix'd number, but is variously
    encumber'd With better halves, from twenty to a
  hundred.
                                              
These to provide for in a pleasant way, And, maybe, to avoid their
chat and worry, He shuts up in a harem night and day-- With them
contriving all his cares to bury-- A point of policy which, I should
say, Sweetens the dose to men about to marry; For, though a wife's
a charming thing enough, Yet, like all other blessings, _quantum
suff_.
So to my tale: Te-pott the Multifarious Was, once upon a time, a
mandarin-- In personal appearance but precarious, Being incorrigibly
bald and thin-- But then so rich, through jobs and pensions various,
Obtain'd by voting with the party "in," That he maintain'd, in grace
and honour too, Sixty-five years, and spouses fifty-two.
Fifty-two wives! and still he went about Peering below the maiden
ladies' veils-- Indeed, it _was_ said (but there hangs a doubt Of
scandal on such gossip-whisper'd tales), He had a good one still
to single out-- For all his wives had tongues, and _some_ had nails--
And still he hoped, though fifty-twice deferr'd, To find an angel
in his fifty-third.
In China, mind, and such outlandish places, A gentleman who wishes
to be wed Looks round about among the pretty faces, Nor for a moment
doubts they may be had For asking; and if any of them "nay" says,
He has his remedy as soon as said-- For, when the bridegrooms
disapprove what they do, They teach them manners with the bastinado.No _Work_ attempt but where your _Strength_ you know,
  Be _Master of your Subject_, _Thoughts_ will _flow_:               300
  The _newer_ 'tis, the _choicer Fruit_ 'twill yield,
  More _Room_ you have to work if _large_ your _Field_;
  The _Sponge_ you oftner than the _Pen_ will want,
  And rather _Reason_ see to _prune_ than _plant_;
  Yet where the _Thoughts_ are _barren, weak_ and _thin_,
  New _Cyons_ should be neatly _grafted_ in.

  Your _Fancy's Offspring_ ne'er can want a _Test_,
  Tho _Both_, perhaps may _overshoot_ the _Mark_:
  First _Spite_ with _Envy_ charges in the _Dark_;                   310
  _Unread_ they _damn_, and into _Passion_ fall,
  'Tis _Stuff_, 'tis _Blasphemy_ 'tis _Nonsense_ all;
  They _sleep_ (when _doz'd before_) at every _Line_,       }
  While your more _dang'rous Friend_ exclaims,--'Tis fine,  }
  'Tis _furiously Delightful_, 'tis _Divine_;               }
  Th' _inspiring God's_ in ev'ry Page confess'd;
  A COWLEY or a DRYDEN at the least!
  Yet you'll from _both_ an _equal Judgment_ frame
  And stand the _nearest Candidate_ for _Fame_:
  What _Envy praises_, or what _Friends dislike_,                    320
  This bears the _Test_, and that the _Sponge_ should strike.
  Chuse to be _absent_ when your _Cause_ is try'd,
  Lest _Favour_ should the _partial Judge_ misguide;
  Not _others Thoughts_ implicitly prefer,
  Your _Friend's_ a _Mortal_, and like _you_, may _err_.
  Upon the _last Appeal_ let _Reason_ sit,
  And _here_, let _all Authority_ submit.
  Divest your _self of self_ whate'er you can,
  And think the _Author_ now some _other Man_.
  A thousand trivial _Lumber-Thoughts_ will come,                    330
  A thousand _Fagot-Lines_ will crowd for room;
  _Reform_ your _Troops_, and no _Exemption_ grant,
  You'll gain in _Strength_, what you in _Numbers_ want.
  Nor yet _Infallibility_ pretend;
  He still _errs on_ who thinks he ne'er can _mend_:
  Reject that _hasty_, that _presumptuous Thought_!
  None e'er but VIRGIL wrote without a _Fault_;
  (Or _none_ he has, or none that _I can find_,
  Who, dazzled with his _Beauties_, to his _Moles_ am blind.)
  Who has the _least_ is _happiest_, he the _best_,                  340
  Who _owns_ and _mends_ where he has once _transgrest_.
  Nor will _good Writers smaller Blots_ despise,
  Lest those neglected should to _Crimes_ arise;
  Such _Venial Sins_ indulg'd will _mortal_ prove,
  At least they from _Perfection_ far remove.
  Nor _Critical Exactness_ here deride,
  It looks like _Sloth_ or _Ignorance_, or _Pride_;
  _Good Sense_ is spoild in _Words unapt_ exprest,
  And _Beauty_ pleases more when 'tis _well drest_.
                                                   [Sidenote: _Method_.]
    Forget not METHOD if the _Prize_ you'd gain,                     350
  'Twill cost you _Thought_, but richly pays the _Pain_;
  What _first_, what _second_, or what _last_ to place,
  What here will _shine_, and there the _Work_ disgrace.
    Before you build, your MODEL justly lay,
  And ev'ry Part in _Miniature_ survey;
  Where airy _Terraces_ shall threat the _Skies_,
  Where _Columns_ tow'r, or neat _Pilasters_ rise;
  Where cool _Cascades_ come _roaring_ down the Hill,
  Or where the _Crystal Nymph_ a _mossie Bason_ fill:
  What _Statues_ are to grace the _Front_ design'd,                  360
  And how to throw the _meaner Rooms_ behind.
  Draw the _Main Strokes_ at first, 'twill shew your _Skill_,
  _Life-Touches_ you may add whene'er you will.
  Ev'n _Chance_ will sometimes all our _Art_ excel,
  The _angry Foam_ we ne'er can _hit_ so well.
  A _sudden Thought_, all beautiful and bright,
  Shoots in and _stunns_ us with _amazing Light_;
  Secure the _happy Moment_ e'er 'tis past,
  Not _Time_ more _swift_, or _Lightning_ flies so fast.
    All must be _free_ and _easie_, or in vain                       370
  You _whip_ and _spur_, and the _wing'd Courser_ strain:
  When _foggy Clouds_ hang _bellying_ in the _Skies_,
  Or _fleety Boreas_ through th' _Horizon_ flies;
  He then, whose _Muse_ produces ought that's _fine_,
  His _Head_ must have a _stronger Turn_ than mine:
  Like _Sybils Leaves_ the _Train of Thoughts_ are rang'd,
  Which by _rude Winds_ disturb'd, are _nothing_ if they're chang'd.
  Or are there too in _Writing softer Hours_?
  Or is't that _Matter_ nobler _Mind_ o'erpow'rs,
  Which boasts her _native Liberty_ in vain,                         380
  In _Mortal Fetters_ and a _Slavish Chain_?
  _Death_ only can the _Gordian Knot_ divide,      }
  Tho by what secret wondrous _Bands_ 'tis ty'd,   }
  Ev'n _Reason's_ self must own she can't decide:  }
  For as the _rapid Tides_ of _Matter_ turn           }
  We're fann'd with _Pleasure_ or with _Anger_ burn,  }
  We _Love_ and _Hate_ again, we _Joy_ and _Mourn_.   }
  Now the swift _Torrent_ high and headstrong grows,
  _Shoots_ through the Dykes, and all the Banks _o'erflows_;
  Strait the _capricious Waters_ backward fly,
  The _Pebbles_ rake and leave the Bottom _dry_;                     390
  Watch the _kind Hour_ and seize the _rising Flood_,
  Else will your _dreggy Poem_ taste of _Mud_.
  Hence old and batter'd _Hackneys_ of the _Stage_,
  By long Experience render'd _Wise_ and _Sage_,
  With pow'rful _Juices_ restive Nature urge,
  Or else with _Bays_ of old, they _bleed_ and _purge_;
  Thence, as the _Priestess_ from her _Cave_ inspir'd,
  When to his _Cell_ the _rancid God_ retir'd,
  _Double Entendres_ their fond _Audience_ blind,
  Their _boasted Oracles_ abuse Mankind:                             400
  _False Joys_ around their _Hearts_ in _Slumbers_ play,
  And the warm _tingling Blood_ steals fast away;
  The _Soul_ grows _dizzy_, lost in _Senses Night_,
  And melts in pleasing _Pain_ and vain _Delight_.
    Not that the _sowrest Critick_ can reprove
  The _soft_ the moving _Scenes_ of _Virtuous Love_:
  _Life's Sunny Morn_, which wears, alas! too fast;
  _Pity_ it e'er should _hurt_, or should not _always last_!
  Has _Bankrupt Nature_ then no _more_ to give,
  Or by a _Trick_ persuades Mankind to _live_?                       410
  No--when with _Prudence_ join'd 'tis still the _same_  }
  Or _ripens_ into _Friendship's_ nobler _Name_,         }
  The _Matter_ pure, immortal is the _Flame_.            }
  No _Fool_, no _Debauchee_ could ever prove
  The _honest Luxury of Virtuous Love_;
  Then _curs'd_ are those who that _fair Name_ abuse,
  And holy _Hymen's_ sacred _Fillets_ loose;
  Who _poison Fountains_, and _infect_ the _Air_,
  _Ruine_ the _Witty_, and _debauch_ the _Fair_;
  With _nauseous Images_ their _Scenes_ debase                       420
  At once their Country's _Ruine_ and _Disgrace_.
  _Weigh_ well each _Thought_ if all be _Just_ and _Right_,
  For those must clearly _think_ who clearly _write_.
  Nothing _obscure_, _equivocal_, or _mean_,
  Much less what is or _impious_ or _obscene_:
  Altho the tempting _Serpent_ play his part,
  And wind in _glitt'ring Folds_ around thy _Heart_;
  Reject the _trait'rous Charmer_, tear him thence,
  And keep thy _Vertue_ and thy _Innocence_.

    In wild _America's_ rank _Champaign_ grows                       430
  A _Tree_ which _Europe_ oft too dearly knows;
  It rises high in _cool inchanting Groves_,
  Whose green broad Leaves the fainting _Trav'ler_ loves;
  _Fair_ is the treach'rous _Fruit_, and charms your _Eye_,
  But ah! beware! for if you _taste_ you _die_.
  Too well alas! it _thrives_ when _planted_ here,
  Its deadly Branches shade our _Theatre_.
    Of _Mesures, Numbers, Pauses_ next I sing,
  And rest the breathless _Muse_ with cautious _Wing_:
  Of _Embryo Thoughts_, unripen'd yet by Time,                       440
  The Rules of _Verse_, of _Quantity_ and _Rhime_:
  With trembling Steps through _Shades_ unknown I stray,
  And mark a _rugged_ and a _dubious_ way;
  Yet some small _glimm'ring Light_ will hence be show'd,
  And future _Trav'lers_ may enlarge the _Road_.
                                                  [Sidenote: _Measure_.]
    Of CHAUCER'S Verse we scarce the _Measures_ know,
  So _rough_ the _Lines_, and so _unequal_ flow;
  Whether by Injury of _Time_ defac'd,
  Or _careless_ at the _first_, and writ in _haste_;
  Or _coursly_, like old _Ennius_, he _design'd_                     450
  What After-days have _polish'd_ and _refin'd_.
  SPENCER more _smooth_ and _neat_, and none than He
  Could better skill of _English Quantity_;
  Tho by his _Stanza_ cramp'd, his _Rhimes_ less chast,
  And _antique Words_ affected all disgrac'd;
  Yet _vast_ his _Genius, noble_ were his _Thoughts_,
  Whence equal Readers wink at _lesser_ Faults.
    "The sick rabble" is the name given by the men
  to the crowd that waits outside the door of
  the M.O.'s room at eight in the morning. And every morning brings its
  quota of ailing soldiers; some seriously ill,
  some slightly, and a few (as may be expected
  out of a thousand men of all sorts and
  conditions) who have imaginary or feigned
  diseases that will so often save
  "slackers" from a hard day's marching. The aim
  and ambition of these latter seem to be
  to do as little hard work as possible; some of
  them attend sick parade on an average once a week,
  and generally obtain exemption from a day's work. To obtain this they
  resort to several ruses; headaches and rheumatic pains
  are difficult to detect, and the doctor must
  depend on the private's word; a quick pulse and
  heightened temperature is engendered by a brisk
  run, and this is often a means towards a favourable
  medical verdict--that is, when "favourable" means
  a suspension of duties.
  
  At a quarter to eight I stood with ten others
  in front of the M.O.'s door, on which a white card with the blue-lettered
  "No Smoking" stood out in bold relief.
  The morning was bitterly cold, and a sharp,
  penetrating wind splashed with rain swept round our
  ears, and chilled our hands and faces. One of the
    waiting queue had a sharp cough and spat
  blood; all this was due, he told us, to a day's
  divisional field exercise, when he had to lie for
  hours on the wet ground firing "blanks" at a "dummy" enemy.Our _Ear's_ the Judge of _Cadence_; nicely weigh
  What _Consonants_; rebel, and what obey;                           490
  What _Vowels_ mixt compose a pleasing _Sound_,
  And what the tender _Organs_ grate and wound.
  Nor at thy Reader's _Mercy_ chuse to lie,
  Nor let _his Judgment_ want of _thine_ supply:
  So _easie_ let thy _Verse_ so _smoothly_ fall,
  They must be read _aright_ if read at all.
                                                  [Sidenote: _Numbers_.]
  Nor _equal Numbers_ will for all suffice,
  The _Sock_ creeps low, the _Tragic Bushkins_ rife;
  None knew this _Art_ so well, so well did use
  As did the _Mantuan Shepherd's_ Heav'nly Muse:                     500
  He marry'd _Sound and Sense_, at odds before,
  We hear his _Scylla bark, Charybdis roar_;
  And when in Fields his _Fiery Coursers_ meet
  The _hollow Ground_ shakes underneath their feet:
  Yet nicer _Ears_ can taste a _Diff'rence_ when
  Of _Flocks_ and _Fields_ he _sings_ or _Arms_ and _Men_.
  If I our _English Numbers_ taste aright,
  We in the grave _Iambic_ most delight:
  Each _second_ Syllable the Voice should _rest_,
  _Spondees_ may serve, but still th' _Iambic's_ best:               510
  Th' unpleasing _Trochee_ always makes a _Blot_,
  And lames the _Numbers_; or, if this forgot,
  A strong _Spondaic_ should the _next_ succeed,
  The feeble _Wall_ will a good _Buttress_ need:
  Long _Writing, Observation, Art_ and _Pain_
  Must here unite if you the _Prize_ would gain.
                                                   [Sidenote: _Pauses_.]
    _Pause_ is the _Rest_ of _Voice_, the poor _Remains_
  Of _antient Song_ that still our _Verse_ retains:
  The _second Foot_ or _third's_ our usual _Rest_,
  Tho more of _Art's_ in _varying_ oft exprest.                      520
  At ev'ry Word the _Pause_ is sometimes[3] made,
  And wond'rous _Beauty_ every where displaid:
  --But here we _guess_, and _wander_ in the _dark_;
  How should a hoodwink'd _Archer_ hit the Mark?
  Never did I hear any thing more sonorously grand
  and awful than that portentous inbreathing
  of Gog and Magog, resounding through the Gothic
  vastness of Guildhall; but, behold! how
  omnipotent is the dreaming imagination! I
  myself had been dozing; the sound of my own nose, transferred by a
    metonymy of the fancy to the nostrils of those
        wooden idols, had become, as it were, the living
  apotheosis of a snore, which had
  subdued me by its sublimity.
  Most fortunate was it that I awoke;
  for, on attentively inspecting the faces of the
  figures, I saw them working and writhing with all the
  contortions of the Pythoness or the Sibyl, labouring in the very
throes of inspiration, struggling with the advent of the prophetical
afflatus.[Sidenote: _Quantity_.]
    But little more of _Quantity_ we know
  Than what our _Accent_ does, and _Custom_ show:                    540
  The _Latin Fountains_ often we forsake,
  As they the _Greek_; nay _diff'rent Ages_ take
  A _diff'rent Path; Perfùme_ and _Envy_ now
  We say, which _Ages past_ would scarce allow:
  If no _Position_ make our _Accent_ strong
  Most _Syllables_ are either _short_ or _long_.
                                                    [Sidenote: _Rhime_.]
    _Primitive Verse_ was grac'd with pleasing _Rhimes_,
  The _Blank_ a lazy Fault of _After-times_;
  Nor need we other proof of this to plead
  With those the sacred [5] _Hebrew Hymns_ can _read_:               550
  If this to _lucky Chance_ alone be _due_,
  Why _Rhime_ they not in _Greek_ and _Latin_ too?
  Is that clear to every man?"
  It was, indeed, clear, surprisingly clear; but we
  wondered at the command, which was new to us.
  To answer in this fashion appeared strange to us; we
  thought (the right to think is not denied
  to a soldier) it a funny method of satisfying
  a general's curiosity.
  
  He came, a tall, well-set man, with stern eyebrows and
  a heavy moustache, curled upwards after the manner
  of an Emperor whom we heartily dislike,
  attended by a slim brigade major, who wore a rather large eyeglass,
and made several entries in his notebook, as he followed on the
heels of the superior inspecting the battalion.
We stood, every unit of us, sphinx-like, immovable, facing our front
and resigned to our position.[Sidenote: _Vide p._ 13.]
    Ne'er _cramp_ thy _Reason_ for some paltry _Chime_,
  Nor sacrifice _Good Sense_ to _Numbers_ and to _Rhime_:
  Both may be _sav'd_ and made _good Friends_; and here
  The Poets _Art_ and _Happiness_ appear:
  But when some _stubborn Word_ denies to draw
  In _Numbers_, and defies the _Muses Law_,                          570
  Reject it strait, unworthy such a _Grace_,
  Another _yoke_ which better fills the _Place_:
  Much _Reading_ will thy _Poverty_ amend
  And _Taggs_ without the help of _Crambo_ lend.
    The _Double Rhime_ is _antiquated_ grown,
  Or us'd in _Satyr_ or _Burlesque_ alone;
  Nor loves our stronger _Tongue_ that tinkling _Chime_,
  The _Darling_ of the _French_, a _Female Rhime_.
