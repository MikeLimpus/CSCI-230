BRIEF ACCOUNT OF ZUÑI MYTHOLOGY.


The Pueblo of Zuñi is situated in Western New Mexico on the Rio Zuñi,
a tributary of the Little Colorado River. The Zuñi have resided
in this region for several centuries. The peculiar geologic and
geographic character of the country surrounding them, as well as its
aridity, furnishes ample sources from which a barbarous people would
derive legendary and mythologic history. A brief reference to these
features is necessary to understand more fully the religious phases of
Zuñi child life.

Three miles east of the Pueblo of Zuñi is a conspicuously beautiful
mesa, of red and white sandstone, t[=o]-w[=a]-yäl län-ne (corn
mountain). Upon this mesa are the remains of the old village of Zuñi.
The Zuñi lived during a long period on this mesa, and it was here that
Coronado found them in the sixteenth century. Tradition tells that
they were driven by a great flood from the site they now occupy, which
is in the valley below the mesa, and that they resorted to the mesa
for protection from the rising waters. The waters rose to the very
summit of the mesa, and to appease the aggressive element a human
sacrifice was necessary. A youth and a maiden, son and daughter of two
priests, were thrown into this ocean. Two great pinnacles, which have
been carved from the main mesa by weathering influences, are looked
upon by the Zuñi as the actual youth and maiden converted into stone,
and are appealed to as "father" and "mother." Many of the Zuñi legends
and superstitions are associated with this mesa, while over its summit
are spread the extensive ruins of the long ago deserted village.
There are in many localities, around its precipitous sides and walls,
shrines and groups of sacred objects which are constantly resorted
to by different orders of the tribe. Some of the most interesting of
these are the most inaccessible. When easy of approach they are in
such secluded spots that a stranger might pass without dreaming of
the treasures within his reach. On the western side of this mesa
are several especially interesting shrines. About half way up the
acclivity on the west side an overhanging rock forms the base of one
of the pinnacles referred to. This rock is literally honeycombed
with holes, from one-half to three-fourths of an inch in diameter. I
visited the spot in the fall of 1884, with Professors E.B. Tylor and
H.N. Moseley, of Oxford, England, and Mr. G.K. Gilbert, of the United
States Geological Survey. These gentlemen could not determine whether
the tiny excavations were originally made by human hands or by some
other agency. The Indian's only answer when questioned was, "They
belong to the old; they were made by the gods." Hundreds of these holes
contain bits of cotton and wool from garments. In the side of this
rock there are larger spaces, in which miniature vases, filled with
sand, are placed. The sand is ground by rubbing stones from the same
rock. The vases of sand, and also the fragments of wool and cotton,
are offerings at the feet of the "mother" rock. Here, too, can be seen
a quantity of firewood heaped as shown in the right-hand corner of
the illustration. Each man and woman deposited a piece, that he or
she might always have plenty of wood for heat and light. Some three
hundred feet above is another shrine, directly attached to the
"father" rock, and to the white man difficult of access. Here I found
many offerings of plume sticks (T[=e] l[=i]k-tk[=i]-n[=a]-we).

Before entering upon the purely mythologic phases of Zuñi child life
I will present a brief sketch of some of the Zuñi beliefs. There are
thirteen secret orders in Zuñi, in many of which women and children
are conspicuous, besides the purely mythologic order of the
K[=o]k-k[=o]. All boys are initiated into this order, while but few
girls enter it. It is optional with a girl; she must never marry if
she joins the K[=o]k-k[=o], and she is not requested to enter this
order until she has arrived at such age as to fully understand its
grave responsibilities and requirements.

Let us follow the Zuñi tradition of the ancient time, when these
people first came to this world. In journeying hither they passed
through four worlds, all in the interior of this, the passageway
from darkness into light being through a large reed. From the inner
world they were led by the two little war gods [=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta and
M[=a]-[=a]-s[=e]-we, twin brothers, sons of the Sun, who were sent by
the Sun to bring these people to his presence. They reached this world
in early morning, and seeing the morning star they rejoiced and said
to the war gods: "We see your father, of whom you have told us." "No,"
said the gods, "this is the warrior who comes before our father;"
and when the sun arose the people fell upon the earth and bowed their
heads in fear. All their traditions point to the distant land of their
appearance in this world as being in the far northwest; from, there
they were accompanied by [=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta and M[=a]-[=a]-s[=e]-we.
These little gods occupy important positions in Zuñi myth and legend.
After long journeying, it was decided that the Priest Doctor (K[=a]
wi-m[=o] sa) should send his son and his daughter in advance to
discover some favorable spot upon which to build a village. The youth
and the maiden finally ascended a peak from, which to have an extended
view of the country. "Rest here, my sister, for you are tired," said
the youth, "and I will go alone." From fatigue, the girl soon sank
into a slumber, and when the youth returned, he was impressed with the
surpassing loveliness of his sister. They remained for a time on this
mountain, and at their union they were transformed--the youth into a
hideous looking creature, the K[=o]-y[=e]-m[=e]-shi (Plate XX); the
maiden into a being with snow white hair, the K[=o]-m[=o]-k[)e]t-si.
The [t]K[=o]-thl[=a]-ma (hermaphrodite) is the offspring of this
unnatural union. The youth said to his sister, "We are no longer like
our people; we will therefore make this mountain our home. But it
is not well for us to be alone; wait here and I will go and prepare
a place for our others." Descending the mountain, he swept his foot
through the sands in the plains below, and immediately a river flowed
and a lake appeared, and in the depths of this lake a group of houses,
and in the center of this group a religious assembly house, or kiva,
provided with many windows, through which those not privileged to
enter the kiva might view the dance within. After he performed this
magic deed, he again joined his sister on the mountain, from which
they could see their people approaching. The mountain has since that
time borne the name of K[=o]-k[=o]k-shi--k[=o]k-shi meaning good.

The first of the [=A]h-shi-wi, or Zuñi, to cross this river were
the Än-shi-i-que, or Bear gens; T[=o]-w[=a]-que, Corn gens; and
[t]Ko-[=o]h-l[=o]k-t[=a]-que, Sand Hill Crane gens. When in the
middle of the river the children of these gentes were transformed into
tortoises, frogs, snakes, ducks, and dragonflies. The children thus
transformed, while tightly clinging to their mother's necks, began to
bite and pinch. The mothers, trembling with fear, let them fall into
the river. [=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta and M[=a]-[=a]-s[=e]-we, missing the
children, inquired, "Where are the little ones?" The mothers replied,
"We were afraid and dropped them into the water." The war gods then
cried out to the remainder of the people, "Wait, wait until we speak
with you," and they told the women to be brave and cling tightly to
the children until they crossed the river. Obeying the gods' commands,
they carried the little ones over, though they were transformed just
as the others. Upon reaching the opposite shore, they were again
restored to their natural forms, excepting their hands, which were
duck-webbed. These webs were cut with [=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta's stone knife
and thus restored to perfect hands.

The mothers whose children fell into the waters were grieved and
refused to be comforted. The Priest Doctor was also grieved, and
said, "Alas, where have the little ones gone?" [=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta and
M[=a]-[=a]-s[=e]-we replied, "We will go and learn something of them,"
and upon descending into the lake they found the beautiful kiva, in
which the children were assembled; but again they had been changed;
they were no longer reptiles, but were of a similar type to the
K[=o]-y[=e]-m[=e]-shi and K[=o]-m[=o]-k[)e]t-si, and since that
time they have been worshiped as ancestral gods, bearing the name
of K[=o]k-k[=o]; but the little war gods knew them, and addressed
them as "My children," and they replied, "Sit down and tell us of
our mothers." When they told them that their mothers refused to be
comforted at their loss, they said, "Tell our mothers we are not dead,
but live and sing in this beautiful place, which is the home for them
when they sleep. They will wake here and be always happy. And we are
here to intercede with the Sun, our father, that he may give to our
people rain, and the fruits of the earth, and all that is good for
them." The [=A]h-shi-wi then journeyed on, led by [=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta
and M[=a]-[=a]-s[=e]-we, to the present site of Zuñi. Many, however,
lingered at a spring some fifteen miles west of Zuñi, and there
established the village Tk[=a]p-qu[=e]-n[=a] (Hot Spring).

The K[=o]-y[=e]-m[=e]-shi and K[=o]-m[=o]-k[)e]t-si passed down
through the interior of the mountain into the depths of the lake, the
waters of everlasting happiness. In the passageway are four chambers,
where the couple tarried on their way and where at the present time
the two priests of the K[=o]k-k[=o] rest in their journey to the
sacred waters. So credulous are the people that the priests delude
them into the belief that they actually pass through the mountain to
the lake.

Having heard of the wonderful cave in this mountain, our little party
visited the place, prepared to explore it. Mr. Stevenson and Mr.
H.L. Turner entered the fissure in the rock and squeezed through the
crevice for sixteen or eighteen feet to where the rock was so solid
that they both determined no human creature could penetrate farther.
They examined the place most carefully by means of an artificial
light. Through a small aperture stones could be thrown to a depth from
which no sound returned, but excepting this solitary opening all was
solid, immovable rock. In this cave many plume sticks were gathered.
Near the opening of the cave, or fissure, is a shrine to the
K[=o]k-k[=o], which must be very old, and over and around it are
hundreds of the plume sticks and turquoise and shell beads.

I would mention here a little incident illustrative of the
superstitious dread these Indians entertain of violating the priestly
commands. We found it very difficult to persuade an old Zuñi guide,
who had visited the sacred salt lake, the mountain of the war gods,
and other places of interest with us (to these he had gone by special
permission of the High Priest), to accompany us to the spirit lake and
the mountain of the K[=o]k-k[=o]. Our persuasive powers were almost
exhausted ere we could induce him to guide us to them, but having
consented he was willing to go even if he should be punished by death.
He was a man renowned for bravery, but he was so overcome by his
superstitious fears that his voice sank to a whisper and finally
became scarcely audible. The morning of the day on which we reached
this place, the old man, who had been riding by my side, ahead of the
rest of the party, suddenly halted and said in a half-angry voice,
"Why do I go ahead? I am not the chief of this party. Those who belong
at the head must go to the head." And he would not move until Mr.
Stevenson and I went in advance. By this change he sought to transfer
the responsibility to us. Finally he rode up to us and said in a
whisper, "We will camp here." The whole expression of the old man's
face was that of ghastly terror. I was much annoyed, for I thought
that, at the eleventh hour, his fear had overcome his desire to
gratify us. Just then a Mexican lad on horseback approached; we were
all mounted. I asked the lad, "Is there a lake near by?" He replied,
"Yes, a half a mile off." The old Indian said, speaking in a whisper,
"And you have seen it?" "Yes." "And you were not afraid?" "No; why
afraid?" "And you looked into the waters and you did not die!" With a
look of bewilderment the youth rode off. I signaled to the old man to
accompany us to the lake. "No, no; I would only die, and you must not
go or you will die." "No," said I, "we will not die if our hearts are
good, and if you will not go it is because your heart is not good and
you are afraid."

We found the lake so surrounded by marshes that we could not get
within an eighth of a mile of the waters. One of our party attempted
to reach it on foot, but could get very little nearer. We made a
circuit of the lake along the slightly elevated ground and could
distinctly see it.

On completing the circle a striking picture met our eyes. Boldly
outlined by the setting sun stood the old man, his hair blown by the
evening breeze, for he had bared his head of the usual kerchief worn
around it, and, with his hand holding the sacred meal extended toward
the glorious sunset, he stood repeating a prayer. We halted, and he
continued his prayer, wholly unconscious of our presence; as he turned
we surprised him. I extended my hand and said, "Now I am happy, for
you are again brave and strong." "Yes," said he, "my heart is glad. I
have looked into the waters of my departed people. I am alive, but I
may die; if I die it is well; my heart is glad." From that moment the
gloom was gone and he was bright and happy. We could not induce the
old man to ascend the mountain of the K[=o]k-k[=o] with us, as none go
there except certain priests; but the lake is visited by those who are
designated by these priests.

Several days were consumed by us in exploring this immediate vicinity.
On breaking camp, our old Indian guide seemed determined to tarry
behind. I remained with him. As the party rode off he took a large
quantity of food which he had carefully stored away behind a tree--he
having observed an almost absolute fast in order to make a large
offering to the spirits of the departed--and heaped this food upon
the embers of the camp fire, by the side of which he stood for a long
time, supplicating in a most solemn manner the spirits of the departed
to receive his offering.

Certain men are selected, who, with bodies nude save the loin skirt
and with bare feet, walk from Zuñi to the lake, a distance of 45
miles, exposed to the scorching rays of the summer sun, to deposit
plume sticks and pray for rain. If the hearts of those sent be pure
and good, the clouds will gather and rain will fall, but if evil be in
their hearts no rain will fall during the journey and they return with
parched lips and blistered skin. The K[=o]k-k[=o] repeat the prayers
for rain with their intercessions to the Yä-t[=o]-tka, the Sun, and
by them the plume sticks are sent to the same great god. So constantly
are the lesser gods employed in offering plumes to the great god
that at night the sacred road (the Galaxy) can be seen filled with
feathers, though by day they are invisible. They believe that the soul
or essence of the plumes travels over this road, just as the soul from
the body travels from Zuñi to the spirit lake, and in their offerings
of food the food itself is not received by the gods, but the spiritual
essence of the food.

One of the most important characters in Zuñi mythology, the Käk-l[=o],
finding himself alone in the far Northwest, saw many roads, but could
not tell which one led to his people, and he wept bitterly. [Greek:
molybdoides] in Greek, as reported in Dioskorides can hieher belong,
so the newer name borrowed - _molybdaena, sulfuret of molybdaena_ in
English - in French _molybdène sulfuré_ - _molybdena, lapis plomo_ in
Spanish -- -_molibdena_ in Russian and Polish - _malibda, malibdika_
in Bengali, translated with Molybdates, molilybdic is probably newer,
European origin. * * * * * # §. 15. Cobalt #. The cobalt metal
will not reach before, it is difficult from the ores reducieren
granted no technical benefit. The most common is the sulfur or cobalt
Kobaltkies (gloss Speis and cobalt), which Smalt is used, the insignificant
Kobaltoxyd, with different color than black and red Erdkobalt,
Kobaltblüthe cobalt, etc. The word is of Slavic origin Seyn coherently
with Kow di ore , kowalti erzartig, therefore Kobolt, Kobelt, thus
Hüttemann the impure metal mixtures called Beyme the primary smelting
of gravel, etc., concerns the miner but vorzüglich ores, the
arsenikalische emit fumes in the fire, such as arsenic and Kobaltkies,
so he also nice , scherbenförmigen arsenic scherben called cobalt.

Science is the name peculiar to the cobalt metal is limited to
the cobalt in the Czecishchen [Czech] dasik means. The Chinese people
since ancient times knew the blue cobalt glass, hence the Kobalterze;
to the Roman and Greek Alterthume is cobalt blue glass (Smalt ) came
to us, we must also then have the Kobalterze knew, but we know with
certainty where the same has been prepared, as the ores were called,
but you probably understood it androdamas and argyrodamas (see
Arsenikkies). A. _Speiskobalt_. Kobalterz The most common, a combination
of cobalt, arsenic and iron much, therefore, to develop strong
Arsenikdämpfe coals. Is of white and gray color, often krystallisirt.
Smalt Behufs of fabrication, the ore is roasted, the sulfur and arsenic
to evaporate, then with quartz and potash together, dabey separates a
metallic connection from the nickel, Wissmuth, silver, etc., and
_Speise_ means. The word food, woher Speis cobalt, in the
Saxon-Bohemian Mine language fairly distributed, is of Slavic
origin Seyn, connected with _spitz, spiza_ in Czech, which means
Broncefarbe or bronze, so called food, dining, the bell metal bells,
dining is the yellow cobalt King that you try Beyme kobalthaltiger
ores receives bleispeise is Beyme Bleischmelzen the yellow mixture
of cobalt, copper and sulfur in the oven works on the stand; cobalt
food is unclean yellow cobalt, which melts Beyme kobalthaltiger
silver, also Beyme melting of cobalt glass forms, speisiges ore is
yellow, gravelly _koboljt_ etc. in Russian, - _kobalt_ in Polish -
_kobalt_, even in the Czech _dasik_ - _kobold, Kobelt, graupenkobelt,
kobaltspiegel_, even _speise_ of the Saxon and Bohemian miners; -
_koboltercz szörke_ the Magyar - _kobolt_ in Swedish -
_cobaltgris-arsenical_ in French - _arsenical cobalt_ in English.

B. _Kobaltglanz, Glanzkobalt_. Cobalt metal with iron and arsenic as
the wenigerm Speis cobalt, röthlich white paint, mostly krystallisirt,
particularly common in Sweden. _koboltglantz, Koboltmalm_ in Swedish
- _koboljt loskowoi_ in Russian - in the Czech _saudasec_ - _oright,
white cobalt, kobaltglance_ in English - in the middle _zaffera_
Latin. C. _Erdkobalt, Kobaltblüthe_. Kobaltoxyd, more or less pure,
of black, even red color, earthy, without any technical application,
is used only rarely to Smaltefabrication. _schlackenkobold, Koboldblüthe_
Teutsche the miners - _cobalt oxydé_ in French - in _cobalt ochre_
French. D. _Smalte_. Cobalt blue glass, ground, and further geschlemmt
different blue colors präparirt is Smalt; escher, Eschel is a
pale Smalt; zaffer means life in general Kobaltoxyd the roasted
powder mixed with gravel, which serves blue glaze pottery. Although
the Alterthum Smalt knew, but so was the art to prepare completely
lost, and only probably invented around 1540 Ch Schürer, a
Bohemian glassmakers and again around 1570, there were already
several Smalt factories in Bohemia and Saxony, and soon took hold
of Dutch trading this article, as Azura del Alemagna went to Italy. The
name is of Slavic origin smalt Seyn means Smel, szalc in Slavonic.
_pe-Tsing_ in Chinese. _smele_ in Czech - _szmalc_ in Polish - _smolcz_
in Croatian - _spushanstvu, svaritge_ in Windische - _smalts,
blästarkelse_ in Swedish - _smaltum_ in the Middle Ages, even _azura
del alemagna_ in Italy (ie Teutsche ultramarine); _zaffera_ also
(as was also the Kobalterze called) is probably of [Greek: sapheiros],
di glaze stone; it formed safflor how to use even the crude jetzo
not duly called präparirte Smalt - _safr_, even _azur sacado de
cobalto_ in Spanish; - _zaffer_ in English - _esmalte_ in Portuguese
- _smalt_ in French. * * * * * # §. 16.

Wissmuth #. A.

_Das Metallic Wissmuth_. The solid Wissmuth found by the Wissmutherzen
most frequently, but it is a rare metal that only in Saxony in the
Great is applied sparingly, there is the sulphurated Wissmuth or
Wissmuthglanz and earthy oxide, the Wissmuthocker.

The metal is preferably characterisirt through his extraordinary
light liquid, it melts in the flame of light, even on a hot stove.

With Spies giebt shine it on the metal-type book - with tin and lead
giebt gives it a particularly easy liquid metal, which Bey certain
conditions in the boiling water melts, the exquisite to the
battlements and Löthen lead serves. The zinc is through Wissmuth this
alloy harder and conterfait told otherwise, guntelfer (such as the
zinc is also called), and a metal one else moved from India, where
the Wissmuth always been known Seyn will.

The Romans and Greeks have the metal and perhaps knew it plumbum
understood, but it does not stand firmly. In the pharmacy told
otherwise: margasita officinalis, aschblei, plumbum cinereum,
stannum cinereum. The name may come from the Slavic, if he is not of
Indian origin. _wismata_ (Spoken bismuta) in Bengal (whether perhaps
from the European languages ?);--_ vismouth, wismut_ in Russian -

Magyar - _vissmut, askbly_ in Swedish and Danish - _bismuth_ in Dutch
- _tinglas_, even _bismuth_ in English - _bismute, ETAIN de glace_ in
French - _bismute_ in Italian , Spanish, Portuguese. Alchemiker The
first mention _wismut_, rather than call them synonymous conterfayn
and mythan (probably an oriental word, meaning dark) appear below
wismat pyrite probably also understood to have been - Albert the
Great (around 1250 ) understands the Wissmuth under marchasita, Basil
Valentine (circa 1500) mentions Bismuth and bismuth.

B. _Wissmuthglanz_. Schwefelwissmuth A, of gray color. _bismuth Sulfuré_
in French, similar to the newer languages. C. _Wissmuthocker_. Wissmuthoxyd
A yellow, from yellow, earthy, of rare occurrence. _wismatblüet_ Of
the Saxon and Bohemian miners; - _bismuth oxydé_ in French and
similarly in other languages. D. _Weisses Wissmuthoxyd_. This chemical
product is the reason for most of white makeup. _magisterium Vismuti_
or _marcasittae_ of the older writers, - _blanc d'Espagne_ in French
- _schminkweiss, Spanish weiss_ in Teutsche - _hwit smink_ in Swedish.
* * * * * # §. 17. Lead #. A. _Das Metallic Blei_. Lead, tin and zinc,

Those of the North are painted yellow; those
of the West, blue; those of the South, red; those of the East, white;
those of the Heavens, all colors on the body and yellow on the neck
and upper arms; those of the Earth, black, with some bits of color.
This done, the Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the North passes through the
village and, going for a short distance to the north, deposits a
plume stick, the stick to which the plumes are attached being painted
yellow. The Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the West, South, and East plant
their plumes at their respective cardinal points. Those for the zenith
and nadir are planted to the west, on the road to the spirit lake, the
stick of each one having the cardinal color decorations. This done,
all retire to their kivas.

The Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the North, returning to his kiva, drinks
the medicine water prepared by the priest of the great fire order
(M[=a]-[t]ke-hl[=a]n-[=a] [=a]-que), who, with some of his people, is
now busy in the preparation of a sand altar. The Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya
again emerge from the kivas, with long bunches of Spanish bayonet in
their hands, in the ends of which grains of corn of the respective
colors are placed and wrapped with shreds of the bayonet. Any
man or youth desiring to raise yellow corn appeals to the
Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the North, who strikes him a severe blow with
his bunch of bayonets. Similar appeals are made to those representing
other colors. The sand altar is made in the Kiva of the North. It is
first laid in the ordinary yellowish sand, in the center of which the
bowl of medicine water is placed. Over the yellow sand a ground
of white sand is sprinkled. All the Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya and their
brothers are represented on the altar (Plate XXII). The altar
is circular in form and some twelve feet in diameter. The
K[=o]-l[=o]-oo-w[)i]t-si encircles the whole.

Throughout the day the K[=o]k-k[=o] are running around the village
whipping such of the people as appeal to them for a rich harvest,
while the curious performances of the K[=o]-y[=e]-m[=e]-shi carry one
back to the primitive drama.

[Plate XXII: ZUÑI SAND ALTAR IN KIVA OF THE NORTH.]

Toward evening the ceremony for initiating the children begins. The
priest of the Sun, entering the sacred plaza (or square), sprinkles a
broad line of sacred meal from the southeast entrance across the south
side, thence along the western side to the Kiva of the North, and
up the ladderway to the entrance (which is always in the roof), and
then passing over the housetops he goes to the Kiva of the Earth and
sprinkles the meal upon the K[=o]-l[=o]-oo-w[)i]t-si. These violent

The remainder of the ledge is filled with the
boys and their friends. Nai-[=u]-chi, the living representative of
[=A]h-ai-[=u]-ta, the war god, sits to the left of the fire altar
as you enter and feeds the sacred flames. The Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya
enter immediately after P[=a]-oo-t[=i]-wa. All these, including
P[=a]-oo-t[=i]-wa, enter head foremost; the head touches the stone
slab over the fire, and, completing a somersault, they vault into the
room on all fours and in like manner pass to the right of the kiva
and around to their places. P[=a]-oo-t[=i]-wa is followed by the
Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the North and others in proper order and rapid
succession, the hind one always hopping into the foot and hand prints
of the former. In the two kivas mounds of sand have been laid for the
K[=o]k-k[=o] and each one sits upon his mound. These mounds are some
eighteen inches in diameter and a foot in height (Plate XXIII). When
all have taken their places the Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the North
arises and taking the wand from his mound walks to the group
immediately to the right of the ladder as one enters. Holding the wand
between his hands, he goes to each child and blows four times upon the
wand, at the same time extending it toward the mouth of the child, who
draws from it each time the sacred breath which passes from the mouth
of the K[=o]k-k[=o] over the plumes. The [t]S[=i]-[t]s[=i]-[t]ki
carries the rabbit in addition to the wand, and over them he passes
the sacred breath of the little grandfather. The godparent covers the
eyes of the child with his hand, for the children must not look upon
the K[=o]k-k[=o] near by. The Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the North is
followed by the Sä-lä-m[=o]-b[=i]-ya of the West and others, all in
turn going to each child; as each one completes the round he places
his wand in his belt, stands in the center of the kiva, and turns
a somersault over the fire, striking his head on the fire slab as
before, and so leaves the kiva feet foremost.

[Plate XXIII: [=O]H-H[=E]-I-QUE, KIVA OF THE EAST.]

The K[=o]-l[=o]-oo-w[)i]t-si now appears at the hatchways. He
is brought by the priest of the K[=o]-l[=o]-oo-w[)i]t-si and the
Soot-[=i]ke. The high priest, the priest of the bow, and priestess
of the earth advance to the hatchway, each holding a large
earthen bowl, and catch the water poured from the mouth of the
K[=o]-l[=o]-oo-w[)i]t-si. Each guardian then fills the small bowl
which he carries with the holy water and, drinking a portion of it,
gives the remainder to the boy to drink. The bowl which contains it
is a gift from the godfather. The boy sprinkles the corn stacked
in his house with this water. After the water is exhausted from
the large bowls a blanket is held by four men to catch the seeds
of all the cereals which are sent up from the abdomen of the
K[=o]-l[=o]-oo-w[)i]t-si. These are taken from the blankets by three
priests and placed in their own blankets, which rest over the left
arm, and they, passing around, distribute the seeds to all present.
The sand of the fallen mounds is gathered in a blanket and deposited
in the river, to be carried to the home of the K[=o]k-k[=o]. The boys
now return to their homes, accompanied by the guardian and one other
of their attendants. In the early morning the sister of the godfather
goes for the boy and brings him to her house, where he enjoys a
sumptuous breakfast. The godfather then leads the boy to the east for
some distance from the village, sprinkling a line of sacred meal,
and here he says a prayer, which the boy repeats after him, and the
godfather, making a hole in the ground, plants a plume stick which he
has made for the child.

From this time the child eats no animal food for four days. The plume
which has been placed on the child's head in the kiva during the
initiation is not removed till the fourth morning after the planting
of the feathers, when he again goes over the road with his guardian,
who deposits the plume from the child's head with a prayer, which is
repeated by the child.

Thus ends this remarkable initiation of the Zuñi male child into the
order of the K[=o]k-k[=o]. This is really mainly done by sponsors, and
he must personally take the vows as soon as he is old enough.


VOLUNTARY INITIATION INTO THE K[=O]K-K[=O].


After the first initiation of a boy into this order, he is left to
decide for himself when he will assume the vows made for him by his
sponsors, though the father and the godfather do not fail to impress
upon the boy the importance of the second initiation, which occurs at
an annual ceremonial; and when the boy has declared his determination
to enter the order, if the K[=o]k-k[=o] upon seeing him deem him too
young, he is ordered to return to his home and wait awhile till his
heart has become more wise. For this ceremonial the godparents and
the boys assemble in the Kiva of the North. Each boy in turn takes his
position to receive his whipping, which is necessary for initiation.
The godfather, standing, bends his right knee, which the boy clasps,
bowing his head low. The godfather holds the two ends of the
blanket and buckskin tightly around the boy, while each of the four
Sai-[=a]-hli-[=a] in turn give him four strokes across the back with
a bunch of the yucca blades. Two of the K[=o]-y[=e]-m[=e]-shi stand by
and count the strokes; the others are in the plaza outside, indulging
in their primitive games, which excite much merriment among the large
assemblage of people. Don Enrique de Vedia, credited as a writer and
publicist and teaching force, had several times seen his qualities and
a gifted storyteller inventive. However, in purely artistic and literary
genre, had not yet produced the work which was to be expected and
arrives today con_ TRANSFUSION, _como a summary of energy and synthesis

Among the trials that this book deserved, when he saw the light,
is the following, which expresses, with particular success, the
ideological concept and a moral purpose that "Transfusion" responds: "
Rosario, July 15, 1908.The feast opens with a grace said by
the priest of the K[=o]k-k[=o], who immediately after collects upon
a piece of H[=e]-wi (a certain kind of bread) bits of all the food
served. This he rolls up and places by his side, and at the conclusion
of the feast he carries it to a distance from, the village over the
road to the spirit lake and making a hole in the ground he deposits it
as an offering to the gods. Each child goes to the godfather's house,
where his head and hands are bathed in yucca suds by the mother and
sisters of the godfather, they repeating prayers that the youth may be
true to his vows, &c. The boy then returning to his own home is tested
by his father, who says, "You are no longer ignorant; you are no
longer a little child, but a young man. Were you pleased with the
words of the K[=o]k-k[=o]? What did the priest tell you?" The boy does
not forget himself and reveal anything that was said, for the terror
overhanging him is too great.

When a youth is selected to personate the K[=o]k-k[=o] he is
instructed in regard to the decorating of the mask he is to wear. When
this is done he goes at night to the proper kiva and seated between
two instructors he learns the song and prayers. In committing songs
and prayers to memory the novice holds a tiny crystal between his
thumb and forefinger for a while, then he puts it into his mouth, and
at the conclusion of the instruction he swallows it. This insures
the remembrance of the prayers and songs, and he awakes the following
morning with them indelibly impressed upon his mind. And you know how
it shows ... ¡Comiendo again for milk again, hoping to reach the
son of his entrails!

... - Eat to satisfy a need. - Exactly! and we must do the same, does

Assuming the K[=o]k-k[=o] vows is
entirely optional with the girl. It is never her duty, but a special
privilege which is rarely accepted. If she accepts she passes through
both ceremonials described. - No, Ricardo, I am not happy at the concept
that everyone understands you and happiness, because happiness involves
a combination of circumstances that are never met, what we have is
that I do not want to be unhappy y. .. No I am!But even
here in Zuñi, where the people are so controlled by the priests and
have such a superstitious dread of disobeying the commands of the
K[=o]k-k[=o], women have been guilty of desecrating their sacred
office and marrying. At present there is a woman of the order of the
K[=o]k-k[=o] married to a Navajo. Big deal! - That's nothing, son, leave
your jobs for a while that you do not know how much, let your girlfriend
leave us and we leave to care for two friends. - You are sick,
