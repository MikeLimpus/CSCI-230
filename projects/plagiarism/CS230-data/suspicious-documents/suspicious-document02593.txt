INTRODUCTION


_The City Bride_, by Joseph Harris, is of special interest as the only
adaptation from the canon of John Webster to have come upon the stage in
the Restoration. Nahum Tate's _Injur'd Love: or, The Cruel Husband_ is
an adaptation of _The White Devil_, but it was never acted and was not
printed until 1707. _The City Bride_ is taken from _A Cure for a
Cuckold_, in which William Rowley and perhaps Thomas Heywood
collaborated with Webster. F. L. Lucas, Webster's most recent and most
scholarly editor, remarks that _A Cure for a Cuckold_ is one of the
better specimens of Post-Elizabethan romantic comedy. In particular, the
character of the bride, Annabel (Arabella in Harris's adaptation), has a
universal appeal. _The City Bride_, a very close copy of its original,
retains its virtues, and has some additional virtues of its own.

Not much is known of its author, Joseph Harris. Genest first notices him
as playing Bourcher, the companion of a French pirate, in _A
Common-Wealth of Women_. Thomas Durfey's alteration of _The Sea Voyage_
from the Beaumont and Fletcher folio, which was produced about September
1685. His subsequent roles were of a similar calibre, but if he never
rose to be a star he seems to have become a valued supporting player,
for in 1692 he was chosen to join the royal "comedians in ordinary." 
Spatolino, with his pistols, killed two, and a few moments saw him
and his band masters of the field. Spatolino ordered his men to
strip the dead, and placing every thing in the wagon, after digging a
pit for the bodies, they retired to a cave in a wood near the road, where
the booty was equally divided.

He took himself two of the best horses, and armed and equipped
his band in a superior manner. He also presented to his wife a part of
the spoil, she having been armed in the action, performing the duty
of a sentinel on the highway in advance about half a mile off, to
give notice, in case of an overwhelming force appearing. Spatolino,
having made a fair division of the spoil to raise the courage of his
companions, sent all his own money to his parents, informing them at the
same time, that for the future they should be released from misery,
as he would ever bear in mind the beings who gave him birth.--_New
Monthly Magazine_.

AN UNINSURABLE RISK.

A bookseller opened a shop on the coast, (I'd rather not mention
the spot,) Where gentlemen lounged o'er the Herald and Post, And ladies
read Byron and Scott.

Much personal memoir, too, shone on the shelves, Which boasted a whimsical
olio; Decorum sang small, in octavoes and twelves, And scandal in
quarto and folio.

The bookseller, prudently aiming to set Th' ignipotent god at defiance,
To open a policy vainly essay'd At the Albion, the Hope, and Alliance.

"My friend, your abortive attempt prithee stop," Quoth Jekyll, intent on
a joke, "How can you expect to insure, while your shop Is rolling out
volumes of smoke?"

LONDON NEWSPAPERS.

On few subjects are the public under more misapprehension than on the
absolute and relative circulation of several portions of the London
daily press.

The greater part of the people would startle were they told that The
Times circulates probably under 7,000 a day on an average; the paper
is seen, as one may say, in every pot-house in London, and all over
the country; and yet this is all its number.

The property of a paper is a matter of which most people have a very vague
and imperfect knowledge. I believe I am very near the truth when I
state the gross proceeds of The Times at 45,000l., a year. The present
proprietor of The Morning Chronicle gave for it, I believe, 40,000l. The
absolute property of The Courier, according to the current rate
of its shares, is between 90,000l. and 100,000l. Estimating the value
of The Globe on the same scale, the absolute property of it is probably
somewhere about 35,000l. The profits of a paper arise almost entirely
out of its advertisements, and hence the difference in value between
the two last, notwithstanding their circulation is so nearly equal. A
newspaper gets its advertisements by degrees, and, as it is supposed
by the public, its numbers increase; but it retains them long after the
cause by which they were acquired has vanished. It is thus that
The Courier, which got its advertisements when it basked in all the
sunshine of ministerial patronage, retains these when its numbers
are reduced by one-half, and the countenance of government is no longer
held out to it.

These, however, it must be admitted, are the prizes in the lottery of
newspaper speculation: and in this, as in every other lottery,
there are more blanks than prizes.

Mr. Murray, after having expended upwards of 10,000l. on his Representative,
sold it to the proprietors of The New Times for about 600l.: and
The British Press, after having ruined I know not how many capitalists,
was sold to the same concern for, I believe, a considerably smaller
sum.--_London Magazine_.

MADEMOISELLE CUVIER.

Mademoiselle Cuvier, daughter of the celebrated naturalist, died a
short time since at Paris.

There has seldom been any instance where the strongest benevolence was
so closely united to the charms of intellect.
She possessed a rare mixture of elevation of mind and firmness of
character--of strength and equanimity--sweetness and simplicity. It was
truly gratifying to witness her worship, or rather superstition, for
truth, and to watch the avidity with which she used to seize and
illustrate whatever she thought likely to remove ignorance, or promote
the cause of virtue and freedom. The circumstances which attended the
death of this amiable creature, have, if possible, greatly augmented the
grief of her family and friends.

The day of her nuptials was fixed, and she was to be united to
a man of her own choice, and everything was prepared for the
ceremony. Being suddenly afflicted by rapid symptoms of consumption, all
hopes of her recovery soon vanished. Notwithstanding, the ball dresses,
veils, and shawls, continued to be sent home to the unhappy parents,
who dared not refuse them, lest they should themselves be accused
of giving way to despair.

This mixture of
preparations for rejoicing,
and the certainty of death, formed a picture the most melancholy
and pathetic.

When the fatal moment arrived, her family and many friends surrounded
the dying couch in mournful silence.

The funeral was attended by all that is distinguished for rank and
fortune at Paris; a clergyman of the Protestant church read the
service for the dead, and a funeral sermon.

A number of young females whom she had formed for succouring the
poor, were ranged round the bier, dressed in white, and followed
to the Cemetery of Père la Chaise, where M.

Salvandy, one of her friends, undertook to deliver the final eulogy,
which it is usual in France to pronounce on departed worth.

HOW TO LOSE TIME.

Few men need complain of the want of time, if they are not conscious
of a want of power, or of desire to ennoble and enjoy it.

Perhaps you are a man of genius yourself, gentle reader, and though
not absolutely, like Sir Walter, a witch, warlock, or wizard, still
a poet--a maker--a creator.

Think, then, how many hours on hours you have lost, lying asleep
so profoundly,
"That the cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more could
rouse you from your lazy bed."

How many more have you, not absolutely lost, but to a certain extent
abused, at breakfast--sip, sipping away at unnecessary cups of
sirupy tea, or gob, gobbling away at jam-buttered rolls, for which
nature never called--or "to party giving up what was meant for
mankind"--forgetting the loss of Time in the Times, and, after a
long, blank, brown, and blue study, leaving behind you a most
miserable chronicle indeed!

    Then think--O think--on all your aimless forenoon
    saunterings--round and round about the premises--up
    and down the avenue--then into the garden on tiptoe--in
    and out among the neat squares of onion-beds--now humming
    a tune by the brink of abysses of mould, like trenches
    dug for the slain in the field of battle,
    where the tender celery is laid--now down
    to the river-side to try a little angling,
    though you well know there is nothing to
    be had but Pars--now into a field
    of turnips, without your double-barreled
    Joe Manton, (at Mr. Wilkinson's to be repaired,)
    to see Ponto point a place where once a
    partridge had pruned himself--now home
    again, at the waving of John's red sleeve,
    to receive a coach-full of country cousins,
    come in the capacity of forenoon
    callers--endless talkers all--sharp and
    blunt noses alike--and grinning voraciously
    in hopes of a lunch--now away to
    dress for dinner, which will not be for two long,
    long hours to come--now dozing, or daized on the
    drawing-room sofa, wondering if the bell is
    ever to be rung--now grimly gazing on a bit
    of bloody beef which your impatience has forced the
    blaspheming cook to draw from the spit ere the outer
    folds of fat were well melted at the fire--now, after
    a disappointed dinner, discovering that the old
    port is corked, and the filberts all pluffing
    with bitter snuff, except such as enclose
    a worm--now an unwholesome sleep of interrupted
    snores, your bobbing head ever and anon smiting
    your breast-bone--now burnt-beans palmed
    off on the family for Turkish coffee--now
    a game at cards, with a dead partner, and
    the ace of spades missing--now no supper--you
    have no appetite for supper--and now into bed
    tumbles the son of Genius, complaining to the
    moon of the shortness of human life, and the fleetness of time!

  SLEEPING AFTER DINNER.
  
  
  Mr. Fox at St. Ann's Hill was, for the last years of his life, in the
  habit (never interfered with by his friends) of dosing for a few minutes
  after dinner; and it was on this occasion, unconsciously yielding to
  the influence of custom, I perceived that Mr. Garrow, who was the chief
  talker (Parr was in his smoking orgasm,) began to feel embarrassed at
  Mr. Fox's non-attention; and I, therefore, made signs to Mr. Fox, by
  wiping my fingers to my eyes, and looking expressively at Garrow.
  Mr.
  Fox, the most _truly_ polite man in the world, immediately endeavoured
  to rouse himself--but in vain; Nature would have her way. Garrow soon
  saw the struggle, and adroitly feigned sleep himself. Mr. Fox was
  regenerated in ten minutes--apologized--and made the evening
  delightful--_Senatorial Reminiscenses_.--_The Inspector_.

CHRONICLES OF THE CANONGATE.

_The Two Drovers._ 
(_Concluded from page 289._)
[Our readers must have missed, and probably with some regret, the
conclusion of the above story, as promised for insertion in our
last Number; and unaccustomed as we are to an intentional discrepancy
of this sort, (for such was the above,) we shall consider ourselves
justified in briefly stating some of the circumstances which led
to the irregularity.

     We are not disposed to enter into the tilts of rival journalists,
     some of whom, in taking time by the forelock, may have perhaps
     been rather more enterprising than the subject warranted.[17]
     Nevertheless, in the attempt to please the public, as in other
races, the youngest are often the fleetest.

In the present case, the appetite of the public had been _whetted_
with "reiterated advertisement:" and one of our contemporaries,
with more playfulness than truth, had compared his priority to that
of _Fine-ear_ in the fairy tale.

    But his talisman failed, and a young
      rival outstripped him; and from
      this quarter we were induced to
    copy the first portion of the tale of
    _The Two Drovers_, upon the editor's
    assurance of his own honesty in
    obtaining the precedence, and
    which assurance We are still unwilling to question: although, were
we to do so, ours would not he a solitary specimen of such
ingratitude.[18] On the day of our publishing the first portion,
we received a notice to desist from its continuance,--full of the
causticity of our friends on the other side of the Tweed, and with
whom, for the credit of the south, we hope the measure originated.

We next resolved to suspend the conclusion; since the _brutum fulmen_
became louder and louder still, in an advertisement actively inserted
in the London newspapers.

To make short of what is and ought to be but a trifling affair, we
have _abridged_ the whole story, and accordingly now present the
conclusion to our readers, though certainly not in the promised
state; how far we have exculpated ourselves, is for our patrons to
determine.

--A few words at parting, on the policy of the above conduct.

We need not enlarge upon the advantages which publishers (and, to
some extent, authors) derive from portions of their works appearing
in periodical journals.

The benefit is not reciprocal, but largely on their side, if they
consider how many columns of advertisement duty they thereby avoid.

It is well known that the _first edition_ of any work by such a
master-spirit as Sir Walter Scott is consumed in a few days by the
circulating libraries and reading societies of the kingdom; but how
many thousands would neither have seen nor heard of his most
successful works, had not the _gusto_ been previously created by
the caducei of these literary Mercuries.

Again, sift any one of them, with higher pretensions to originality
than our economical sheet will admit of, and you shall find it, in
_quantity_, at least, to resemble Gratiano's three grains.

But we are not inclined to quarrel with the scheme, for with Johnson
we say, "Quotation, sir (Walter), is a good thing," in the hope of
hearing our readers reply, "This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas."

--ED.]
Some words passed after the departure, of Robin Oig, between the bailiff,
and Harry Wakefield, who was now not indisposed to defend Robin
Oig's reputation.

But Dame Heskett prevented this second quarrel by her peremptory
interference.

The conversation turned on the expected markets, and the prices from
different parts of Scotland and England, and Harry Wakefield found
a chap for a part of his drove, and at a considerable profit; an
event more than sufficient to blot out all remembrances of the past
scuffle.

But there remained one from whose mind that recollection could not
have been wiped by possession of every head of cattle betwixt Esk
and Eden.

This was Robin Oig M'Combich.--"That I should have had no weapon," he
said, "and for the first time in my life!--Blighted be the tongue that
bids the Highlander part with the dirk--the dirk--ha! the English
blood!--My muhme's word--when did her word fall to the ground?"
Robin now turned the light foot of his country towards the wilds,
through which, by Mr.

    Ireby's report, Morrison was advancing.
    His mind was wholly engrossed by the sense of injury the treasured
ideas of self-importance and self-opinion--of ideal birth and
quality, had become more precious to him, (like the hoard to the
miser,) because he could only enjoy them in secret.

But insulted, abused, and beaten, he was no longer worthy, in his own
opinion, of the name he bore, or the lineage which he belonged
to--nothing was left to him--but revenge.

_Fri._ I thank the kind _Lucy_: There, there's for the Postage Girle:
[_Gives her Money._] She has kept her Promise for once I see; I'm
resolved to read it, thô I were sure my Death was Comprehended in it.

     Reads. _Try all your Friends, and find out the best and nearest to
     your Heart, That done, be sure to kill him for my sake. This fail
     not to do, if you respect and Love (as you pretend.)_

     Clara.

'Tis as I fear'd, and what I know she most desires: Mischief, and
Murder, are all her Sexes Practice, and Delight? Yet such is the
Extravagancy of my Passion, I must obey the Mandate, thô to my certain
Ruine: 'Tis strangely difficult, and does require Mature Deliberation.

[_Exit._

_Spr._ What has _Friendly_ left us?

_Mr. Ven._ I believe the Letter was the occasion, it may be it was a
Challenge.

_Spr._ A Challenge! No, no; Women don't use to bring Challenges, I
rather believe 'tis an Amour; And that Letter as you call it a _Billet
Deux_, which is to Conduct him to the place appointed; and in some Sence
you may take that for a Challenge.

_Mr. Ven._ And she the Civil Embassadress to usher him in.

_Spr._ Yes, yes, but see the Bride and Bridegroom, with the rest of the
good Company.

_Enter Justice_ Merry-man, Bonvile, Arabella, _Mrs._ Venter _and others,
as Guests Invited to the Wedding._

_Mer._ Son _Bonvile_, what call ye the Gentleman we met at the Garden
Door?

_Bon._ _Friendly_ Sir, a most approv'd and worthy Gentleman, and one of
my chiefest Guests.

_Mer._ Ay, ay, it may be so: But yet me thought he seemed somewhat
displeased, thô Son, Hah, What think you?

_Bon._ No sure Sir, he cannot be Angry, when his Friend's so happy.

_Mer._ I can't tell Boy, but I believe there's something more than
ordinary in the matter. Why should he leave the Company else? And Mrs.
_Clara_ I miss her too. Why Gentlemen, why do you suffer this?

_Ara._ Unknown to any Sir, she withdrew soon as we rise from Table.

_Mer._ Sick of the Maid perhaps; because she sees you Mrs. Bride her
Quondam Play fellow Married before her; Heh Gentlemen, heh!

_Mr. Ven._ 'Troth like enough Brother _Merry-man_.

_Mer._ Go, go, find her out for shame Gentlemen; and do not stand idle
thus, Od's bobs, when I was a Young fellow and invited to a Wedding, I
used to frisk and Jump, and so bestir my self, that I made all the
_Green-sickness_ Girles in the Room blush like Rubies. Ah, hah! I was a
brisk Fellow in those Days, I'faith, and used to Cut Capers a Yard high:
Nor am I yet so Old, but I can take a round or two still--Come, come
Gentlemen, lets in again and firk it away, shall we not?

_Spr._ With all my Heart Mr. Justice.

_Mer._ Why that's well said Mr. _Spruce_, Ods bobs it was, and I thank
you heartily.

_Spr._ Come Madam, you must along with us, without you all's nothing.

_Arab._ I'll wait on you Gentlemen; if you will give me leave Sir.
[_To_ Bonvile.

_Bon._ Oh my best Joy! This Day you may Command.

_Mer._ That's right, that's right I'faith Gentlemen! This Day she
Commands, and he for ever after. Ods bobs I have done so my self, and
hope I shall do so still. Sister _Venter_, May I presume to ask if my
Brother can say as much?

[_Exit_ Bonvile, Arab. Spruce, _and the rest of the Guests._]

_Mrs. Vent._ Yes Brother, I think he may, I freely Give him leave.

_Mer._ Observe that Brother, she freely gives you leave: But who Gives
leave the Master or the Servant?

_Mr. Ven._ You are Merry Brother, and truly you have reason, having but
one Daughter and see her Married as you would have her.

_Mer._ Yes, I have one thank Heaven! You wou'd be glad Sister you cou'd
say so, but your Barrenness does give your Husband leave (if he please)
to look for Game elsewhere.

_Mrs. Ven._ Well, well Sir, thô you jeer me, and make a scorn of my
Sterility--

_Mer._ No, no, not I Sister, I scorn not your Sterility, nor your
Husbands Virility neither.

_Mrs. Ven._ My Husband's Virility! Pray spare my Husband; for he has not
been so idle as you imagin; He may have an--Offspring abroad for ought
you know, that you never heard of.

_Mr. Ven._ Oh fye Wife, You will not make it publick will you?

_Mrs. Ven._ And yet he keeps himself within compass for all that.

_Mr. Ven._ If you love me _Winny_--

_Mrs. Ven._ Na, I say no more, but thereby hangs a Tale.

_Mer._ Say'st thou so old Girle? What and has he been stragling then?
Nay; nay I know he is a Ventersome Man; And a--Merchant of small Wares
sometimes, especially when he can get a good Commodity: I love him the
better for't I'faith, Ods bobs I do--A notable spark with a Young Wench
in a corner, Is he not? A true Chip of the old block, his Father I
warrant him--But Sister, I have something to say to you in private,
concerning my Daughter.

_Enter Nurse._

_Nurse._ By your leave Good Folks, Is Master _Venter_ the Merchant here
I pray?

_Mr. Ven._ Oh Nurse! I am glad to see thee, How does my Boy?

_Nurse._ Very well, I thank Heaven Sir! He grows bravely I assure you.
'Tis a Chopping lad I promise you, and as like your good Worship; As if
he had been spit out of your Mouth.

_Mr. Ven._ Softly, Nurse softly.

_Nurse._ I protest 'tis one of the forward'st Infants in the Universe;
Lord! how it will Crow, and Chirup like a Sparrow! I am afraid Sir he is
about Teeth, for he Dribbles extreamly, if so, Your Worship must provide
him a Silver Corral with a Whistle and Chain.

_Mr. Ven._ Well, well, he shall have everything Nurse, my Wife shall
send them to ye; in the mean time, there, there's a Piece, to buy thee a
Pair of Gloves, and so leave us, for I am busie at present, therefore
steal away behind me, and slip out at the back Door.

_Nurse._ Yes Sir, I am gone, Heavens bless your Worship, a Piece! Marry!
and that's a sufficient Charm to lye up any Nurses Tongue in
_Christendom_.

[_Ex. Nurse_

_Just. Mer._ Well well, it shall be done: Come Brother we are mist I
warrant you amongst the Young Fry, let's to 'um and, Dance till our Legs
ake again, come I'll lead the way.

_Mr. Ven._ We follow you.

[_Exeunt._

_Enter_ Friendly _Reading the Letter._

_Fr._ Heaven in its excess of Goodness, bestow'd no greater Blessing on
Mankind than that of Friendship--To Murder any one is a Crime
unpardonable! _But a Friend!--And of all Friends the nearest to my
Heart_,--'Tis such an Imposition that Hell it self 'till now cou'd never
parallel; And yet this Devil of a Woman has power over me beyond all
Virtue. I am distracted in my Thoughts, and know not what to do; yet
something must be done without delay, or else I lose her quite: And yet
I fear 'tis most Impossible, for Friendship left the World, when Justice
fled, and all who now do wear that Name are the worst of Hypocrites,

    _Like Counterfeited Coin on which is seen,
    The formal Stamp; but sordid Dross within._

_Enter_ Bonivile.

    _Bon._ My Friend alone and Thoughtful?  say for what?
    That you alone appear with Discontent,
    When all my Friends Congratulate my Bliss?
    Is it because (which I durst ne're suspect)
    Your Love to me was not intirely true?
    Or else perhaps, this Crown of Happiness
    You think Misplac'd, and Envy it not yours.

    _Fri._ Forbear such cruel Words--
    How can you entertain a Thought so Vile
    Of him whom so long you have call'd your Friend?
    May all the Blesings Heaven can bestow
    On us poor Mortals in this World below,
    Crown all your Days, and may you nothing see
    But flowing Tides of sweet Felicity;
    But I, alas!--

    _Bon._ Alas! What means my _Friendly_?
    Much hidden Grief that wretched Word portends,
    Which thus disturbs the Quiet of my Friend?
    But come disclose it to me,
    And since the Burthen is too much for one,
    I'll bear a part to ease thy troubled Breast.

    _Fri._ Oh _Bonvile_!
    Seek not to force this Fatal secret from me--

    _Bon._ I must know it, by my best hopes I must.

    _Fri._ Oh no! I cannot, Nay I dare not--

    _Bon._ How dare not trust a secret to a Friend?

    _Fri._ Oh _Bonville_, _Bonville_! Call me not your Friend,
    That Name strikes horrour to my very Soul.

    _Bon._ Ha! Art thou then a Stranger to that Name?

    _Fri._ Indeed I am, and must be so for ever now.

    _Bon._ Yet hear me _Friendly_; Deny me if thou can'st,
    Fixt as a Rock, I vow I'll here remain,
    Until I have forc'd this Dire secret from thee.

    _Fri._ Pardon me Sir, I hope you soon will hear it,
    But I----

    [_Offers to go._]

    _Bon._ Yet stay, and since intreaty can't prevail,
    By all the Friendship which you once profess'd,
    By all that's Holy, both in Heaven and Earth,
    I now Conjure thee to impart it to me,
    Or by this Life----

    _Fri._ Hold, hold, and since I can no longer hide it
    Know 'tis my Honour then which lyes at Stake.

    _Bon._ Thy Honour! How? Proceed.

    _Fri._ By chance a Quarrel happen'd to arise
    Betwixt another and my self, The Field,
    Time, Place, and all appointed,
    Nay Seconds must assist us in the Deed:
    I have relied on many seeming Friends,
    (Such as profess the bare and empty Name)
    And all refuse to venture in my Cause.

    _Bon._ Is this all?

    _Fri_ All, Is it not enough? To see my Reputation,
      (the Lifes Blood of my Soul)
    Nay all that's Dear, in Danger to be lost.

    _Bon._ Not while thy _Bonvile_ lives and wears a Sword:
    May all things frown that I wou'd have to smile,
    May I live Poor, and Dye despised by all,
    If I out live the ruine of thy Honour!
    Tell me the time my Friend?

    _Fri._ Oh, spare me that, for, if once known the time,
    You'l Cancel this your promise, and recall
    Your Friendly proffer.

    _Bon._ Away with these Excuses, come the time.

    _Fri._ At Seven this Evening.

    _Bon._ The place?

    _Fri._ _Barn-Elms_:
    Oh the fatal place! Where I too well foresee,
    The certain fall and Ruine of my Honour!

    _Bon._ No, Thou shalt not stay to forfeit thy lov'd Honour,
    Come I'm ready to assist my Friend; and will along with you.

    _Fri._ Alas. What mean you?
    Of all my Friends on you I ne're Relied;
    But sure I Dream, I Rave, by Heav'ns I'm Mad!
    My _Bonvile_ leave his Wife? And on his Wedding Day?
    His Bride whom he perhaps may ne're Enjoy?
    And all for me? O most unhappy Man!

    _Bon._ Pleasure before my Friend I'll ne're prefer,
    Nor is it lost, thô for a while, delay'd.

    _Fri._ Are you then resolv'd to go?

    _Bon._ I am as fixt in my Resolve as is the _Libertin_ in vice,
    Which Death alone can part.

    _Fri._ Yet stay, and think what it is you undertake,
    Recall this Rash and suddain Resolution,
    Least you repent, alas when it is too late.

    _Bon._ This were enough to shake a weaker Soul,
    But mine it moves not; like to a Mighty Oake,
    I'm plac'd above the Storms of Fear or Doubt.

_Enter_ Arabella.

    _Fri._ Sir, no more, the Bride,

    _Ara._ Oh, Heavens defend me!

    _Bon._ What ailes my Dearest Life?

    _Ara._ I've lost the Key of this Chain I wear about my Neck
    And of these Bracelets, Oh!  Unhappy Omen!

_Bon._ No, no, my Love; I found it as it lay at Random in your Chamber,
and fearing it might be forgot, or lost, have laid it by; 'Tis safe my
Love.

_Ara._ Indeed I'me very glad you've found it, but yet----

[sighs.

_Bon._ Yet, What my Dear? from whence proceeds that sigh?

    _Ara._ Alas, I know not!
    Some busie Genius Whispers to my Soul,
    The loss of this upon my Wedding Day
    Portend's a greater e're the Day be past.

    _Bon._ Banish such Fears, let's in and see our Friends.

    _Ara._ Indeed they all expect you; come I'll lead the way.

    _Bon._ I'll go with you. _Barn-Elms_ you say?

    [_Aside to_ Friendly.

    _Fri._ Yes that's the place, at Seven precisely;

    _Bon._ I'll meet you on the _Exchange_, and go together;
    If you are there before me, Take a turn or two.

    [_Exit_ Bonvile, _and_ Arabella.

    _Fri._ Oh my Dear _Bonvile_! Art thou then the Man?
    The only, only Man that I can call Friend,
    And only Friend that I am bound to Kill?
    A Friend, that for my sake wou'd stake his Life,
    Leave a Chast Bride and untouch'd Nuptial Bed
    For me base Man, nay worse than Savage Beast:
    The generous Lyon, never kills his kind
    They say, althô provoked to utmost rage;
    Yet I vile Monster, more ungrateful Man,
    Thus unprovoked, must kill my Brother Creature,
    And which is worse, my Dear and only Friend!
    All for the pleasure of a Foolish Woman.

      _O cruel Woman thus to Command
      A Task so hard, Yet what I can't withstand!
      Oh! thou rare Copy of the Original,
      By which free Man at first received his fall;
      For she not only wou'd her self undo,
      And all her Sex, but Damn all Mankind too._

_The End of the First Act._


ACT the Second.


SCENE the First.

_The Fields._


_Enter_ Summerfield _solus._

_Sum._ A Younger Brother! 'Tis a poor Title, and very hard to bear with:
The Elder Fool inherits all the Land, whilst we are forc'd to follow
_Legacies of Wit, and get 'um when we can_. Why shou'd the Law, by which
we are deprived of equal Portion with the First-begotten, not bind our
Fathers to cease from Procreation, and so as well deprive us of a
wretched Being, as of the Thing we cannot be without: No, no, our
Mothers ne're will consent to that, they love to groan and squall, tho
at the same time the Gallows eccho's to their Groans, and both together
labour for us. From the first we travel forth--to'thers our Journey's
End. _All this I know, yet I must forward_: To beg, my Birth will ne're
consent to; and _borrowing is quite out of date_--Yet starve I cannot,
_nor murder I wou'd not_: It must be the Highway then, the old Trade we
poor honest Rogues are forc'd too--This Place will serve for a Beginner
well enough--A Beginner did I say? Yes; for this is the very first day I
open Shop--Fortune, they say, uses to help the Bold, I hope she will be
kind to me. Ha! who have we here? A Gentlewoman well rigg'd, and only a
Servant with her, She may be a Prize worth the boarding, and faith I'll
venture hard but I'll carry her.

[_He retires to a corner of the Stage._

_Enter_ Arabella _in great disorder, looking about her, with_ Symon _her
Servant._

_Arab._ This way, say'st thou _Symon_, with _Friendly_?

_Sym._ Yes forsooth Mistress, with Mr. _Friendly_.

_Arab._ Alas! I'm tired and cannot travel further; my Heart is full of
Fear, and yet I know not why, nor can I tell why he should use me
thus,--It is not common sure for Men to leave their Brides upon the
Wedding-day: And yet I cannot tell but it may be so! O wretched State of
Marriage, and of Love, if this be Love! Here will I lie me down, and
rest a while [_Lies down._] my wearied Limbs, unused to these sad
Frights and Fears--But prethee do thou run after him, and if it be
possible o'retake him too: Tell him the strange Disorder thou dost leave
me in; and let him know my Father's Anger, his Friends Concern, and what
is more, his _Arabella_'s sad Complaint; tell him, I grieve, I faint, I
die; tell him any thing that may stay him.

_Sym._ Yes Forsooth.

_Arab._ Intreat him to return; nay, urge him all thou canst to make him
come again: Nay haste, good _Symon_, fly if thou canst, for I can stir
no further.

_Sym._ Well, well, Forsooth, I am gone.

[_Exit_ Symon.

_Arab._ Alas, how wretched and forlorn am I!

    _I she whom once so many did admire,
    Whose Wit and Charms the coldest Hearts cou'd fire!
    Now wretched Maid, and most unhappy Wife,
    In Sighs and in Complaints must end my Life.
    Abandoned by my Husband, e're enjoyed,
    With thoughts of Pleasure, yet untasted, cloy'd.
    He leaves me now to my sad Frights a Prey;
    O, my dear_ Bonvile! _whither dost thou stray?
    Unheard, alas! I make my amarous Moans;
    The Winds and Waves refuse to bear my Groans:
    Eccho her self can't suffer my Complaint,
    But with repeated Sighs grows tir'd and faint.
    Where to find him, good Heaven direct me!
    For losing him, I more than lose my self._

[_Rises, and_ Exit.

_Sum._ I must after her, she's worth my Acquaintance, and has good
Moveables about her I perceive, what e're the Ready is. The next Turning
has a most convenient Hollow for the Purpose, and there I'll make her
sure. Now Luck, or never.

[_Exit after_ Arabella.

_Reenter_ Arabella, _and_ Summerfield _after her._

_Ara._ I'm at a stand already, and know not where I am.

_Sum._ I'll direct you, Madam; Well overtaken.

_Ara._ Bless me, Sir; What are you?

_Sum._ A Man.

_Ara._ An honest Man, I hope?

_Sum._ Yes faith in some Respects, I'm very honest, but not altogether
so; I were not fit to live in the World if I were too honest, Child.

_Ara._ Alas! then I begin to fear: Pray tell me what you are?

_Sum._ Why, faith, an honest Thief.

_Ara._ How, honest, and yet a Thief? I never heard they were of Kin
before; Pray, Heaven, I find it now.

_Sum._ Indeed! It will be seen that, during the course of the work, the furnace
workmen and the hammer workmen have well defined duties to perform;
but it is not the same with the assistant, who goes from one to the
other according to requirements.

There are, however, some forges in which each of the workmen has an
assistant, since the blooms produced are heavier, and one assistant would
not suffice for the work of the two men.

In such a case the assistant at the crucibles carries the blooms to
the reheating furnace, and the assistant at the hammer carries them from
thence to the hammer.

[Illustration: FIG. 7.--WORKING THE BLOOM.]

ELABORATION OF THE ORE.

We have seen that the workman who has charge of the fire contents himself
with putting charcoal and ore alternately into the crucibles, and
that too according to the aspect of the flames, without making any
examination in the interior, in order to judge whether the work is
proceeding well.

The bloom forms gradually beneath the nozzle of the tuyere, in the
center of the bed of sand and charcoal, and is surrounded on every
side with an exceedingly pasty mass, formed of silicates of iron
and manganese (Fig. 7).

It is only at the end of the operation that the workman, by means of a
rod, causes the burning coal to drop and verifies the proper position
of the bloom by breaking the layer of scoriæ that surrounds it. This
coating he breaks off, removes the bloom with a hook, and agglutinates
with his rod the different bubbles that it exhibits, and the
assistant then carries it to the hammer.

SETTING UP A FORGE.--SELLING PRICE OF THE IRON.

To set up a forge like the one we have described, it is necessary
to count upon a first cost of about 10,000 francs.

Add to this the cost of 50 hectares of forest to furnish the charcoal that
the workmen have to make every day.

The cost of this is very variable, and floats between 2,500 and
5,000 francs per 100 hectares.

The cost the ore is only that connected with getting it but and hauling
it.

_Manual Labor_.

--The charcoal burners receive 1.25 francs per load of 90 kilos, thus
bringing the price of the product (including cost price of forest)
at 2.4 francs per 100 kilos.

The workmen in the furnace are paid at the rate of from 2.50 to
3.75 francs per day.

Those that work the hammers receive 3.75 francs, and the assistants
1.25 francs.

_Carriage of the Forged Iron_.

--The iron is carried from the forge to the places of consumption
on the backs of mules, and the cost of carriage is, on an average,
0.25 franc per 100 kilos and per kilometer.

_Selling Price_.--The selling price is very variable, and depends principally
upon the distance of the place where sold from the different forges
that surround it.

At Ouro Preto the price varies between 45 and 50 francs per 100
kilos.

The following is a _resume_ of the data which precede:

Cost of first establishment.................. 10,000 fr.

Charcoal per kilogramme...................... 2.40 { Furnace men....
2.50 to 3.75 Manual labor per day { Hammer men............. 3.75 {
Assistants............. 1.25 Carriage of forged iron per kilometric
ton..... 2.50 Selling price per 100 kilos................ 45 to 50

THE STEAMER CHURCHILL.

We give engravings of the Churchill, a vessel lately built to the
order of Mr.

Walter Peace, London agent to the Natal Harbor Board, by Messrs.

Hall, Russell, and Co., Aberdeen.

She was designed by Mr. J.F.

Flannery, consulting engineer to the Board, for special service at
Natal.

The Churchill has been constructed so as to be capable of towing
into or out of harbor over the bar in any weather, of acting as a
very powerful fire engine, of carrying a large amount of fresh water
for the use of other ships, of landing troops from transports which
the harbor is too shallow to admit, of recovering lost anchors and
cables, of which there are a large number off the coast, and of
acting in time of need as a torpedo or coast defense vessel; she
was launched on the 16th August, and is likely to fulfill all these
requirements.

[Illustration: THE NEW STEAMSHIP CHURCHILL.]
The principal dimensions of the vessel are: Length between perpendiculars
115 feet, breadth, extreme, 22 feet, depth of hold 11 feet, and maximum
draught with full bunkers 7 feet 6 inches.

There are four water-tight iron bulkheads forming five compartments;
the stern is built very full to protect the propellers.

Accommodation is arranged on deck for the captain aft with two spare
berths, mate and two engineers amidships, while six white hands
will occupy the forward forecastle, and six Kaffirs the after one. For
towing purposes she is fitted with one main and two skip hooks
secured to the main framing; towing rails are placed aft, while
bitts are put on one each quarter, will be seen by referring to the
deck plan.

The vessel is propelled by twin screws 6 feet 8 inches in diameter
and 13 feet 6 inches pitch; these are of cast iron, have four blades,
and are driven by a double pair of compound inverted direct acting
engines (see Figs. 4 to 7) which are capable of developing 600
indicated horse power, and whose cylinders are 19 inches and 34
inches in diameter with a stroke of 2 feet.

The condensers form part of the engine frame, and have guide faces cast
on for the crosshead shoes.

They are fitted with gun metal tube-plates, and each contain 516
tubes, 3/4 inch in diameter, which have an exposed length of 6 feet
5 inches, and give a total cooling surface of 650 square feet.

The air and circulating pumps are bolted to the back of the condensers,
and are worked by levers from the engine crosshead.

Each engine has one feed and one bilge pump attached to the air pump,
and worked by the same lever.

The plan of the engines shows the pump arrangement very completely.

[Illustration: ENGINES AND BOILERS OF THE NEW STEAMSHIP CHURCHILL.]
The steam is supplied by two circular return tube boilers, 9 feet
6 inches in diameter and 10 feet long, with two furnaces in each.

The boilers, which are of steel throughout, except the tubes, are
placed longitudinally, and are fitted with two pairs of the
Martyn-Roberts patent safety valves.

They have one steam dome between them. The total heating surface is 1,700
square feet, the total steam space is 330 cubic feet, and the working
pressure 100 lb. per square inch.

The fire pump is a Wilson's "Excelsior," with 10 inch steam cylinder
and 8 inch water barrel.

This powerful pump is in a special compartment of the fore hold, and will
draw water from the bilge, sea, or either hold.

A steam windlass and a double-handle winch are on deck as shown. On trial
trip the engines of the Churchill indicated a maximum of 645.5
horse power, driving the vessel 10.495 knots per hour.

The vessel is remarkable for diversity of uses, for heavy engine
power in a small hull, and for general compactness of arrangement.

THREE-WAY TUNNELS.

Mr.

T.R. Cramton, who at the Southampton meeting of the British
Association suggested a method of tunneling which, under certain conditions,
seems of excellent promise, brought forward a suggestion at Southport
for the construction of three-way tunnels.

Now, the undoubted aim of all engineers is economy of construction and
the securing of permanent advantages.

Mr. Crampton maintains that the suggested system will give these,
that three tunnels of, say, 17 ft. diameter, can be constructed cheaper
than one of 30 ft. diameter. After describing Sir J.
C. Hawkshaw's scheme for the ventilation of long tunnels, the
three-way scheme was discussed.

Three separate tunnels of 17 ft. diameter each, or 227 ft. area, are to
be connected by large passages about midway of their length. These passages
are without valves; in fact, free air passages. Between these midway
connections and the ends, say again midway between, is formed a branch
at right angles either above or below with separate openings from
the branch into the other tunnels, such openings being provided
with doors or valves quite clear of the main tunnel, any two of
which may be closed, thus separating at this point the corresponding
tunnels from the third.

The branch is to be led to any convenient position where the exhustion
apparatus can be placed.

If two of the tunnels are left open to this branch, and the third one shut
off from it by closing the doors, the vitiated air will be drawn
from the two working tunnels, through the connecting branch, while
fresh air will be partly sucked down the vertical shafts through
their open ends and partly at the center tunnel, which is supplied
by forcing air down the vertical shaft in communication with it, a
stop or door being placed just outside of the bottom of the shaft
so as to compel the air to flow to the center of the tunnel.

It will be observed that no trains are running in this air tunnel
so long as it is so used; there are similar doors for the working
tunnel, but they are kept open, unless either of them is required
to be made into an air tunnel, so that the passing trains run no
risk of running into the doors.

By means of the doors above mentioned, any one of the three tunnels
can be used as a fresh-air tunnel, in which the men doing the repairs
to the road would be clear of the traffic, while the other two are
used for the traffic, as well as outlets for the mixed impure gas
and air.

If a breakdown of a train occurs in any one tunnel, that tunnel can
at once be converted into a fresh-air one, while its traffic is
transferred to the one previously used for air, thereby avoiding
delay.

The system described for splitting the air and drawing off the noxious
gases is very similar to that described by Mr. Hawkshaw at Southampton.
The valves and other details being added, to make the system
applicable to three tunnels, it will be obvious that other modes
of ventilation may be adopted.

In order to reduce the number of men working in the tunnel it is
proposed, if found practicable, not to adopt the ordinary ballast
and cross sleepers, but to substitute the longitudinal timber system,
the timbers to be secured to brickwork or concrete, forming a part
of the tunnel lining, placing efficient elastic material between
the foundation and longitudinals for their whole area, also between
the rails and sleepers.

An open drain is formed between the rails; by this plan any water
accumulating flows over smooth surfaces through small channels
into a drain, the tunnel on each side being dry.

The saving of labor in repairs, if this system can be employed, is
so evident that a large amount of money might be expended in
endeavoring to discover a suitable elastic material for the purpose.

There are data on many long viaducts sufficient to justify experiments
being made on the subject, and it is not unreasonable to expect that
suitable material may be met with. In very long tunnels nothing should
be omitted tending to reduce the number of men working in them.

The opinion was expressed that in tunnels passing through solid materials,
and proper foundations being made for the longitudinals to rest upon,
with good elastic material placed between the rails and sleepers and
foundations, one-half of the men employed on the ordinary cross
sleeper road resting on ballast would be saved, more particularly
as the repairs are effected in pure air free from the traffic as
explained.

The estimate as to the cost of this system was upon the dimensions given
by Sir J. Hawkshaw, and the following gives the comparison:

The quantity of excavation and brickwork or concrete in each case will
be as follows: Single tunnel: 30 ft. diameter lining, 3 ft. thick, with
the brickwork forming the air passage = to 36.5 cubic yards per
yard forward.

Excavation to outside of brickwork 36 ft. diameter = to 113 cubic
yards per yard forward.

Three tunnels 17 ft. diameter and 18 in.
brickwork. Brickwork lining for three tunnels = 24.5 cubic yards
per yard forward.

Excavation outside brickwork for the same 105 cubic yards per yard
forward.

It is assumed that three 17 ft. tunnels are stronger, more conveniently
formed, and involve less risks in construction than one of 30 ft.
diameter; at the same time there is no difficulty in making the
latter.

The above shows the saving in the three tunnels of 23 per cent. in
brickwork, and about 7 per cent. of earthwork, compared with one
of 30 ft.

With regard to ventilation, it is well known that the power
required to force air along passages is practically as the cube of
the velocity; and as the area of the air passages in the single
tunnel is 106 ft. with speed ten miles per hour, and that of one
of the 17 ft.
diameter is 227 ft., or rather more than double, giving only five
miles per hour velocity, it follows that the power for this portion
would be eight times less.

That for the working tunnels would be practically the same, the
velocities being nearly alike in both cases, which would be about
2½ miles per hour--the 30 ft. having an area of 470 ft., the two
single ones together about 450 ft.

Upon the face of it the system deserves a trial. A full consideration of
the scheme by engineers preparing plans for new tunnels would no
doubt throw further light upon the subject and be of interest
wherever such work is contemplated.

    MONT ST. MICHEL.
    

Every one who has the slightest regard for historical monuments, who
values mediæval architecture, or cares in the least degree for the
beautiful and the picturesque, must heartily sympathize with M.

Victor Hugo in his protest against the proposed scheme for uniting
the wonderful island of Mont St.

Michel with the mainland by means of a _causeway_, and possibly a
_railway_!

Those who know Mont St.

Michel well, and, like the writer, have spent several days upon the
island, cannot but feel that such a scheme would not only be a
frightful disfigurement, but would entirely destroy all the
associations and the poetry of the place.

Practical people will say, "Modern improvement cannot stop in its
march forward to consider poetical associations and mere artistic
whims and fancies."

Now, this would be a possible argument if Mont St. Michel were a busy,
thriving town, a commercial port, or the seat of great industries;
but in a case where the only trade is that of touting, the only
visitors sightseers, the only "stock-in-trade" mediæval remains,
surely, from a practical point of view, anything which will injure
these antiquities will really destroy the importance of the island,
as its _only_ value consists in its wonderful historic and artistic
associations.

[Illustration: MONT ST. MICHEL, NORMANDY.]
The first glimpse of Mont St. Michel is strange and weird in the extreme.
A vast ghostlike object of a very pale pinkish hue suddenly rises
out of the bay, and one's first impression is that one has been
reading the "Arabian Nights," and that here is one of those fairy
palaces which will fly off, or gradually fade away, or sink bodily
through the water.

Its solemn isolation, its unearthly color, and its flamelike outline
fill the mind with astonishment.

Mont St.

Michel is by far the most perfect example of a mediæval fortified
abbey in existence, with its surrounding town and dependencies, all
quite perfect; just, in fact, as if time had stood still with them
since the fifteenth century.

_Ara._ How! base ungrateful Man, do you suspect my Faith? Nay then,
Father, Uncle, and Gentlemen, where are you?

_Enter all as before._

_Mer._ How now, how now! What's the matter, Girl?

_Ara._ For shame, will you not entertain your Kinsman here a little
better: you leave him here alone, as thô you despised his Company.

_Mer._ Is that all? I thought the Bridegroom had been return'd: Sir,
pray pardon this Rudeness; But indeed I had quite forgot you, quite
forgot you, as I hope to be sav'd: But what makes you tremble, Sir, are
you ill dispos'd.

_Ara._ Think you he hath not reason to be ill-disposed at this cold
[_Aside to Justice_ Merryman.] Entertainment? for my part I blush for
shame.

_Spr._ Come pray, Sir, shake off this Dulness, and participate of our
Mirth, Od's nigs do.

_Sum._ I am very well, Sir, I thank you, only the Gentleman is a little
under a Mistake.

_Mer._ It may be so, Ay, ay, it may be so; I vow I thought you had
trembled, but I believe it might be my own Hand; you must pardon me, I
was stiffer once.

_Sum._ Sir, your humble Servant.

_Mer._ But, Gentlemen, what think you of an Adventure?

_Spr._ Adventure whither?

_Mer._ Why, to the _East-Indies_? I have a Vessel, Gentlemen, called the
_Sea-Horse_, bound thither, and to morrow I do expect her to sail. Now,
Gentlemen, if you'l venture, ye shall have fair Dealing, that I'll
promise you. And for the French, you need not fear them, for she is a
smart new Vessel: Nay, she hath a Letter of Mart too, and twenty brave
roaring Boys on both Sides her, Starboard and Larboard: And I intend to
go as far as _Marget_ down with her, 'twill be as good as Physick to me.

_Spr._ A very good Motion, Sir, I begin, there's my ten Pieces.

_Sum._ And, Sir, if a proffer'd Love may be accepted, be pleased to take
my ten Pieces with you.

_Mer._ Your's above all the rest, Sir.

_Ara._ That's kindly said, Sir, and I thank you: Now pray venture Ten
more for my sake.

_Sum._ Alas, Madam, it's a younger Brother's Portion.

_Ara._ At my Request, Sir, venture the other Ten; if you want, I'll
supply you with as many more.

_Sum._ With all my Heart then: Come, Sir, if you please, I'll double
mine: So now she's got her Gold again, and I am now no Thief, (_aside_)
Sir, I have a Suit to you,

[_To_ Merryman.

_Mer._ You may command it, for I am always at your Service: But pray
your Pleasure?

_Sum._ My Request, Sir, is, to have the Honour of keeping you Company to
Sea, for I have a great desire to see _Marget_.

_Mer._ Sir, I shall be very happy in your good Company.

_Ara._ I hope you will be both better acquainted e're you return; and by
that time your Kinsman may be here to make you more welcome.

    _And for the Gold at my Request you lent,
    I'll double it to give you more content._

    Sum. _Why shou'd I fear, since she is prov'd so just?
    I'll quit my Trade: Now_ Jack Catch _do thy worst._

_Exeunt._

_The End of the Second ACT._


ACT the Third.

_A Wood_


_Enter_ Bonvile _and_ Friendly.

_Bon._ Come my brave _Friendly_, I think we are here the first: Your
Enemy is not yet i'th Field; let's walk a Turn or two, perhaps by that
time he may arrive.

_Fri._ I'm very confident that he's here already.

_Bon._ Thy Looks, me-thinks, speak Conquest sure thy own; an ardent Rage
has kindled both thy Cheeks.

_Fri._ Like a red Morning, Friend; which still foretels a stormy Day to
follow--And now I well observe your Face, me-thinks it waxes pale,
there's Death in it already.

_Bon._ How, _Friendly_, do you then take me for a Coward? My Face look
pale, and Death in it already? By Heav'n, shou'd any but my _Friendly_
dare to tell me what thou hast said, my Sword shou'd ram the base
Affront down the curst Villain's Throat. But you are my Friend, and I
must only chide your Error. But prethee tell me who is it you are to
fight with, for as yet I am ignorant both of the Cause and Person.

_Fri._ Ha, his Name! Did you enquire his Name?

_Bon._ Yes.

_Fri._ I dare not yet reveal it for fear of----

_Bon._ For fear of what?

_Fri._ O Confusion! I know not what to say!

_Bon._ How, afraid to tell his Name? Then I begin to doubt the Justice
of your Quarrel.

_Fri._ Too well you may, for by yon' setting Sun, that Globe of heavenly
Light I swear, I come to kill the only Man that strives to save my
Life--Man did I say? Nay more than common Man, for those the World
abound with; but such a Man besides, all this vast Land affords not.

_Bon._ By this your large Encomium of your Friend, I'm afraid 'twas Wine
first made your Quarrel, and thereupon this Challenge did ensue.

_Fri._ O no! I call the Powers above to witness, that in all the Course
of our unhappy Friendship, I to my knowledg never did receive the least
Affront or Injury from him.

_Bon._ How came this Challenge then?

_Fri._ O dear Friend, the noblest that Man cou'd ever boast of:
[_embraces him_] When first my rigid Fate threw on me this Command to
fight, I had recourse to many whom I always thought my Friends; but when
the Touchstone of my Danger try'd 'em, I found 'em like the cursed Fruit
of _Sodom_, fair without, but rotten at the Heart: But then I found out
_Bonvile_, my only dearest Friend. _Bonvile_ no sooner heard of my
Engagement, but flew unto my Succour with as much Bravery, as a great
General hastned by Alarms, marches to meet the Foe: You left your
Nuptial Bed perhaps to meet your Death. O unheard-of Friendship! My
Father gave me Life, 'tis true; but you, my Friend, support my Honour.
All this for me, while I, ungrateful Man, thus seek your Life: For to my
eternal Horror be it spoke, you are the Man whom I come here to kill.

_Bon._ Ha!

_Fri._ Too true alas! there read the Warrant for your Death.

[_Gives him the Letter._]

_Bon._ 'Tis a Woman's Hand.

_Fri._ Yes, and a bad One too, they all speak fair, write foul, but mean
worse.

_Bon._ How! kill me? Sure, I dream, and this is all Delusion, or else
thou dost it only to try thy Friend.

_Fri._ O, from my Soul, I wish it were no more. But read, read on, see
how I'm fetter'd in a _Circe's_ Charms--I love beyond Imagination, love
even to Madness, and must as madly do a Deed will damn me to the hottest
Flames of Hell.

_Bon._ And woo't thou kill thy Friend for such a Woman?

_Fri._ Alas! I must, you see I am commanded, commanded too by Love; Love
more powerful than all the Sacred Ties of Friendship, therefore draw,
and guard thy self. [_Draws._

_Bon._ Not I by Heaven! What wou'dst thou have me draw and kill my
Friend?

_Fri._ There thou stab'st my Soul. O where, where is now my Resolution
fled? A fatal Blast has struck me; a sudden Horror shot me thrô the
Heart; a Trembling seiz'd my Knees, that I can hardly stand, and all my
Vital Powers methinks seem dead; yet Love's the Fire must kindle all
again, therefore I charge thee draw, or naked as thou art, I will assail
thee.

_Bon._ I am defended against all that thou canst do, in having Justice
on my Side, and Friendship too to back it.

    _But since Humanity now bears so sway,
    To this unguarded Breast come make your way._

Strike home be sure.

[_Opens his Bosom._

_Fri._ That were a barbarous Murder.

_Bon._ How can the Effect prove different from the Cause? Or how can any
thing but damn'd Barbarity ensue a Woman's much more damn'd Design? Who
wou'd expect Reason from one that raves, or hope for Mercy in a Tyger's
Den? Believe me, _Friendly_, all this may sooner be; Mercy may sooner
dwell among the Savage Wolves and Bears, than in a Woman's Breast.

_Fri._ O, my too rigid Fate, to place me thus on such a dangerous
Precipice, that wheresoe're I turn my self for help, I see my Ruin still
before mine Eyes.

[_Seems to weep._

_Bon._ [_Pausing._] Stay--The Command which thy _Medea_ sent thee, was
to kill thy only dearest Friend, was it not?

_Fri._ Alas! it was.

_Bon._ Then here, all Friendship dies between us; thus hast thou kill'd
thy Friend, and satisfied that infernal Hag, thy cursed Mistress, who
thus commanded thee: Away, I say, begon, and never see me more.

_Fri._ Ha!

_Bon._ Yes, base ungrateful Wretch, farewel, (_Offers to go_) --Yet
stay, and since that Sacred Tie of Friendship's broke, know thou, most
vile of Men, that _Bonvile_'s now thy Enemy; therefore do thou draw and
guard thy spotted Life.

_Fri._ How, Friend!

_Bon._ Friend didst thou call me? On forfeit of thy Life that word no
more; the very Name of Friend from thee, shall be a Quarrel: How can I
tell but that thou lovest my Wife, and therefore feign'd this damn'd
Design to draw me from her Arms?

_Fri._ How! wrong thy Wife? O no, I never had a Thought so vile! Yet you
must forgive me, indeed you must, by all that once was dear to me; and
what I dare not mention more, by Love and Honour, I implore thy
Pardon--Still art thou deaf to my Complaints?--Nay, then upon my Knee, I
will enforce thy Pity. Behold me, _Bonvile_, prostrate at thy Feet,
crawling for Mercy, swimming in Tears, and almost drown'd with Shame;
extend thy Arm to help me, as thou'rt a Man, be God-like in thy Nature,
and raise me from the Grave; turn thy Eyes on me, and sink me not with
Frowns; O save me, save me, or I fall for ever.

_Bon._ As soon shall Heav'n reverse the Fate of Hell, as I recal what I
have said, or plant thee in my Breast again.

_Fri._ Nay, then I am lost to thee, and all the World besides.

[_Rises._

_Bon._ Thou are indeed for ever lost to me; see what a miserable Wretch
thy Folly now has made thee: A Creature so far below my Pity, that I
despise and scorn thy base Submission, and will never hear thee more,
more.

_Fri._ Say but thou hast forgiven me, and I will ask no more.

_Bon._ I never will.

_Fri._ O cruel _Bonvile_!

_Bon._ More barbarous _Friendly_: Hold off, or I will use thee like a
Dog, tread thee to Earth, and spurn thee like a Slave, base as thou art.

_Fri._ Still thou art my Friend----

_Bon._ Thou ly'st, I have abjured the Name.

_Fri._ Let me but go with thee.

_Bon._ Not for the World; I'de rather venture my self with Crocodiles,
catch the last dying Gasps of some poor Wretch infested with the Plague,
than trust my self with thee.

    _Farewel, I leave thee with the greatest Curse,
    Condemn'd to Woman, Hell affords no worse._

[_Exit, breaking from him._

Friendly solus, _rising in a Passion._

_Fri._ Death and Destruction, am I thus despised! Condemned to Woman's
Lust, and scorn'd by Man. By _Bonvile_ too, after imploring, like a
School-Boy, at his Feet--My Blood boils high, and scalds my very Heart!
My inward Grief calls on me for Revenge, and I am all on fire! O that I
had the proud _Bonvile_ here now at my Feet, I'de use him worse than he
did me before.

    _But since that open Force yields no Relief,
    Private Revenge shall ease my swelling Grief.
    With Thoughts of Jealousy I'll fill his Soul,
    Which shall its Powers of all their Rest controul.
    Thus for a Woman I've begun a War,
    And for her sake must damn my Soul like her._[Exit.


SCENE the Second.

_Enter_ Nurse, Compass, _and his Wife._

_Nurse._ Indeed you must pardon me, I can't let ye see the Child; to
tell you the Truth, I am commanded to the contrary.

_Comp._ Commanded! Prethee who commanded thee?

_Nurse._ The Father.

_Comp._ The Father, Why who am I?

_Nurse._ Not the Father sure, the Civil Law has found it otherwise.

_Comp._ The Civil Law found it otherwise! Why then the Uncivil Law shall
make it mine again, I'll be as dreadful as a _Shrove-Tuesday_ to thee;
for I'll besiege thy squalling catterwauling Castle, with my Friends the
Mob, and gut thy stinking Nursery, but I'll both see and have my Child.

_Nurse._ Harkee, Goodman Swabber, say but half so much again, and I'll
call the Constable, and lay Burglary to your Charge. You wou'd not be so
hot if the Enemy were in View, nor if you had to do with any body but a
poor innocent Woman, so you wou'd'nt.

_Peg._ Good Husband be patient, and let me alone with her: Come, come,
good Nurse, let him see the Boy.

_Nurse._ Indeed I dare not Goody _Compass_: The Father first you know
delivered me the Child, and order'd me to let no body see it. He pays me
well and weekly for my Pains, and therefore I'll do as be bad me, so I
will.

_Comp._ Why thou white Bastard-breeder; Is not this Woman here the
Mother?

_Nurse._ Yes, I grant you that.

_Comp._ Do you so? Well, and I grant it too; And is not the Child then
my own by the Wives Copy-hold?

_Nurse._ The Law must try that.

_Comp._ The Law! What then you think I'll be but its Father-in-Law? I
tell thee, all the Wit and Law twixt _Cuckolds-Point_ and
_Westminster-Hall_, shan't keep my own dear Flesh and Blood from me, I
warrant you that. No an't does, I'll be hanged at the Main-yard: Why,
who, dost think, uses to get my Children but my self?

_Nurse._ Nay, I can't tell; you must look to that, for my part I ne're
knew you get any.

_Comp._ Say'st thou so? Why, look you, do but put on a clean Smock, and
try me, if thou darst, I'll hold thee three to one I get thee with Child
before I leave thee: Heh! what say'st thou?

[_Offers to lay hold on her._.

_Nurse._ I'll see you hang'd first--Nay, pray be quiet, and don't offer
to spoil my Milk. Lord, you are as boisterous as my Husband was the
first Night we were married: Pray, Goody _Compass_, take off your Cur,
or else he'l bite me.

_Peg._ No never fear him, Nurse, he's not so furious I assure ye.

_Enter Mr._ Venter _and his Wife._

_Nurse._ O! here's my Master, the Child's Father, now talk with him.

Mr. _Ven._ Good morrow Neighbour, good morrow to ye both.

_Comp._ Both! Good morrow to you and your Wife too, if you go to that.

Mr. _Ven._ I wou'd speak calmly with you, Friend, if you think fit.

_Comp._ I know what belongs to Calm, and a Storm too; and if you please,
a cold word or two wi' you.

Mr. _Ven._ With all my Heart.

_Comp._ I understand that you have ty'd your Mare in my Ground.

Mr. _Ven._ My Mare, Friend, nay I assure you, 'twas only my Nag.

_Comp._ Your Nag? Well your Nag then let it be: Harke, Sir, to be short,
I'll cut off your Nag's Tail, if e're I catch him there again.

Mr. _Ven._ Pray hear me, you are too rough to maintain----

_Comp._ I say, Sir, you shall maintain no Child of mine; my Wife does
not bestow her Labour for that purpose.

Mr. _Ven._ You are too passionate--I will not maintain----

_Comp._ No marry shall you not.

Mr. _Ven._ The Deed I have done to be lawful, I have repented it, and
given Satisfaction to the Law, my Purse has paid for't; therefore I
wou'd treat milder with you if you'd be pleased.

_Comp._ Yes, yes, I am very well pleased, and shall be better pleased if
you can serve me so still: For, look you Sir, one of these Days I shall
to Sea again, you know where my Wife lives; yet you'l but lose your
labour, for get as many Children as you can, I assure you, you shall
keep none of them.

Mr. _Ven._ I think you are mad.

_Comp._ Why, if I am Horn-mad, what's that to you?

Mr. _Ven._ Nay then, since you are so rough, I tell you plainly you
are--a----

_Comp._ A what? What am I, heh?

Mr. _Ven._ A Coxcomb.

_Comp._ A Coxcomb! a Cuckold you mean, and you a Fool for your pains.

Mr. _Ven._ The Child is mine, I am the Father of it, and will keep it.

_Comp._ Yes if you can, I know you will. But pray tell me, is not my
Wife the Mother? You may be as far from being the Father as I am, for my
Wife's acquainted with more Whore-masters besides your self; ay, and as
crafty Merchants too, let me tell you that.

_Peg._ No indeed Husband, I had to do with no body else, 'twas he begot,
indeed and indeed now. Yet for all that, the Child's mine, I bred it and
bore it, and I'll have it and keep it, so I will.

Mrs. _Ven._ Pray hold there Mrs. Jill-flurt, the Child's my Husband's,
and he shall have it, or I'll tear your Eyes out, ye Whore you.

_Comp._ Good Words, Mistress; d'ye hear, give good Words you'd best, or
I shall tell you your own.

Mr. _Ven._ I'll have no more to say to ye, the Law shall determine it;
in the mean time Nurse keep the Child for me, there, there's Money for
thee.

[_Gives her Money.

_Comp._ There's Money for me too, keep it for me, Nurse; give him both
thy Duggs at once, I pay thee for the right one, Girl.

_Nurse._ I have two Hands, you see Gentlemen; this does but show ye how
the Law will hamper ye; even thus you'l be used, Gentlemen, if you go to
Law.

Mr. _Ven._ It can't be helpt, for I won't lose my Right.

_Comp._ Nor I mine for all you're a Merchant.

Mrs. _Ven._ Nor I mine for all I did not bear it.

_Peg._ Nor I, tho but a poor Sailer's Wife.

Mr. _Ven._ Well, fare ye well, we shall meet in another Place--Come
_Winny_.

[_Exit_ Venter _and his Wife._

_Comp._ Ay, ay, I'll meet you when and where you dare, and do your
worst, I fear you not: By the Lord _Harry_ the World's come to a fine
Pass, that we must go to Law for our Children. No wonder the Lawyers are
all so rich, yet e're the Law shall have a Limb, a Leg, a Joint or Nail
of this same Boy,

    _'T shall cost me more than a whole Child in getting,
    Some win by play, and standers by with Betting._

[Exeunt.


SCENE the Third.

_Enter_ Spruce, Arabella _with a Letter in her Hand_, Clara, _Mr._
Venter, _and Mrs._ Venter.

Mr. _Ven._ From whence came that Letter, Niece?

_Ara._ From _Putney_, Sir, and from my Husband.

Mr. _Ven._ And pray be free; Does he tell ye the Cause of his leaving
you so abruptly on his Wedding-day?

_Ara._ Yes; Sir, yet this had been sufficient to have let me known what
he is gone about, without the formal Addition of an Epistle.

_Spruce._ That, why what is that I pray Madam?

_Ara._ His Will, Sir, wherein he makes me his sole Executrix.

_Spr._ Will! why what the Devil does he mean, seriously I can't find it
out?

_Ara._ Why, Sir, he's gone to fight.

_Spr._ How fight, Madam! On my Soul then I believe _Friendly_'s Second.

_Ara._ You're in the right, he is so, and I am lost for ever!

_Cla._ O foolish _Friendly_, this thy Mistake has made me the most
wretched of Woman-kind! Such variety of Thoughts load my afflicted
Breast, that I know not what to think: I rave, am mad, not knowing what
my Folly may produce; I fear for both, for both my Heart does bleed.

_Ara_. Miserable Maid! nay, miserable Wife! but much more miserable
Widow! O my dear _Bonvile_!

_Spr._ Duce take me, if e're I saw a Company so Phlegmatick in all my
Life: Mr. _Venter_, prethee let's have a Song, to pass away the Time,
and put Life into the Bride.

Mr. _Ven._ With all my Heart, Mr. _Spruce_: Here, who waits?--Call in
the Musick, and desire 'em to oblige the Ladies with a new Song.

[_Servant Enter and Exit._ ]

_Cla._ Your self, Sir, you mean?

_Spr._ Nay all of us I protest.

Mr. _Ven._ Ay, ay, all of us.

_Enter Musick and others who sing._

A Dialogue set by _Seignior Baptist_.

_After the Song enter Justice_ Merryman, Summerfield, _and three or four
Sailers._

_Mer._ Daughter, Daughter! Where's my Daughter? I say, Where's my
Daughter? O Girl, I have the best News to tell you----

_Ara._ What of my Husband, Sir?

_Mer._ No, no, of your Cousin, Girl, of your Cousin.

_Ara._ What of him, Sir?

_Mer._ Such a Cousin, Girl, such a dear Cousin he is, as _Alexander the
Great_, if he were alive, might be proud and boast of.

_Ara._ You're welcome here again, Sir; You've made but a short Voyage,
pray what occasion'd your Return so speedily?

_Sum._ Madam, I render you ten thousand Thanks; Your Generosity and
Goodness has wholly made me yours; I am the humblest of your faithful
Admirers.

_Ara._ Forbear such lavish Gratitude; You'r too profuse in your
Acknowledgment of your small Favours. But pray be brief, and let me know
the happy Occasion of this your sudden Return, I long methinks to hear
it.

_Sum._ Madam, you may command me--Not to molest the Company with the
Recital of every vain and needless Circumstance; 'twas briefly thus.
Scarce had we passed by _Marget_ on our Course, when on a sudden, from
the Top-mast head, a Sailer cries, All hands Aloft, three Sails ahead:
With that we rumidg and clear our Deck, our Gun-room arm'd, and all
things now are ready for a Fight. The Ships before descried, with
warlike Stems cut the resisting Waves, whilst from their Pendants
fluttering in the Air, we found they were three _Dunkirk_ Privateers;
they having made our English Cross advanced, salute us with a
Broad-side, to make us strike and yield: But we, who ne're knew as yet
what 'twas so cowardly to yield, and not regarding their unequal Odds,
fell boldly on, returning Fire for Fire. The Engagement then grew
desperate, for they on either Side fired in amain, whilst we withstood
their Force. At length they boldly grappled, and laid us close aboard,
and we as bravely beat them off again.

_Mer._ But now, Daughter, mark what follows, for that's worth all,
I'faith it is; therefore go on, dear Cuz, go on.

_Sum._ Sea-room at length we got; when (as Fate wou'd have it) an
unlucky Shot struck both the Captain and Lieutenant dead. Then we began
to fear, and all our noble Hearts were trembling with despair.

_Mer._ No, no, not all Daughter--But you shall hear more--Ods bobs you
shall.

_Sum._ How cou'd it be otherwise, when both our Commanders now were
lost? therefore to strike was all the Talk----

_Mer._ Ay, ay, now Daughter, now comes the Play, the other was only the
Prologue.

_Sum._ But Fortune favouring, and the Wind springing a fresh Gale, we
got clear off and try'd to make a running Fight.

_Mer._ Ay, but Cuz, how did we do all this? by whose Order and
Direction?

_Sum._ Pardon me, Sir, 'twas of so small Moment, that already it has
slipt my treacherous Memory.

_Mer._ Oh, ho! has it so! Ha, ha, ha! But it has not mine, I thank you,
no marry has it not, as you shall hear--Then he, with an undaunted
Spirit, started up amongst the Sailers, and----

_Sum._ Nay pray Sir----

_Mer._ By the Foot of _Pharaoh_ I'll not be balkt; he, I say, with an
Heroick Voice cried out, Courage brave boys, Charge and Discharge amain;
come I'll supply your fall'n Captain's place. At this blest News they
all fell on again, with ten thousand times more Fury than before:
Victory, Victory, was all their cry, whilst he my Cousin here, whom I
shall ne're forget, for by the Lord, methinks, I see him in the Fight
this very Instant, now running this way, now running that way, now down
to the Gun-room to encourage those that fought there; now upon the Deck
again, still crying out, Fear not, brave Boys, the Day will soon be
our's.

_Sum._ O pray, Sir, let me intreat you to forbear, you make me ashamed,
I protest, to hear you.

_Mer._ Ashamed, say you? Ha, ha, ha!

_Ara._ Good Sir, go on.

_Mer._ I will, I will--At length the proud French swallowing too many of
our English Balls, two of 'em very fairly cried, Your Servants
Gentlemen, farewel, and down they went. The other having lost most of
her Men, resolved to leave us; but we being too nimble, overtook her,
clapt some Men aboard, and brought her in a Prize: And this my brave Man
of War here, was the first that boarded her with Sword in Hand.

_1 Sailer._ Of all this I was an Eye-witness.

_2 Sailer._ And so was I.

_3 Sailer._ And I, and all of us.

_Mer._ Yes, and many more stout Boys besides.

_Spruce._ Sir, we are all indebted to your Valour; such Voyages as
these, from small Venturers, in time may make us great Merchants.

_Mer._ Well, never was Fight better managed before, that's certain.

_1 Sail._ No, never, never!

_2 Sail._ Better, say you? No nor half so well.

_3 Sail._ If it were in our Power, we'd make him Admiral, so we wou'd.

_Sum._ Gentlemen, 'tis to your Valours all, that I am indebted for the
Honour I have gain'd: And that I may not seem wholly ungrateful, there,
there's something in token of my Thankfulness.

[_Gives 'em Money._

_1, 2, 3 Sailers._ Heaven bless your Worship.

_Ara._ Come Cousin, we'l withdraw into the Parlour: And if these honest
Friends will be pleased to drink what our House affords, they shall be
welcome.

_1 Sail._ Thank you Mistress with all our Hearts.

[Exeunt _all but Sailers_.

_2 Sail._ Well, this Mr. _Summerfield_ is a brave Fellow, Gadzooks he
is.

_3 Sail._ Ay _Tom_ so he is; had it not been for him, we had all been
taken on my Conscience.

_1 Sail._ On my Soul and so we had: O if you had but seen him when he
boarded the _Monsieur_, 'twou'd have made you laugh 'till you had split
your Sides. He came up to the Captain o'this fashion with a Slap--ha!
and gave him such a back-handed wipe, that he cut off his Head as
genteely, as tho he had served seven Years Apprenticeship to't.

_Enter Servant with a Bowl of Punch._

_Serv._ Gentlemen, Mr. _Summerfield_ desires ye to be merry, and has
sent you this to drink his Health.

_1 Sail._ O, the Lord bless him, he's a fine Gentleman, and so pray tell
him, and withal give him our hearty Thanks; Dost hear Boy?

_Serv._ Yes, yes, I will.

[_Exit._

_2 Sail._ What is't Brother?

_3 Sail._ Punch by this Light!

Omnes. _Hoo-ra; Hoo-ra; Viva_ Mr. _Summerfield, Viva, Hoora._

[The first Sailer takes the Bowl of Punch, walks in state round the
Stage, and sings; the others all follow.]

    Micras, aged fifty-seven
      years, solemnly sworn,
    purged of malice and partial
    council, examined and interrogate: Depones, That it is now about
four years ago, since he heard it reported in the country, that the
two men, Clerk and Macdonald, the panels, were the people who
murdered Serjeant Davies, and a little time after Elizabeth Downie
was married to Clerk the panel: The deponent happened to be in
Alexander Downie her father's house, and then saw upon her finger
a ring, pretty massy, having a lump upon it pretty large; and the
deponent got the ring into his hand, and the lump appeared to the
deponent to be something in the shape of a heart: And the deponent
asked Elizabeth Downie how she came by that ring?

to which she answered, that she had bought it from one James Lauder,
a merchant: The deponent replied, that he thought it was cheap and
worth more money, and that it was reported in the country, that the
said Elizabeth Downie was wearing rings of Serjeant Davies's, but
he never saw her have any but that one: And further adds, that he
never heard any other suspected of the murder of Serjeant Davies
but the panels, except once, that it was suspected to have been
done by caterers; and he also heard, for a twelvemonth after Serjeant
Davies was amissing, that he had deserted; nevertheless the general
report or belief of the country was, that the two panels had murdered
him.

years ago, after Serjeant Davies was amissing, his servant-maid,
Isobel Ego, the immediate preceding witness, being sent to the hills
of Inverey to look for some horses, when the said servant-maid
returned, she told the deponent's wife, as she told him, that she
had come home richer than she went out, having found in the hill a
silver-laced hat: That his wife, upon seeing the said hat, had no
peace of mind, believing it to be Serjeant Davies's hat, and desired
it might be put out of her sight:
That the deponent, who was abroad, having come home, took the hat
and put it below a stone near to a burn which run by his shealling,
where his wife then was: That the hat was carried away from under
the said stone, but who it was that carried it off the deponent
knows not.

the miln of Inverey, upon that day that Serjeant Davies was amissing:
That between the midday and sunset he heard three gunshots, but
cannot tell from what particular place the sound came: That the
three shots were pretty near one another, and all within less than
a quarter of an hour.

Depones, That the Hill of Christie, libelled, is about a mile's distance
to the entrance thereof from the place where he then was, and that
it will be at least three miles from there to the place where the
bones were found.

Depones, That he was told that Isobel Ego, a preceding witness,
found a hat in the Hill of Christie, which she brought home and
delivered to her master: That he heard her master hid it at the
Burnside, under a stone: That some time thereafter some of the
bairns of Inverey found the said hat, and brought it to his the

returned to the garrison the afternoon of that day on which the
Serjeant was amissing; the report thereon ceased, and about ten
days thereafter it was reported that the Serjeant had been murdered
by two young men about Inverey.

And about a year and a half after the Serjeant had been amissing,
he heard Duncan Clerk the panel named as one of them, but never
heard any thing of Alexander Macdonald, the other panel, till he
was committed prisoner to the Castle of Braemar in September last.

Compeared JOHN GRANT, in Altalaat, aged forty years and upwards,
married, solemnly sworn, purged of malice and partial council,
examined and interrogate: Depones, That both the panels lodged in
his house upon the night of the twenty-seventh of September, one
thousand seven hundred and forty-nine: That next morning they
breakfasted, after the sun rising, with him; and as he was going
to a Michaelmas fair, when he came out of his house, he looked and
saw the two panels at his door, each having a gun in his hand, and
they told him that they intended to go a deer hunting, but did not
mention to what place: That the deponent accordingly went to the
fair, and returned in about four days home, and then heard that a
soldier who had been upon some of the hills was amissing, and in a
very short time heard it was Serjeant Davies: That at first it was
rumoured that some of the Serjeant's own men had killed him; and
afterwards that he had been killed by some outlaws; and after that
it was clattered that the panels had killed him: Depones, That the

going the next morning in quest of horses for leading in corn,
without mentioning from where.

_Causa scientiæ patet._ And this is the truth, as he shall answer
to God.

JOHN GRANT, son to the said John Grant in Altalaat, aged twenty
years, solemnly sworn, purged of malice and partial council, by the
sworn interpreter aforesaid, and by him interrogate: Depones, That
he knows the panels, and that they lodged with his father the night
of the twenty-seventh of September, one thousand seven hundred and
forty-nine:
That next morning the panels, each of them having a gun, and Duncan
Clerk a grey plaid about him, went up the water to the hill of
Gleneye, which is about a mile and a half distant from the hill of
Christie:
That the road they took was not the direct road to the hill last
named; and before they went they said they were going a deer hunting
and for horses to lead in their corns: That three or four days after
this, they heard that Serjeant Davies was amissing, and that he was
killed in the hill of Christie; but the last part of this he did
not hear till some time, a year or two thereafter.

Macgillies, a preceding witness, in Duncan Clerk, the panel's house:

knows not if it was gold, with a knob upon it of the same metal;
which ring she frequently observed on the finger of the wife of the
said Duncan Clerk.

And further depones, That the said knob was bigger above and smaller
below, and shaped something like a heart.

JOHN GROWAR, in Inverey, aged fifty years and upwards, a widower; who
being solemnly sworn, purged of partial council, and interrogate,
Depones, That upon the 28th of September, 1749, the deponent having
gone to a glen called Glenconie, to bring home his horses to lead
in the corns, he met with Serjeant Davies, of whom he had some
acquaintance before; and he had at that time a good deal of
conversation with him, particularly with relation to a tartan coat
which the Serjeant had observed the deponent to drop, and after
strictly enjoining him not to use it again, dismissed him, instead
of making him prisoner: That the deponent went home with his horses,
and saw no more of the Serjeant, who was alone; and that their
meeting was about an hour after sunrising, to the best of the
deponent's knowledge:
That some time thereafter, about four years ago, he was told by
Alexander Macpherson _alias_ M'Gillies, a former witness, that the
Serjeant's ghost had appeared to him, M'Gillies, and had desired
him to bury his, the Serjeant's, bones, and to bring Donald
Farquharson, also a former witness, along with him; but M'Gillies
at that time did not mention the place where the bones were to be
found, but afterwards told the deponent that the Serjeant's bones
were found in the place to which the ghost had directed him; and
one day the said M'Gillies and the deponent being in the hill
together, he, M'Gillies, pointed to him the place where they were
found, which was not far from the place in which he had formerly
met Serjeant Davies, upon the 28th of September aforesaid; and that
two years ago, in labouring time, the said M'Gillies told him that
the said ghost came to M'Gillies's master's house, and the door
flung open, and took M'Gillies out of the house, and told him that
the panels had been his murderers.

Depones, That about two years ago he had a conversation with M'Gillies,
who told him, that one day coming from the hill with Duncan Clerk,
the panel, then his master, and another time when in bed, he had
a conversation with the said Duncan concerning Serjeant Davies's
murder, and all the answer Duncan made was, What can you say of an
unfortunate man?

Depones, That about ten or eleven years ago, Duncan Clerk, the
panel, was said to have stolen some sheep from one Alexander
Farquharson, in Inverey, and there was a Sheriff-court held upon
that matter at the Mill of Achindryne, in which nothing was found
against the said Duncan, but John Ewes alias M'Donald was fined,
and the deponent became cautioner for him, that he should never
speak about it again.

_Causa scientiæ
patet._ And this is the truth, as he shall answer to God.

ANGUS CAMERON, in Easter Finart, Rannach, aged thirty years and upwards,
solemnly sworn, purged of malice and partial council, by Duncan Campbell,
sworn interpreter, and by him interrogate, Depones, That he was
in Braemaar four years past at Michaelmas last; that is, in the
year 1749: That about an hour and a half before sun-set on the 28th
of September, he being on the hill of Galcharn, on the side thereof,
saw a man in a blue coat, with a gun in his hand, with a hat which
had a white edging about it, he knows not whether it was silver or
not; and saw other two men, one of whom was the panel Duncan Clerk,
who he had seen upon former occasions, and another man of a lower
stature than the said Duncan Clerk, coming up the hill towards the
first mentioned man, who was distant from him, the deponent, about
a gunshot, upon, or near the top of a hill opposite to him, the
deponent, the name of which he does not know, he being a stranger
in that country; that there was another man along with him, the
deponent, named Duncan Cameron, and that they were waiting there
for other travellers, and his said companion is dead about three
years ago: Depones, That he saw Duncan Clerk, the panel, and his
companion, whom he did not, nor does not know, meet with the man
clad in blue, as aforesaid; and after they had stood for some time
together, he saw Duncan Clerk, the panel, strike at the man in blue,
as he thought, with his naked hand only, upon the breast; but, upon
the stroke, he heard the man struck cry out, and clap his hand upon
the place struck, turn about, and go off: That the panel Duncan
Clerk and the other man stood still for a little, and then followed
after the man in blue, and saw him, the said Duncan and the other
man, each of whom had a gun, fire at the man in blue: That the two
shots were very near one another; and immediately upon them, the
man in blue fell: That Duncan Clerk, the panel, had upon him a grey
plaid, with some red in it, whom he saw that same day, and his
companion along with him, (but spoke to none of them,) about mid-day,
and that they passed him as he was lying upon the same hill; and
that both times that same day, that he had occasion to see the said
Duncan Clerk and his companion, he was lying in a little hollow
upon the side of the said hill of Galcharn, in such a manner, as
he thinks, neither the said Duncan Clerk, or his companion did see
him: And depones, That there was no long heather in the said hollow
where he was lying:
Depones, That after the man in blue fell, in manner above mentioned,
the panel Duncan Clerk, and his companion, went up to him; and as
it was the deponent's opinion the man was dead, he saw them stoop
down, and handle his body; and while they were so employed, he, the
deponent, and his companion, got up, and made off: Depones, That
he did not mention any thing of the premises to any body for nine
months or a twelve month, and then he spoke of it to one Donald
Cameron, and to Duncan Cameron, a different man from him above
mentioned, who advised him to say nothing of it, as it might get
ill-will to himself, and bring trouble on the country; some people
that he told it to said, that people would not believe him, but
rather think he was telling lies:
That it was six months after what he saw, and has deponed upon,
that he heard that Serjeant Davies was amissing.

And being interrogate for the panels, depones, That he came to the
said hill of Galcharn, and lay down in the hollow about two hours
after sun-rising; and depones, That he and his companion were, the
night before the twenty-eighth of September aforesaid, in Glenbruar
Braes, which is about ten miles distant from the hill of Galcharn;
and that he left these braes about the end of said night; and that
the travellers that he expected to pass that day were Donald Cameron,
who was afterwards hanged, together with some of the said Donald's
companions from Lochaber.

Davies was amissing, Angus Cameron, a preceding witness, told the
deponent that he saw Duncan Clerk, and another person unknown, shoot

be a serjeant or officer; upon which the deponent said he did not

serjeant in Braemaar was amissing, whose name he thinks was Davidson,
or something like that, Angus Cameron, a preceding witness, told
the deponent that he had seen Duncan Clerk the panel, and another
man along with him, shoot a man, like a gentleman or an officer,
upon a hill in Braemaar: That upon this the deponent told the said

nor to have such a report raised of the country; and the deponent
at the same time advised Angus to keep the thing secret, and to
speak no more on the subject.

That the panel, Duncan Clerk's father, his house is within less
than a quarter of a mile of the deponent's house: That upon the
afternoon of that day in which Serjeant Davies was amissing, as he
thinks, or at least the afternoon of the day following, he cannot
be altogether positive which, he saw Duncan Clerk, panel, come from
the hill to his father's house, with a gun in his hand, and a sort
of grey plaid about him: That he does not remember that he saw him

Long I shall not keep a pother,
      Like a senseless whining Beau;
    If you won't I'll court another
      Who will never say me no._

    Woman:

    _Friend, your self, nor Humour neither
      With my Fancy disagree,
    Yet I must find clearer Weather
      Er'e I venture out to Sea.
    Court another at your Pleasure
      Win her in the Honey-moon,
    She may chance repent at leisure,
      For believing you too soon._

    Man:

    _Leave your damn'd Fantastick Trials,
      Which procure a Lover's Pain,
    Pox upon these sham-Denials,
      'Tis but spending time in vain.
    With Embraces happy make me,
      Nature fram'd you to be kind;
    Kiss me, and the Devil take me
      If I ever change my Mind._

    _I'll pursue the good old Fashion,

_The End of the Fourth ACT._


ACT the Fifth.


_Enter_ Arabella _on one Side_.

Summerfield _meeting her from the other_.

_Ara._ Mr. _Summerfield_, I now am truly happy, my Prayers at last are
heard; and Heaven has restored my Husband to my Arms.

_Sum._ I just now heard the joyful News, and thought to have been my
self the welcome Messenger of his Return, but find I'me come too late;
have you seen him?

_Art._ No; as yet I have not.

_Sum._ 'Tis somewhat strange!

_Ara._ Others perhaps may judg it so, but my uncommon Joy for his
Return, admits no other Thought, but those of Transport for his Safety.

_Sum._ O happy _Bonvile_! How I admire and wonder at thy Choice!

_Enter_ Friendly.

Madam, a Wife like you, exceeds the greatest Blessing sure on Earth.

_Fr._ The nearest way to a secure Revenge, is private Malice, which,
like _Aside._ a Spark long lying hid amongst neglected Ashes, by the
least Blast of Wind becomes it self a Flame--Ha!, who have we here?
Thrice blest Occasion! which thus have offered me at once the Scope of
my revengeful Wishes. 'Tis _Arabella_ and her Darling _Summerfield_, one
who, in the Bridegroom's Absence, is grown thus intimate with his
beloved Bride. A strong Foundation on which I'll now erect a brave
Revenge; I'll step aside and observe them.

[_Retires to one side of the Stage._

_Ara._ Sir, I hope he'll soon be here, and return the Kindness you have
shown me; so I take my leave, with hourly expectation of a much-long'd
for Husband.

_Sum._ And I, with a Gratitude never to be forgotten, kiss your fair
Hand, and hope that all things will answer your Expectation. [_Exit_
Arabella.

_Fri._ Ay, 'tis so, now must I counterfeit a friendly Face to make a
farther Discovery.

[_Aside._

Sir, your humble Servant: without Offence, may I be so bold as to beg
the Favour of your Name?

_Sum._ The Question I must confess is somewhat familiar, and in my
Opinion improper for a Stranger at first sight; but yet I ne're disown'd
it to a Gentleman--'tis _Summerfield_.

_Fri. Summerfield!_ Sir, I kiss your Hand;, and must congratulate your
good Success, but more admire your Valour. Had we many such noble
Commanders on board our Fleet, we need not fear it where e're it sails.

_Sum._ Pray, Sir, stretch not your Love into Flattery, 'twill make me
then suspect your Kindness. And the Author of this Story was too much my
Friend I see, since he has given you this so very partial Account, the
more to augment my Fame.

_Fri._ O! that's your Modesty, Sir: But if I might be so happy as to be
honour'd with your Acquaintance----

_Sum._ Sir, the Honour (if any) would be wholly on my Side; therefore I
desire to know your Name.

_Fri._ _Friendly_, Sir.

_Sum._ An Acquaintance; I suppose, of Mr. _Bonvile's_.

_Fri._ One that thinks himself much honour'd in being stiled his Friend.

_Sum._ I have often heard your Name indeed before; but till now Fortune
never afforded me the sight of you.

_Fri._ You of all Men ought to bless Fortune, who still has been
indulgent to you on all Occasions; and scatter'd her Favours on you,
with as prodigal a Hand as thô you were her sole Care and only Minion.

_Sum._ What mean you, Sir? Again you exceed the Bounds of Love and
Friendship; I never thought any of _Bonvil's_ Friends cou'd be guilty of
so base and vile a thing as Flattery: But, pray, unfold your meaning.

_Fri._ 'Tis this; I just now saw you part with the Bride, with such
courteous Actions, as spoke no small Esteem in her kind Favour; and
therein I think you the happiest of Men.

_Sum._ How!

_Fri._ Mistake me not, I only as a Friend applaud your Happiness, bless
the Influence of your kinder Stars, and praise your Fortune that hath
given you this sweet Occasion.

_Sum._ What Occasion, Sir?

_Fri._ Of being serviceable to the fair Virgin Bride in her extreamest
need, after her being so unkindly left, nay, on her Wedding Day, by an
ungrateful Husband, in doing her those neglected Duties, her Youth and
Beauty justly did demand.

_Sum._ On my Life some Plot against the Bride: I'll sound him 'till I
find the very Bottom--[_Aside._]--Sir, you are merry: But suppose the
Case your own, wou'd you have miss'd so tempting an Occasion?

_Fri._ No, Sir, they're too precious to be omitted: But I hear you two
call Cousins, comes your Kindred by the _Merryman's_ or the _Bonvile's_?

_Sum._ Neither! we were wholly Strangers 'till of late, and 'tis a word
of Courtesy only interchange'd between us for some private Reasons.

_Fri._ This goes as I cou'd wish. [_Aside._]

_Sum._ I desire you not to grow too inward with me, on so short an
Acquaintance: Not that I'de have you think the Lady of so base a
Disposition to grant me any thing beyond the Rules of Decency and
Honour. The only Favour I e're receiv'd from her, was a Present of those
Bracelets she wears about her Arms, and that Chain of Gold and Pearl she
has about her Neck; all which either of us may own without a Blush.

_Fri._ How, the Chain and Bracelet, say you! Those were the first Tokens
of her Husband's Love.

_Sum._ Methinks you look concern'd at what I've said; yet I have said no
more than what I am obliged in Honour to maintain, and will: therefore I
hope, as you'r a Gentleman, you'l not turn Informer.

_Fri._ O pray think not so poorly of me.

_Enter a Servant who whispers_ Summerfield.

_Sum._ Tell her I'le wait on her immediately.

[_Exit Servant._

Sir, some Business of Importance calls me hence; therefore some other
time I hope I shall have the Happiness of enjoying your Company longer.

[_Exit_ Sum.

_Fri._ Sir, your humble Servant.
Tell her I'll wait on her immediately, said he; this must be _Arabella_
that he's going to: Better still.

    _The Work's begun, now I am made or lost;
    He runs the best who holds out to the Post:
    And all the Comfort in Adversity,
    Is to see others as miserable as me._

Who have we here? Old _Merryman_! As I live 'tis he!

_Enter Justice_ Merryman.

_Mer._ O Master _Friendly,_ you're happily returned: But where's my
Son-in-Law?

_Fri._ Alas, Sir, the unhappy _Bonvile_ is----

_Mer._ Is, is, what is he? Heh! speak; is he living, or is he dead; or
what's become of him?

_Fri._ O! that I had the Marble _Niobes_ Heart! Or that I had suck'd the
Milk of Wolves and Tigers; so that I might have told, without the least
remorse of Sorrow, what now I dare not, nay, I cannot speak, for fear at
once I melt my self in Tears, and break your aged Heart.

[_Seems to weep._

_Mer._ Then I suppose he's killed; say, is he not? Hast thou inticed him
from his Bride for this, thou inhumane Wretch? Yet speak, and tell me
truly, for I'm prepared to hear the worst of Ills; Is he then slain?

_Fri._ No, Sir, but dangerously wounded.

_Mer._ Not mortally, I hope; but whereabouts is he so desperately
wounded? In his Arms, his Legs, or Body?

_Fri._ Neither, Sir, but in as perfect Health as when he left you.

_Mer._ Strange! sure thou art all o're a Mystery, and form'st these
Riddles to try my Wit.

_Fri._ No, Sir, for all I have said, you in effect will surely find I
told you he was wounded, did I not?

_Mer._ Yes, you did.

_Fri._ And so he is.

_Mer._ But where, whereabout, I ask you once again?

_Fri._ I see you force the unwilling Secret from me--Why, he's wounded.

_Mer._ He's wounded, he's wounded, but where, where is he wounded?

_Fri._ In his Fame, Honour and Reputation, more mortal than a thousand
fleshy Wounds.

    _For such slight Baubles, Cures are oft obtain'd;
    But injur'd Honour ne're can be regain'd._

_Mer._ How! how! how's this? wounded in his Honour, fay'll thou? Tell me
the Villain that has defam'd him, and this good old Sword shall slit the
Rascal's Wind-pipe.

_Fri._ O, Sir, your Daughter, your Daughter, Sir----

_Mer._ Ha! what's that? what's that? is she injur'd too?

_Fri._ No, no Sir, my falling Tears quite drown my feeble Voice, I
cannot utter what I fain would speak--Your Daughter's false, false to
her _Bonvile_! And by the help of her beloved _Summerfield_, has robb'd
my Friend of all he cou'd call Dear, I mean his Fame.

[_Seems to weep._

_Mer._ A Pox o' your Crocodile's Tears. Why, Sirrah, Sirrah, do you call
my Daughter Whore? Hey, Swords and Daggers, Blunderbusses and Pistols,
shall I bear this? Hark you, you my Friend, and no Friend, what a Kin do
you take me to be to this Gentlewoman, Heh?

_Fri._ Her Father, Sir.

_Mer._ Audacious Villain, O that I had thee in some private Corner,
where none you'd either see or hear us, this Sword shou'd justify my
Daughter's Honour; I'de Whore you with a Pox to you, so I wou'd.

_Fri._ Your Pardon, Sir, I only did inform you as a Friend, that by your
fatherly Admonitions, you might refrain her from her undecent Course.

_Mer._ Pox o' your friendly Intelligence.

_Fri._ The Jewels which her Husband did present her, as the first Sign
and Confirmation of the happy Contract, she to my certain Knowledg has
given to----

_Mer._ To whom, to whom thou wicked Slanderer? tell me, Sarrah, quickly,
quick, quick.

_Fri._ To _Summerfield_.

_Mer._ Ha, ha, ha, the Fool makes me laugh; Ha, ha, ha, why 'twas but
just now that I saw e'm on her Neck and Arms.

_Fri._ She was no Woman, had she not the Sense to get them against her
Husband's coming.

_Mer._ But pray tell me, how is't possible that she cou'd part with 'em,
when they are lock't on, and the Key with her Husband?

_Fri._ O, Sir, that's no Question to be ask'd in these Times: Women
_have found a way to make use of other Keys besides their Husbands: And
no doubt but_ Summerfield _has got a Key will open your Daughter's lock
as well as_ Bonvile's.

_Mer._ Sirrah you lie, you lie Sirrah; and I'le tell thee thou ly's,
again and again, so I will. Nay, and I were to pay a 100 Pounds for
every Lie I give thee, as Men do Twelve-pence for every Oath they swear,
I wou'd spend all the Thousands I am worth, in giving thee the Lie. 'Tis
likely indeed, that such a brave Gentleman as _Summerfield_, that fought
at Sea like a Dragon to save my Life, should shorten my Days on Land in
ruining my Daughter; therefore once more I tell you you Lie.

_Fri._ 'Tis very well.

_Me._ Do you hear Sir, have you told this Lie to any body else but me?

_Fri._ I am no Informer, Sir.

_Mer._ Why then for fear you shou'd, do ye see, draw, [_Draws_] Draw, I
say, I am not so old but I can make a shift to cut your Throat still;
I'le spoil your Carking, I'le warrant ye.

_Enter_ Bonvile _and_ Clara.

A Pox on't, here's my Son-in-Law come to hinder me, Duce take him cou'd
he not stay a little longer? D'ye hear Sir, begon, leave this Place
immediately, or I'le--I'le--I'le--Gad I cou'd find in my Heart, so I
cou'd, but be gone.

_Fri._ _Bonvile_ here with _Clara_ too, excellent. This goes to
_Arabella_, and may it encrease the Storm.

[_Exit_ Frie.

_Bon._ My Father in Anger.

_Mer._ O Son, Son, Son! dear Boy, welcome home, Od's bobs you are.

_Bon._ I humbly thank you, Sir; but am sorry to see you so disturb'd.

_Mer._ Nothing, nothing, only Mr. _Friendly_ and I have had a Word or
two, that's all, that's all.

_Bon._ About my going with him, I suppose; but that's past, and I hope,
Sir, you'l be so kind as at my Request to pardon him.

_Mer._ Indeed Son it was something else; By the Lord _Harry_ I can't
forbear laughing at the Coxcomb, Ha, ha, ha; He told me, Ha, ha, ha,
that one _Summerfield_, a very honest Fellow as ever liv'd, is grown
exceeding familiar with my Daughter, your Wife.

_Bon._ Ha! my Wife.

_Mer._ Yes, your Wife, and that he had received Love-Tokens from her.

_Bon._ How, Love-Token from her!

_Mer._ Aye, aye, Love-Tokens I call'd 'em when I was a young Man: Nay,
the Rogue was so impudent to tell me, that she had given him those
Jewels which are lock'd about her Neck; Ha, ha, ha.

_Bon._ The Jewels about her Neck, said you?

_Mer._. Aye, what ails you Man that you change Colour so? 'Tis all a Lie
Boy I warrant thee: And hadst thou not come just in the Nick of Time, I
think o' my Conscience I shou'd have cut his Throat.

_Bon._ As I will your Daughters if I find her false: Death, Hell, and
Furies, am I made a Monster already?

_Cla._ What, Sir, are you return'd for this?

_Mer._ Hark y' son, hark you; suppose that this Mr. _Friendly_ shou'd
have a secret Inclination to your spouse, d' ye see; and therefore, by
reason he can't obtain his Desire, possesses you with Jealousy to make a
Breach 'twixt you and your Wife. Od's bobs, I don't know, I can't tell
what shou'd be the meaning of his carrying you away on your Wedding-Day,
else, heh, Son, heh.

_Cla._ Has the Italian Plague then infected you, that you stand thus
unmov'd?

_Enter_ Summerfield _leading_ Arabella.

But see here's your Bride.

_Bon._ And her beloved Adulterer with her! Death and Damnation, must I
stand still and see this?

_Mer._ Hey day! what the Matter now?

_Ara._ _Bonvile_ here with _Clara_! Alas too true I find what before I
scarce dar'd to think was so. Is _Bonvile_ then a Traitor, and false to
_Arabella_?

[_Aside._

_Cla._ Madam, at last I've found the pretious Jewel that you so long
have sought in vain.

[To _Arab._

_Ara._ Wear it your self Madam, I lost it, and it must be mine no more.

EDITION
The Tragedie of Tancred and Gismund.

Compiled by the Gentlemen of the Inner Temple, and by them presented before
her Maiestie.--Madam, I sent you my Will, did you receive it.

_Ara._ Yes, I did.

_Bon._ Let me see it.

_Ara._ You shall.

[_Exit_ Ara.

_Bon._ Sir, I desire a Word or two in private with you,

[_to_ Summer.

_Sum._ With all my Heart, Sir.

_Mer._ What's that, what's that, I'll have no Whispering, Gentlemen.

_Enter_ Arabella _with the Will._

_Ara._ There's your Will, Sir.

[_Throws it down,_ Bonvile _takes it up._

_Bon._ 'Tis well now as you've chang'd your Mind, I'll change this too,
and find another to supply your Place: There's no harm done, the
Marriage is not yet consummated, and you are free to enjoy any, so am I.

_Ara._ As you please for that: A Man may make a Garment for the Moon,
count all the Stars which twinckle in the Skies, or empty the vast
Ocean, Drop by Drop, sooner than please a Mind so light, so various as
yours.

Descending, we wandered through the inclosed garden, and came to a
little building in a corner, on entering which, we found the two
statues of Tam and Sutor Wat,--ponderous stone-work enough, yet
permeated in a remarkable degree with living warmth and jovial
hilarity.

From this part of the garden, too, we again beheld the old Brigg of Doon,
over which Tam galloped in such imminent and awful peril.

It is a beautiful object in the landscape, with one high, graceful
arch, ivy-grown, and shadowed all over and around with foliage.

When we had waited a good while, the old gardener came, telling us that
he had heard an excellent prayer at laying the corner-stone of the new
kirk. He now gave us some roses and sweetbrier, and let us out from his
pleasant garden. We immediately hastened to Kirk Alloway, which is
within two or three minutes' walk of the monument.

A few steps ascend from the road-side, through a gate, into the old
graveyard, in the midst of which stands the kirk.

The edifice is wholly roofless, but the side-walls and gable-ends are
quite entire, though portions of them are evidently modern restorations.
Never was there a plainer little church, or one with smaller
architectural pretension; no New England meeting-house has more
simplicity in its very self, though poetry and fun have clambered
and clustered so wildly over Kirk Alloway that it is difficult to
see it as it actually exists.

By-the-by, I do not understand why Satan and an assembly of witches
should hold their revels within a consecrated precinct; but the
weird scene has so established itself in the world's imaginative
faith that it must be accepted as an authentic incident, in spite
of rule and reason to the contrary.

Possibly, some carnal minister, some priest of pious aspect and
hidden infidelity, had dispelled the consecration of the holy edifice
by his pretence of prayer, and thus made it the resort of unhappy
ghosts and sorcerers and devils.

The interior of the kirk, even now, is applied to quite as impertinent
a purpose as when Satan and the witches used it as a dancing-hall;
for it is divided in the midst by a wall of stone-masonry, and each
compartment has been converted into a family burial-place.

The name on one of the monuments is Crawfurd; the other bore no
inscription.

It is impossible not to feel that these good people, whoever they may
be, had no business to thrust their prosaic bones into a spot that
belongs to the world, and where their presence jars with the emotions,
be they sad or gay, which the pilgrim brings thither.

They shut us out from our own precincts, too,--from that inalienable
possession which Burns bestowed in free gift upon mankind, by
taking it from the actual earth and annexing it to the domain of
imagination.

And here these wretched squatters have lain down to their long
sleep, after barring each of the two doorways of the kirk with an
iron grate!

May their rest be troubled, till they rise and let us in!

Kirk Alloway is inconceivably small, considering how large a space
it fills in our imagination before we see it.

I paced its length, outside of the wall, and found it only seventeen
of my paces, and not more than ten of them in breadth.

There seem to have been but very few windows, all of which, if I
rightly remember, are now blocked up with mason-work of stone.

    One mullioned window, tall and narrow, in the
    eastern gable, might have been seen by Tam O'Shanter, blazing with
devilish light, as he approached along the road from Ayr; and there
is a small and square one, on the side nearest the road, into which
he might have peered, as he sat on horseback.

Indeed, I could easily have looked through it, standing on the
ground, had not the opening been walled up.

_Bon._ I have heard the Story, Sir, already; and _Friendly_, you I
pardon too, for Enemies in War take all Occasions to undo each other;
yet tho I am your Enemy, I'll be generous still, and make you Master of
your wish'd for Mistress.

[_To_ Clara.]

Come, Madam, receive this worthier Passion of your _Friendly_, whom I
know you both admire and love.

[_Gives her to_ Friendly.

Next I must obtain your Pardon for my Rashness.

_Sum._ Sir, 'tis what I first ought to have begg'd of you: And that the
World may'nt tax this innocent Lady of a Crime to her purest Thoughts
unknown, I'll here begin my Story from my first Acquaintance to this
happy Hour.

_Mer._ Prithy do.

_Sum._ The first time that I e're beheld her Face, I wou'd have robb'd
her.

_Mer._ Ah Rogue! What, a Thief, a Thief, what wou'd you have robb'd her
of?

_Sum._ Not her Honour, I assure you, Sir, but only of those Jewels which
she wears.

_Mer._ Ods bobs, thou wert an honest Thief, for that I faith he was.

_Sum._ They being fast, I cou'd not get 'em off without some Harm and
Pain to her: which for the _Indies_ I'd not have done. And she, in
answer to my Civility, brought me home, and ransom'd them with the full
Price in Gold, (with which I made my Venture) and the more to hide my
Shame, she honour'd me with the Title of her Kinsman.

_Mer._ Ay, ay, and so she might well; for she was a little cunning Thief
too, to steal the Gold she gave you from her Husband; 'twas all his now,
but that's no matter, proceed.

_Sum._ The rest you know already, Sir.

_Mer._ Ay, so I do, ods bobs I do, thy Valour my brave Boy, thy Valour,
for which I'll do for thee, that thou shalt never need to rob again I
warrant thee; ods bobs I will. But come, come, we lose time, for we have
another Wedding yet to be perform'd, but that shall be done within.

    Sum. _Then farewel all ye treacherous Paths of Vice,
            Which lead Men blindfold to their End,
            In time like me repent you that are wise,
            And by Restraint your vicious Courses end._

    Ara.    _Were I to ask of Heaven its greatest Bliss
            On Earth, it cou'd bestow not one like this.
            After a Storm the Sun still shines most bright,
            And from the Chaos sprung the purer Light._

    Bon.    _A Day like this sure yet has never been,
            Wherein such various Changes e're were seen.
            Fortune to Day that work'd my Overthrow,
            Has made me happy in a Minute now.
            Bless'd with a vertuous Wife my Days I'll spend,
            And ne're trust Man, lest I mistake my Friend._


EPILOGUE,

Spoke by the City-Bride.


      _You met with good Intention to be witty,
    And rally the Grave Cuckolds of the City;
    But disappointed of your Recreation,
    I in your Looks can read the Play's Damnation.
    Lord! how ye stare to find an honest Bride,
    A thing you think a Monster in_ Cheapside.
    _Whither you boast that you so often come,
    And leave your footmen to perform at home.
    Yet 'tis no little Comfort t' us howe're,
    You oftner bring th' Estate than get the Heir.
    Unjustly therefore you your Fortune blame,
    She's kinder to your Blood that to your Name._

      _After all this, I know you think it Pity,
    That I shou'd break the Custom of the City:
    I hear a Beau cry, 'tis some damn'd Mistaker;
    A_ Cheap-side _Vertue, City Cuckold maker.
    This is a Fault no Gentleman can pardon,
    It gives_ Cheapside _the Sins of_ Covent-Garden:
    _We must refine on Vice, and take new Measures,
    Since dull chain'd Cits invade our darling Pleasures._

      _Take my Advice, employ at home your Backs,
    Or_ Locket's _Revels may revenge_ Pontack's:
    _This Cuckolding to you's a losing Trade,
    That pay for making, and for being made.
    The Ladies will my Character excuse,
    And not condemn a Vertue which they use._

    _If any here be guilty of Transgression,
    'Tis of Necessity, not Inclination:
    They'd be contented in their proper Houses,
    Cou'd they reform their unperforming Spouses.
    Yet if some wanton Appetites there be,
    How many are there that can fast like me.
    Those are enow, if I have their Applause,
    The Poet has his End, and I my Cause.

The next instant a volley of minnie balls was scattering the snow
all around us.

I tried to walk, but my pants and boots were stiff and frozen, and
the blood had ceased to circulate in my lower limbs.

But Schwartz kept on firing, and at every fire he would yell out,
"Yer is yer mool!"

Pfifer could not speak English, and I reckon he said "Here is your mule"
in Dutch.

About the same time we were hailed from three Confederate officers,
at full gallop right toward us, not to shoot.

And as they galloped up to us and thundered right across the bridge,
we discovered it was Stonewall Jackson and two of his staff.

At the same time the Yankee cavalry charged us, and we, too, ran back
across the bridge.

STANDING PICKET ON THE POTOMAC

Leaving Winchester, we continued up the valley.

The night before the attack on Bath or Berkly Springs, there fell
the largest snow I ever saw.

Stonewall Jackson had seventeen thousand soldiers at his command.
The Yankees were fortified at Bath.

An attack was ordered, our regiment marched upon top of a mountain
overlooking the movements of both armies in the valley below.

About 4 o'clock one grand charge and rush was made, and the Yankees
were routed and skedaddled.

By some circumstance or other, Lieutenant J. Lee Bullock came in command
of the First Tennessee Regiment.

But Lee was not a graduate of West Point, you see.

The Federals had left some spiked batteries on the hill side, as
we were informed by an old citizen, and Lee, anxious to capture a
battery, gave the new and peculiar command of, "Soldiers, you are
ordered to go forward and capture a battery; just piroute up that
hill; piroute, march.

Forward, men; piroute carefully." The boys "pirouted" as best they
could.

It may have been a new command, and not laid down in Hardee's or
Scott's tactics; but Lee was speaking plain English, and we understood
his meaning perfectly, and even at this late day I have no doubt
that every soldier who heard the command thought it a legal and
technical term used by military graduates to go forward and capture
a battery.

At this place (Bath), a beautiful young lady ran across the street.

I have seen many beautiful and pretty women in my life, but she was
the prettiest one I ever saw.

It was a stump. I tell the
above, because it illustrates a part of
many a private's recollections of the war; in fact, a part of the
hardships and suffering that they go through.

One secret of Stonewall Jackson's success was that he was such a strict
disciplinarian.

  He did his duty himself and was ever at his post, and he expected
  and demanded of everybody to do the same thing. He would have a
  man shot at the drop of a hat, and drop it himself. The first
  army order that was ever read to us after being attached to his
  corps, was the shooting to death by musketry of two men who had
  stopped on the battlefield to carry off a wounded comrade. It was
  read to us in line of battle at Winchester.

SCHWARTZ AND PFIFERThe poet has done many things well; and he has done
  few things better than this ballad in the quaint, old-time style,
  with its nervous energy and sonorous rhythm, wherein one hears
  the trampling of waves and crashing of timbers.

  From the small size of the windows and the diminutive proportion
  of its turrets, it would seem to possess
  "'Windows that exclude the light, And passages that lead to
  nothing.'"
Upon the unhappy seclusion of the _royal_ architect, the works were
suspended, and it now remains unfinished.A modern tourist, in "A
  Morning's Walk from London to Kew," characterizes the new palace
  as "the _Bastile palace_, from its resemblance to that building,
  so obnoxious to freedom and freemen. On a former occasion," says
  he, "I have viewed its interior, and I am at a loss to conceive
  the motive for preferring an external form, which rendered it
  impracticable to construct within it more than a series of large
  closets, boudoirs, and rooms like oratories."

to fall, and became quiet.
