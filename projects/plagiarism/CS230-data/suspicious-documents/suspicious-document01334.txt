004:037 For it is in this that you see the real meaning of the saying,
        `The sower is one person, and the reaper is another.'
004:038 I sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your
        own labours.  Others have laboured, and you are getting
        benefit from their labours."
004:039 Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many believed
        in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared,
        "He has told me all that I have ever done."
004:040 When however the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him on
        all sides to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.
004:041 Then a far larger number of people believed because of
        His own words,
004:042 and they said to the woman, "We no longer believe in Him simply
        because of your statements; for we have now heard for ourselves,
        and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world."
004:043 After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee;
004:044 though Jesus Himself declared that a Prophet has no honour
        in his own country.
004:045 When however He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed
        Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had
        done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been
        to the Festival.
004:046 So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made
        the water into wine.  Now there was a certain officer
        of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum.
004:047 Having heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee,
        he came to Him and begged Him to go down and cure his son;
        for he was at the point of death.
004:048 "Unless you and others see miracles and marvels," said Jesus,
        "nothing will induce you to believe."
004:049 "Sir," pleaded the officer, "come down before my child dies."
004:050 "You may return home," replied Jesus; "your son has recovered."
        He believed the words of Jesus, and started back home;
004:051 and he was already on his way down when his servants met him
        and told him that his son was alive and well.
004:052 So he inquired of them at what hour he had shown improvement.
        "Yesterday, about seven o'clock," they replied,
        "the fever left him."
004:053 Then the father recollected that that was the time at
        which Jesus had said to him, "Your son has recovered,"
        and he and his whole household became believers.
004:054 This is the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming
        from Judaea into Galilee.
005:001 After this there was a Festival of the Jews, and Jesus went
        up to Jerusalem.
005:002 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool,
        called in Hebrew `Bethesda.' It has five arcades.
005:003 In these there used to lie a great number of sick persons,
        and of people who were blind or lame or paralyzed.
005:004 []
005:005 And there was one man there who had been an invalid
        for thirty-eight years.
005:006 Jesus saw him lying there, and knowing that he had been a long
        time in that condition, He asked him, "Do you wish to have
        health and strength?"
005:007 "Sir," replied the sufferer, "I have no one to put me into
        the pool when the water is moved; but while I am coming
        some one else steps down before me."
005:008 "Rise," said Jesus, "take up your mat and walk."
005:009 Instantly the man was restored to perfect health, and he took
        up his mat and began to walk.
005:010 That day was a Sabbath.  Frequently the presiding officer is
        called the President, and sometimes there is a large number of
Vice Presidents appointed for mere complimentary purposes. The
        Vice Presidents
in large formal meetings, sit on the platform beside the President,
        and in his
absence, or when he vacates the chair, the first on the list
        that is present should take the chair.
        
47. Meeting of a Convention or Assembly of Delegates. If the members
        of the assembly have been elected or appointed as
        members, it becomes necessary to
know who are properly members of the assembly and entitled to vote, before
        the permanent
organization is effected. In this case a temporary organization
        is made, as already described, by the election
of a chairman
        === Page 107
===========================================================
        and secretary "pro tem.," when the chairman announces,
        "The next business in order is the appointment of a committee
        on credentials." A motion may then be made
covering the entire case, thus: "I move that a committee of three on the
        credentials of members be appointed by the Chair, and
        that the committee report as soon as practicable;" or they
        may include only
one of these details, thus: "I move that a committee be appointed on the
        credentials of members." In either case the Chair proceeds as
        already described in the cases
of committees on resolutions [§ 46, (c)].
        
On the motion to accept the report of the committee, none can vote except
        those reported by the
committee as having proper credentials.
        The committee, beside reporting a list of members with proper
        credentials, may report doubtful
or contested cases, with recommendations, which the assembly may
        adopt, or reject, or postpone, etc. Only members whose right to
        their seats is undisputed, can vote.
        
The chairman, after the question of credentials is disposed of,
        at least for the time, announces that "The next business
        in order is the election of permanent officers of
the assembly." Some one then moves the appointment of a
        === Page 108
===========================================================
        committee to nominate the
officers, in a form similar to this: "I move that a committee of
        three be appointed by the Chair to nominate the permanent
officers of this convention." This motion is treated as already
        explained. When the committee make their report, some one
        moves "That
the report of the committee be accepted and that the officers nominated
        be declared the officers of this convention."* [Where there
        is any competition for the offices, it is better
that they be elected by ballot. In this case, when the
        nominating committee
report, a motion can be made as follows: "I move that the convention
        now proceed to ballot for its permanent officers;" or "I
move that we now proceed to the election, by ballot, of the permanent
        officers of
this convention." [See Rules of Order, § 38, for balloting, and other
        methods of voting.] The constitutions of permanent
societies usually provide that the officers shall be elected by
        ballot.] This motion being carried, the
chairman declares the officers elected, and instantly calls the new
        presiding officer to the chair, and the temporary
        secretary is at the same time replaced. The convention
        is now organized for work.

48. A Permanent Society. (a) First Meeting. When it is desired to
form a permanent society, those interested in it should see that
only the proper persons are invited to be present, at a certain
time and place. It is not usual in mass meetings, or meetings called
to organize a society, to commence until
=== Page 109 ===========================================================

fifteen or thirty minutes after the appointed time, when some one
steps forward and says, "The meeting will please come to order; I
move that Mr. A. act as chairman of this meeting;" some one "seconds
the motion," when the one who made the motion puts it to vote (or,
as it is called, "puts the question"), as already described, under
an "occasional meeting" [§ 46, (a)]; and, as in that case, when the
chairman is elected, he announces as the first business in order
the election of a secretary.None of you have ever either heard His voice or seen what
        He is like.
005:038 Nor have you His word dwelling within you, for you refuse
        to believe Him whom *He* has sent.
005:039 "You search the Scriptures, because you suppose that in them
        you will find the Life of the Ages; and it is those Scriptures
        that yield testimony concerning me;
005:040 and yet you are unwilling to come to me that you may have Life.
005:041 "I do not accept glory from man,
005:042 but I know you well, and I know that in your hearts you do
        not really love God.
005:043 I have come as my Father's representative, and you do not
        receive me.  If some one else comes representing only himself,
        him you will receive.
005:044 How is it possible for you to believe, while you receive glory
        from one another and have no desire for the glory that comes
        from the only God?
005:045 "Do not suppose that I will accuse you to the Father.
        There is one who accuses you, namely Moses, on whom
        your hope rests.
005:046 For if you believe Moses, you would believe me;
        for he wrote about me.
005:047 But if you disbelieve his writings, how are you to believe my words?"
006:001 After this Jesus went away across the Lake of Galilee (that is,
        the Lake of Tiberias).
006:002 A vast multitude followed Him, because they witnessed the miracles
        on the sick which He was constantly performing.
006:003 Then Jesus went up the hill, and sat there with His disciples.
006:004 The Jewish Festival, the Passover, was at hand.
006:005 And when He looked round and saw an immense crowd coming
        towards Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread
        for all these people to eat?"
006:006 He said this to put Philip to the test, for He Himself knew
        what He was going to do.
006:007 "Seven pounds' worth of bread," replied Philip, "is not enough
        for them all to get even a scanty meal."
006:008 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
        said to Him,
006:009 "There is a boy here with five barley loaves and a couple of fish:
        but what is that among so many?"
006:010 "Make the people sit down," said Jesus.  The ground was
        covered with thick grass; so they sat down, the adult men
        numbering about 5,000.
006:011 Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He
        distributed them to those who were resting on the ground;
        and also the fish in like manner--as much as they desired.
006:012 When all were fully satisfied, He said to His disciples,
        "Gather up the broken portions that remain over, so that
        nothing be lost."
006:013 Accordingly they gathered them up; and with the fragments
        of the five barley loaves--the broken portions that remained
        over after they had done eating--they filled twelve baskets.
006:014 Thereupon the people, having seen the miracle He had performed,
        said, "This is indeed the Prophet who was to come into the world."
006:015 Perceiving, however, that they were about to come and carry
        Him off by force to make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again up
        the hill alone by Himself.
006:016 When evening came on, His disciples went down to the Lake.
006:017 There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross
        the Lake to Capernaum.  By this time it had become dark,
        and Jesus had not yet joined them.
006:018 The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.
006:019 When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw
        Jesus walking on the water and coming near the boat.
006:020 They were terrified; but He called to them.  "It is I," He said,
        "do not be afraid."
006:021 Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment
        the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going.
006:022 Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on
        the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one
        small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go
        on board with His disciples, but that His disciples went
        away without Him.
006:023 Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood
        of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord
        had given thanks.
006:024 When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples
        were there, they themselves also took boats and came to Capernaum
        to look for Jesus.
006:025 So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him,
        they asked Him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
006:026 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that you
        are searching for me not because you have seen miracles,
        but because you ate the loaves and had a hearty meal.
006:027 Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes,
        but on the food that remains unto the Life of the Ages--
        that food which will be the Son of Man's gift to you;
        for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal."
006:028 "What are we to do," they asked, "in order to carry out the things
        that God requires?"
006:029 "This," replied Jesus, "is above all the thing that God requires--
        that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent."
006:030 "What miracle then," they asked, "do you perform for us to see
        and become believers in you?  What do you *do*?
006:031 Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written,
        `He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat'."
006:032 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that Moses
        did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but my Father
        is giving you the bread--the true bread--out of Heaven.
006:033 For God's bread is that which comes down out of Heaven and gives
        Life to the world."
006:034 "Sir," they said, "always give us that bread."
006:035 "I am the bread of Life," replied Jesus; "he who comes to me shall
        never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never, never thirst.
006:036 But it is as I have said to you:  you have seen me and yet
        you do not believe.
006:037 Every one whom the Father gives me will come to me, and him
        who comes to me I will never on any account drive away.
006:038 For I have left Heaven and have come down to earth not to seek
        my own pleasure, but to do the will of Him who sent me.
006:039 And this is the will of Him who sent me, that of all that He
        has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it
        to life on the last day.
006:040 For this is my Father's will, that every one who fixes his gaze
        on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life
        of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day."
006:041 Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His
        claiming to be the bread which came down out of Heaven.
006:042 They kept asking, "Is not this man Joseph's son?
        To Commit.
        To Amend.
To Postpone Indefinitely.

        The motion to Reconsider can be made when any
other question is before the assembly, but cannot be acted upon until
        the business then before the assembly is disposed of
        [see note 5 above], when, if
called up, it takes precedence of all other motions except to
adjourn and to fix the time to which to adjourn. Questions incidental
to those before the assembly, take precedence of them and must be
acted upon first.

Two-thirds Vote.Objection to the Consideration
of a Question. An objection can be made to any principal motion
        [§ 6], but only when
it is first introduced, before
it has been debated. It is similar to a question of order [§ 14,] in
that it can be made while another member has the floor, and does
        not require a second;
and as the Chairman can call a member to order, so can he put this
question if he deems it necessary, upon his own responsibility. It
can not be debated [§ 35] or have any subsidiary motion [§ 7] applied
to it.If a man eats this bread, he shall live for ever.
        Moreover the bread which I will give is my flesh given
        for the life of the world."
006:052 This led to an angry debate among the Jews.  "How can this man,"
        they argued, "give us his flesh to eat?"
006:053 "In most solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus, "that unless
        you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood,
        you have no Life in you.
006:054 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life of the Ages,
        and I will raise him up on the last day.
006:055 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
006:056 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me,
        and I remain in union with him.
006:057 As the ever-living Father has sent me, and I live because of
        the Father, so also he who eats me will live because of me.
006:058 This is the bread which came down out of Heaven; it is unlike
        that which your forefathers ate--for they ate and yet died.

While in extreme cases there is no difficulty in deciding the question
        as to whether the practice of Congress determines the common
parliamentary law, yet between these extremes there must necessarily
        be a large number of doubtful
cases upon which there would be great difference of opinion, and to avoid
        the serious difficulties always arising from a lack
of definiteness in the law, every deliberative assembly should
        imitate our legislative bodies in adopting Rules of Order for
        the conduct
of their business.* [Where the practice of Congress differs from
that of Parliament upon a material point, the common law of this
country follows the practice of Congress.For Jesus
        knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe,
        and who it was that would betray Him.
006:065 So He added, "That is why I told you that no one can come
        to me unless it be granted him by the Father."
006:066 Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away,
        and no longer associated with Him.
006:067 Jesus therefore appealed to the Twelve.  "Will you go also?"
        He asked.
006:068 "Master," replied Simon Peter, "to whom shall we go?
        Your teachings tell us of the Life of the Ages.
006:069 And we have come to believe and know that *you* are indeed
        the Holy One of God."
006:070 "Did not I choose you--the Twelve?" said Jesus, "and even of you
        one is a devil."
006:071 He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot.
        For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterwards
        to betray Him.
007:001 After this Jesus moved from place to place in Galilee.
        He would not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking
        an opportunity to kill Him.
007:002 But the Jewish Festival of the Tent-Pitching was approaching.
007:003 So His brothers said to Him, "Leave these parts and go into Judaea,
        that not only we but your disciples also may witness the miracles
        which you perform.
007:004 For no one acts in secret, desiring all the while to be
        himself known publicly.  Any society adopting this Manual,
        should make its rules govern them
in all cases to which they are applicable, and in which
they are not inconsistent with the By-Laws and Rules of Order of the

rules should include all of the cases where it is desirable to vary from
        the rules in the Manual, and especially should provide for a
Quorum [§ 43], and an Order of Business [§ 44], as suggested in

The Manual is divided into two distinct parts, each complete in
itself.I do not now go up
        to this Festival, because my time is not yet fully come."
007:009 Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee.
007:010 When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival,
        then He also went up, not openly, but as it were privately.
