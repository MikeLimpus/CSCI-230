Book 46 1 Corinthians
001:001 Paul, called to be an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will
        of God--and our brother Sosthenes:
001:002 To the Church of God in Corinth, men and women consecrated
        in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all in every
        place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--
        their Lord as well as ours.
001:003 May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father
        and the Lord Jesus Christ.
001:004 I thank my God continually on your behalf for the grace of God
        bestowed on you in Christ Jesus--
001:005 that you have been so richly blessed in Him, with readiness
        of speech and fulness of knowledge.
001:006 Thus my testimony as to the Christ has been confirmed
        in your experience,
001:007 so that there is no gift of God in which you consciously come
        short while patiently waiting for the reappearing of our
        Lord Jesus Christ,
001:008 who will also keep you stedfast to the very End, so that you
        will be free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
001:009 God is ever true to His promises, and it was by Him that
        you were, one and all, called into fellowship with his
        Son Jesus Christ, our Lord.
001:010 Now I entreat you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        to cultivate a spirit of harmony--all of you--and that there
        be no divisions among you, but rather a perfect union through
        your having one mind and one judgement.
001:011 For I have been distinctly informed, my brethren, about you
        by Chloe's people, that there are dissensions among you.
001:012 What I mean is that each of you is a partisan.
        One man says "I belong to Paul;" another "I belong to Apollos;"
        a third "I belong to Peter;" a fourth "I belong to Christ."
001:013 Is the Christ in fragments?  Is it Paul who was crucified on
        your behalf?  LESSONS ON THE PARABLES OF THE SAVIOUR, for Sunday Schools and

QUESTIONS ADAPTED TO THE TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. By C. SOULE
CARTEE. 18mo. Parts I. and II. Fourth Thousand.001:014 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except
        Crispus and Gaius--
001:015 for fear people should say that you were baptized to
        be my adherents.
001:016 I did, however, baptize Stephanas' household also:
        but I do not think that I baptized any one else.
001:017 Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the Good News;
        and not in merely wise words--lest the Cross of Christ should
        be deprived of its power.
001:018 For the Message of the Cross is foolishness to those who are on
        the way to perdition, but it is the power of God to those whom
        He is saving.
001:019 For so it stands written, "I will exhibit the nothingness of
        the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent
        I will bring to nought."
001:020 Where is your wise man?  Price, 75 cents.
        
        "It is simple and unpretending: and though some of the pieces are
probably familiar to most readers, they all breathe a pure and
elevated spirit, and here and there is an exquisite effusion of
genius, which answers to the holiest wants of the soul.001:021 For after the world by its wisdom--as God in His wisdom had ordained--
        had failed to gain the knowledge of God, God was pleased,
        by the apparent foolishness of the Message which we preach,
        to save those who accepted it.
001:022 Seeing that Jews demand miracles, and Greeks go in search of wisdom,
001:023 while we proclaim a Christ who has been crucified--to the Jews
        a stumbling-block, to Gentiles foolishness,
001:024 but to those who have received the Call, whether Jews
        or Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
001:025 Because that which the world deems foolish in God is wiser
        than men's wisdom, and that which it deems feeble in God
        is mightier than men's might.
001:026 For consider, brethren, God's call to you.  Not many who are wise
        with merely human wisdom, not many of position and influence,
        not many of noble birth have been called.
001:027 But God has chosen the things which the world regards as foolish,
        in order to put its wise men to shame; and God has chosen
        the things which the world regards as destitute of influence,
        in order to put its powerful things to shame;
001:028 and the things which the world regards as base, and those which
        it sets utterly at nought--things that have no existence--
        God has chosen in order to reduce to nothing things that do exist;
001:029 to prevent any mortal man from boasting in the presence of God.
001:030 But you--and it is all God's doing--are in Christ Jesus:  He has
        become for us a wisdom which is from God, consisting of
        righteousness and sanctification and deliverance;
001:031 in order that it may be as Scripture says, "He who boasts--
        let his boast be in the Lord."
002:001 And as for myself, brethren, when I came to you, it was
        not with surpassing power of eloquence or earthly wisdom
        that I came, announcing to you that which God had commanded
        me to bear witness to.
002:002 For I determined to be utterly ignorant, when among you,
        of everything except of Jesus Christ, and of Him as
        having been crucified.
002:003 And so far as I myself was concerned, I came to you in conscious
        feebleness and in fear and in deep anxiety.
002:004 And my language and the Message that I proclaimed were not
        adorned with persuasive words of earthly wisdom, but depended
        upon truths which the Spirit taught and mightily carried home;
002:005 so that your trust might rest not on the wisdom of man but on
        the power of God.
002:006 Yet when we are among mature believers we do speak words of wisdom;
        a wisdom not belonging, however, to the present age nor
        to the leaders of the present age who are soon to pass away.
002:007 But in dealing with truths hitherto kept secret we speak of
        God's wisdom--that hidden wisdom which, before the world began,
        God pre-destined, so that it should result in glory to us;
002:008 a wisdom which not one of the leaders of the present age possesses,
        for if they had possessed it, they would never have crucified
        the Lord of glory.
002:009 But--to use the words of Scripture--we speak of things which
        eye has not seen nor ear heard, and which have never entered
        the heart of man:  all that God has in readiness for them
        that love Him.
002:010 For us, however, God has drawn aside the veil through the
        teaching of the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything,
        including the depths of the divine nature.

        "The charm of the book lies in the elevated
tone of thought and moral sentiment which pervades it. You feel, on closing
        the volume, as if leaving some ancient cathedral, where
        your soul had been mingling with
ascending anthems and prayers. There is scarcely a page which does
        not contain some fine strain of thought or sentiment,
        over which you shut the
book that you may pause and meditate.
        
"We recommend the volume to our readers, with the assurance
        that they will find few works in the current literature of the day
so well worth perusal."--_Christian Register._
"This is really an original book.But *we* have the mind of Christ.
003:001 And as for myself, brethren, I found it impossible to speak
        to you as spiritual men.  It had to be as to worldlings--
        mere babes in Christ.
003:002 I fed you with milk and not with solid food, since for this
        you were not yet strong enough.  And even now you are
        not strong enough:
003:003 you are still unspiritual.  For so long as jealousy and strife
        continue among you, can it be denied that you are unspiritual
        and are living and acting like mere men of the world?
003:004 For when some one says, "I belong to Paul," and another says,
        "I belong to Apollos," is not this the way men of the world speak?
003:005 What then is Apollos?  And what is Paul?  They are just
        God's servants, through whose efforts, and as the Lord granted
        power to each, you accepted the faith.
003:006 I planted and Apollos watered; but it was God who was,
        all the time, giving the increase.
003:007 So that neither the planter nor the waterer is of any importance.
        God who gives the increase is all in all.
003:008 Now in aim and purpose the planter and the waterer are one;
        and yet each will receive his own special reward, answering to
        his own special work.
003:009 Apollos and I are simply fellow workers for and with God,
        and you are *God's* field--God's* building.
003:010 In discharge of the task which God graciously entrusted to me, I--
        like a competent master-builder--have laid a foundation,
        and others are building upon it.  But let every one be careful
        how and what he builds.
003:011 For no one can lay any other foundation in addition to that
        which is already laid, namely Jesus Christ.
003:012 And whether the building which any one is erecting on that
        foundation be of gold or silver or costly stones, of timber
        or hay or straw--
003:013 the true character of each individual's work will become manifest.
        For the day of Christ will disclose it, because that day is
        soon to come upon us clothed in fire, and as for the quality
        of every one's work--the fire is the thing which will test it.
003:014 If any one's work--the building which he has erected--
        stands the test, he will be rewarded.
003:015 If any one's work is burnt up, he will suffer the loss of it;
        yet he will himself be rescued, but only, as it were,
        by passing through the fire.
003:016 Do you not know that you are God's Sanctuary, and that the Spirit
        of God has His home within you?
003:017 If any one is marring the Sanctuary of God, him will God mar;
        for the Sanctuary of God is holy, which you all are.
003:018 Let no one deceive himself.  If any man imagines that he is wise,
        compared with the rest of you, with the wisdom of the present age,
        let him become "foolish" so that he may be wise.
003:019 This world's wisdom is "foolishness" in God's sight; for it
        is written, "He snares the wise with their own cunning."
003:020 And again, "The Lord takes knowledge of the reasonings of the wise--
        how useless they are."
003:021 Therefore let no one boast about his human teachers.
003:022 For everything belongs to you--be it Paul or Apollos or Peter,
        the world or life or death, things present or future--
        everything belongs to you;
003:023 and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
004:001 As for us Apostles, let any one take this view of us--
        we are Christ's officers, and stewards of God's secret truths.
004:002 This being so, it follows that fidelity is what is
        required in stewards.
004:003 I however am very little concerned at undergoing your scrutiny,
        or that of other men; in fact I do not even scrutinize myself.
004:004 Though I am not conscious of having been in any way unfaithful,
        yet I do not for that reason stand acquitted; but He whose
        scrutiny I must undergo is the Lord.
004:005 Therefore form no premature judgements, but wait until
        the Lord returns.  He will both bring to light the secrets
        of darkness and will openly disclose the motives that have
        been in people's hearts; and then the praise which each man
        deserves will come to him from God.
004:006 In writing this much, brethren, with special reference to
        Apollos and myself, I have done so for your sakes, in order
        to teach you by our example what those words mean, which say,
        "Nothing beyond what is written!"--so that you may cease to take
        sides in boastful rivalry, for one teacher against another.
004:007 Why, who gives you your superiority, my brother?
        Or what have you that you did not receive?  And if you really
        did receive it, why boast as if this were not so?
004:008 Every one of you already has all that heart can desire;
        already you have grown rich; without waiting for us, you have
        ascended your thrones!  Yes indeed, would to God that you
        had ascended your thrones, that we also might reign with you!
004:009 God, it seems to me, has exhibited us Apostles last of all,
        as men condemned to death; for we have come to be a spectacle
        to all creation--alike to angels and to men.
004:010 We, for Christ's sake, are labeled as "foolish"; you, as Christians,
        are men of shrewd intelligence.  We are mere weaklings:
        you are strong.  You are in high repute:  we are outcasts.
004:011 To this very moment we endure both hunger and thirst,
        with scanty clothing and many a blow.
004:012 Homes we have none.  Wearily we toil, working with our own hands.
        When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we bear it patiently;
004:013 when slandered, we try to conciliate.  We have come
        to be regarded as the mere dirt and filth of the world--
        the refuse of the universe, even to this hour.
004:014 I am not writing all this to shame you, but I am offering you
        advice as my dearly-loved children.
004:015 For even if you were to have ten thousand spiritual instructors--
        for all that you could not have several fathers.
        It is I who in Christ Jesus became your father through
        the Good News.
004:016 I entreat you therefore to become like me.
004:017 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you.
        Spiritually he is my dearly-loved and faithful child.
        He will remind you of my habits as a Christian teacher--
        the manner in which I teach everywhere in every Church.
004:018 But some of you have been puffed up through getting the idea
        that I am not coming to Corinth.
004:019 But, if the Lord is willing, I shall come to you without delay;
        and then I shall know not the fine speeches of these
        conceited people, but their power.
004:020 For Apostolic authority is not a thing of words, but of power.
004:021 Which shall it be?  Shall I come to you with a rod, or in a
        loving and tender spirit?
005:001 It is actually reported that there is fornication among you,
        and of a kind unheard of even among the Gentiles--a man has
        his father's wife!
005:002 And you, instead of mourning and removing from among you the man
        who has done this deed of shame, are filled with self-complacency!
005:003 I for my part, present with you in spirit although absent
        in body, have already, as though I were present, judged him
        who has so acted.
005:004 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are all assembled and my
        spirit is with you, together with the power of our Lord Jesus,
005:005 I have handed over such a man to Satan for the destruction
        of his body, that his spirit may be saved on the day of
        the Lord Jesus.
005:006 It is no good thing--this which you make the ground of your boasting.
        Do you not know that a little yeast corrupts the whole
        of the dough?
005:007 Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be dough of a new kind;
        for in fact you *are* free from corruption.  For our Passover Lamb
        has already been offered in sacrifice--even Christ.
005:008 Therefore let us keep our festival not with old yeast nor with
        the yeast of what is evil and mischievous, but with bread free
        from yeast--the bread of transparent sincerity and of truth.
005:009 I wrote to you in that letter that you were not to
        associate with fornicators;
005:010 not that in this world you are to keep wholly aloof from
        such as they, any more than from people who are avaricious
        and greedy of gain, or from worshippers of idols.
        For that would mean that you would be compelled to go out
        of the world altogether.
005:011 But what I meant was that you were not to associate with
        any one bearing the name of "brother," if he was addicted
        to fornication or avarice or idol-worship or abusive language
        or hard-drinking or greed of gain.  With such a man you ought
        not even to eat.
005:012 For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders?
        Is it not for you to judge those who are within the Church
005:013 while you leave to God's judgement those who are outside?
        Remove the wicked man from among you.
006:001 If one of you has a grievance against an opponent, does he dare
        to go to law before irreligious men and not before God's people?
006:002 Do you not know that God's people will sit in judgement upon
        the world?  And if you are the court before which the world is
        to be judged, are you unfit to deal with these petty matters?
006:003 Do you not know that we are to sit in judgement upon angels--
        to say nothing of things belonging to this life?
006:004 If therefore you have things belonging to this life which need
        to be decided, is it men who are absolutely nothing in the Church--
        is it *they* whom you make your judges?
006:005 I say this to put you to shame.  Has it come to this,
        that there does not exist among you a single wise man competent
        to decide between a man and his brother,
006:006 but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
006:007 To say no more, then, it is altogether a defect in you that you
        have law-suits with one another.  Why not rather endure injustice?
        Why not rather submit to being defrauded?
006:008 On the contrary you yourselves inflict injustice and fraud,
        and upon brethren too.
006:009 Do you not know that unrighteous men will not inherit
        God's Kingdom?  Cherish no delusion here.  Neither fornicators,
        nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor any who are guilty
        of unnatural crime,
006:010 nor theives, nor avaricious people, nor any who are addicted
        to hard drinking, to abusive language or to greed of gain,
        will inherit God's Kingdom.
006:011 And all this describes what some of you were.  But now you have had
        every stain washed off:  now you have been set apart as holy:
        now you have been pronounced free from guilt; in the name
        of our Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God.
006:012 Everything is allowable to me, but not everything is profitable.
        Everything is allowable to me, but to nothing will I
        become a slave.
006:013 Food of all kinds is meant for the stomach, and the stomach
        is meant for food, and God will cause both of them to perish.
        Yet the body does not exist for the purpose of fornication,
        but for the Master's service, and the Master exists for the body;
006:014 and as God by His power raised the Master to life, so He
        will also raise us up.
006:015 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I
        then take away the members of Christ and make them the members
        of a prostitute?  No, indeed.
006:016 Or do you not know that a man who has to do with a prostitute is
        one with her in body?  For God says, "The two shall become one."
006:017 But he who is in union with the Master is one with Him in spirit.
006:018 Flee from fornication.  Any other sin that a human being commits
        lies outside the body; but he who commits fornication sins
        against his own body.
006:019 Or do you not know that your bodies are a sanctuary
        of the Holy Spirit who is within you--the Spirit whom you
        have from God?
006:020 And you are not your own, for you have been redeemed at
        infinite cost.  Therefore glorify God in your bodies.
007:001 I now deal with the subjects mentioned in your letter.
        It is well for a man to abstain altogether from marriage.
007:002 But because there is so much fornication every man should have
        a wife of his own, and every woman should have a husband.
007:003 Let a man pay his wife her due, and let a woman also pay
        her husband his.
007:004 A married woman is not mistress of her own person:
        her husband has certain rights.  In the same way a married man
        is not master of his own person:  his wife has certain rights.
007:005 Do not refuse one another, unless perhaps it is just for a time
        and by mutual consent, so that you may devote yourselves
        to prayer and may then associate again; lest the Adversary
        begin to tempt you because of your deficiency in self-control.
007:006 Thus much in the way of concession, not of command.
007:007 Yet I would that everybody lived as I do; but each of us
        has his own special gift from God--one in one direction
        and one in another.
007:008 But I tell the unmarried, and women who are widows, that it
        is well for them to remain as I am.
007:009 If, however, they cannot maintain self-control, by all means let
        them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion.
007:010 But to those already married my instructions are--yet not mine,
        but the Lord's--that a wife is not to leave her husband;
007:011 or if she has already left him, let her either remain as she
        is or be reconciled to him; and that a husband is not to send
        away his wife.
007:012 To the rest it is I who speak--not the Lord.  If a brother has
        a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him,
        let him not send her away.
007:013 And a woman who has an unbelieving husband--if he consents
        to live with her, let her not separate from him.
007:014 For, in such cases, the unbelieving husband has become--and is--
        holy through union with a Christian woman, and the unbelieving
        wife is holy through union with a Christian brother.
        Otherwise your children would be unholy, but in reality they
        have a place among God's people.
007:015 If, however, the unbeliever is determined to leave, let him
        or her do so.  Under such circumstances the Christian man
        or woman is no slave; God has called us to live lives of peace.
007:016 For what assurance have you, O woman, as to whether you
        will save your husband?  Or what assurance have you, O man,
        as to whether you will save your wife?
007:017 Only, whatever be the condition in life which the Lord has
        assigned to each individual--and whatever the condition in which
        he was living when God called him--in that let him continue.
007:018 This is what I command in all the Churches.  Was any one
        already circumcised when called?  Let him not have recourse
        to the surgeons.  Was any one uncircumcised when called?
        Let him remain uncircumcised.
007:019 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing:
        obedience to God's commandments is everything.
007:020 Whatever be the condition in life in which a man was,
        when he was called, in that let him continue.
007:021 Were you a slave when God called you?  Let not that weigh
        on your mind.  And yet if you can get your freedom,
        take advantage of the opportunity.
007:022 For a Christian, if he was a slave when called, is the Lord's
        freed man, and in the same way a free man, if called,
        becomes the slave of Christ.
007:023 You have all been redeemed at infinite cost:  do not become
        slaves to men.
007:024 Where each one stood when he was called, there, brethren, let him
        still stand--close to God.
007:025 Concerning unmarried women I have no command to give you from
        the Lord; but I offer you my opinion, which is that of a man who,
        through the Lord's mercy, is deserving of your confidence.
007:026 I think then that, taking into consideration the distress
        which is now upon us, it is well for a man to remain as he is.
007:027 Are you bound to a wife?  Do not seek to get free.
        Are you free from the marriage bond?  Do not seek for a wife.
007:028 Yet if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a maiden marries,
        she has not sinned.  Such people, however, will have
        outward trouble.  But I am for sparing you.
007:029 Yet of this I warn you, brethren:  the time has been shortened--
        so that henceforth those who have wives should be as though
        they had none,
007:030 those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice
        as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they
        did not possess,
007:031 and those who use the world as not using it to the full.
        For the world as it now exists is passing away.
007:032 And I would have you free from worldly anxiety.
        An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord's business--
        how he shall please the Lord;
007:033 but a married man concerns himself with the business of the world--
        how he shall please his wife.
007:034 There is a difference too between a married and an unmarried woman.
        She who is unmarried concerns herself with the Lord's business--
        that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married
        woman concerns herself with the business of the world--
        how she shall please her husband.
007:035 Thus much I say in your own interest; not to lay a trap for you,
        but to help towards what is becoming, and enable you to wait
        on the Lord without distraction.
007:036 If, however, a father thinks he is acting unbecomingly towards his
        still unmarried daughter if she be past the bloom of her youth,
        and so the matter is urgent, let him do what she desires;
        he commits no sin; she and her suitor should be allowed to marry.
007:037 But if a father stands firm in his resolve, being free from
        all external constraint and having a legal right to act
        as he pleases, and in his own mind has come to the decision
        to keep his daughter unmarried, he will do well.
007:038 So that he who gives his daughter in marriage does well,
        and yet he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
007:039 A woman is bound to her husband during the whole period
        that he lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty
        to marry whom she will, provided that he is a Christian.
007:040 But in my judgement, her state is a more enviable one if she
        remains as she is; and I also think that I have the Spirit of God.
008:001 Now as to things which have been sacrificed to idols.

        NOTICES OF THE PRESS.
        
"A more interesting and instructive biographical work we have never read.
        High as was our opinion of Channing,--of his intellectual
and moral worth,--the perusal of this work has convinced us that we never duly
        estimated him.... His letters reveal his character more fully
        than his sermons and essays. In his
letters he lays his heart entirely open; and no man, no matter what his
        opinions or prejudices, can read them without saying,--'Channing
        was, indeed, a great and good man,--one who lived for the
world!'"--_Christian Messenger._
        "Only one who was similar in purpose and temper,--who felt
        like aspirations, hopes, and faith,--could at all
do justice to the distinguished subject. The present book must, therefore,
        we are sure, give us Channing's
character in its completeness, and true harmony and proportions
        of parts."--_Salem Observer._
        "These memoirs of a great and good man will, we apprehend, obtain
        an uncommonly extensive circulation, not only among the
        denomination
of Christians in which he ranked himself, but with all who reverence
        purity of character, an enlarged
philanthropy, and eminent talents, guided by virtue and piety."--_Salem
        Register._
"If we mistake not, now is the very time in God's providence when the
        biography of William Ellery Channing could best make its
        appearance.
We have heard that a distinguished divine, of different speculative
religious views from Dr. Channing, has recently said,--'Channing
is greatly needed among us at this present moment.' Behold him here!
We doubt not that the biography thus prepared is to make a great
impression on the age that is passing, and that is yet to
come."--_Christian Register._

Price, $1.00.Can it be denied that I
        have seen Jesus, our Lord?  Are not you yourselves my work
        in the Lord?
009:002 If to other men I am not an Apostle, yet at any rate I am one to you;
        for your very existence as a Christian Church is the seal
        of my Apostleship.
009:003 That is how I vindicate myself to those who criticize me.
009:004 Have we not a right to claim food and drink?
009:005 Have we not a right to take with us on our journeys a Christian
        sister as our wife, as the rest of the Apostles do--
        and the Lord's brothers and Peter?
009:006 Or again, is it only Barnabas and myself who are not at liberty
        to give up working with our hands?
009:007 What soldier ever serves at his own cost?  Who plants
        a vineyard and yet does not eat any of the grapes?
        Or who tends a herd of cattle and yet does not taste their milk?
009:008 Am I making use of merely worldly illustrations?
        Does not the Law speak in the same tone?
009:009 For in the Law of Moses it is written, "Thou shalt not muzzle
        an ox while it is treading out the grain."
009:010 Is God simply thinking about the oxen?  Or is it really in our
        interest that He speaks?  Of course, it was written in our interest,
        because it is His will that when a plough-man ploughs,
        and a thresher threshes, it should be in the hope of sharing
        that which comes as the result.
