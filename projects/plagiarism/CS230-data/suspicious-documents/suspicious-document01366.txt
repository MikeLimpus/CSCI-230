"
003:005 So he looked and waited, expecting to receive something from them.
003:006 "I have no silver or gold," Peter said, "but what I have, I give you.
        In the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene--walk!"
003:007 Then taking his hand Peter lifted him up, and immediately
        his feet and ankles were strengthened.
003:008 Leaping up, he stood upright and began to walk, and went into
        the Temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.
003:009 All the people saw him walking and praising God;
003:010 and recognizing him as the man who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate
        of the Temple asking for alms, they were filled with awe
        and amazement at what had happened to him.
003:011 While he still clung to Peter and John, the people, awe-struck, ran up
        crowding round them in what was known as Solomon's Portico.
003:012 Peter, seeing this, spoke to the people.  "Israelites," he said,
        "why do you wonder at this man?  Or why gaze at us, as though
        by any power or piety of our own we had enabled him to walk?
003:013 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers,
        has conferred this honour on His Servant Jesus, whom you
        delivered up and disowned in the presence of Pilate,
        when he had decided to let Him go.
003:014 Yes, you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked
        as a favour the release of a murderer.
003:015 The Prince of Life you put to death; but God has raised Him
        from the dead, and we are witnesses as to that.
003:016 It is His name--faith in that name being the condition--
        which has strengthened this man whom you behold and know;
        and the faith which He has given has made this man sound
        and strong again, as you can all see.
003:017 "And now, brethren, I know that it was in ignorance that you
        did it, as was the case with your rulers also.
003:018 But in this way God has fulfilled the declarations He made
        through all the Prophets, that His Christ would suffer.
003:019 Repent, therefore, and reform your lives, so that the record
        of your sins may be cancelled, and that there may come seasons
        of revival from the Lord,
003:020 and that He may send the Christ appointed beforehand
        for you--even Jesus.
003:021 Heaven must receive Him until those times of which God has spoken
        from the earliest ages through the lips of His holy Prophets--
        the times of the reconstitution of all things.
003:022 Moses declared, "`The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet
        for you from among your brethren as He has raised me.
        In all that He says to you, you must listen to Him.
003:023 And every one, without exception, who refuses to listen to that
        Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the People.'
003:024 Yes, and all the Prophets, from Samuel onwards--all who have spoken--
        have also announced the coming of this present time.
003:025 "You are the heirs of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God
        made with your forefathers when He said to Abraham, `And through
        your posterity all the families of the world shall be blessed.'
003:026 It is to you first that God, after raising His Servant from
        the grave, has sent Him to bless you, by causing every one
        of you to turn from your wickedness."
004:001 While they were saying this to the people, the Priests,
        the Commander of the Temple Guard, and the Sadducees
        came upon them,
004:002 highly incensed at their teaching the people and proclaiming
        in the case of Jesus the Resurrection from among the dead.
004:003 They arrested the two Apostles and lodged them in custody till
        the next day; for it was already evening.
004:004 But many of those who had listened to their preaching believed;
        and the number of the adult men had now grown to be about 5,000.
004:005 The next day a meeting was held in Jerusalem of their
        Rulers, Elders, and Scribes,
004:006 with Annas the High Priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the
        other members of the high-priestly family.
004:007 So they made the Apostles stand in the centre, and demanded
        of them, "By what power or in what name have you done this?"
004:008 Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he replied,
        "Rulers and Elders of the people,
004:009 if we to-day are under examination concerning the benefit
        conferred on a man helplessly lame, as to how this man
        has been cured;
004:010 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel,
        that through the name of Jesus the Anointed, the Nazarene,
        whom *you* crucified, but whom *God* has raised from among
        the dead--through that name this man stands here before you
        in perfect health.
004:011 This Jesus is the Stone treated with contempt by you the builders,
        but it has been made the Cornerstone.
004:012 And in no other is the great salvation to be found; for, in fact,
        there is no second name under Heaven that has been given
        among men through which we are to be saved."
004:013 As they looked on Peter and John so fearlessly outspoken--
        and also discovered that they were illiterate persons,
        untrained in the schools--they were surprised; and now they
        recognized them as having been with Jesus.
004:014 And seeing the man standing with them--the man who had been cured--
        they had no reply to make.
004:015 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin while they
        conferred among themselves.
004:016 "What are we to do with these men?" they asked one another;
        for the fact that a remarkable miracle has been performed
        by them is well known to every one in Jerusalem, and we
        cannot deny it.
004:017 But to prevent the matter spreading any further among the people,
        let us stop them by threats from speaking in the future
        in this name to any one whatever."
004:018 So they recalled the Apostles, and ordered them altogether
        to give up speaking or teaching in the name of Jesus.
004:019 But Peter and John replied, "Judge whether it is right in God's
        sight to listen to you instead of listening to God.
004:020 As for us, what we have seen and heard we cannot
        help speaking about."
004:021 The Court added further threats and then let them go,
        being quite unable to find any way of punishing them on account
        of the people, because all gave God the glory for the thing
        that had happened.
004:022 For the man was over forty years of age on whom this miracle
        of restoration to health had been performed.
004:023 After their release the two Apostles went to their friends,
        and told them all that the High Priests and Elders had said.
004:024 And they, upon hearing the story, all lifted up their voices
        to God and said, "O Sovereign Lord, it is Thou who didst make
        Heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them,
004:025 and didst say through the Holy Spirit by the lips of our forefather
        David Thy servant, "`Why have the nations stamped and raged,
        and the peoples formed futile plans?
004:026 The kings of the earth came near, and the rulers assembled
        together against the Lord and against His Anointed.'"
004:027 "They did indeed assemble in this city in hostility to Thy holy
        Servant Jesus whom Thou hadst anointed--Herod and Pontius Pilate
        with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel--
004:028 to do all that Thy power and Thy will had predetermined
        should be done.
004:029 And now, Lord, listen to their threats, and enable Thy servants
        to proclaim Thy Message with fearless courage,
004:030 whilst Thou stretchest out Thine arm to cure men, and to give
        signs and marvels through the name of Thy holy Servant Jesus."
004:031 When they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook,
        and they were, one and all, filled with the Holy Spirit,
        and proceeded to tell God's Message with boldness.
004:032 Among all those who had embraced the faith there was but one heart
        and soul, so that none of them claimed any of his possessions
        as his own, but everything they had was common property;
004:033 while the Apostles with great force of conviction delivered
        their testimony as to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus;
        and great grace was upon them all.
004:034 And, in fact, there was not a needy man among them,
        for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them,
        and brought the money which they realised,
004:035 and gave it to the Apostles, and distribution was made to every
        one according to his wants.
004:036 In this way Joseph, whom the Apostles gave the name of Bar-nabas--
        signifying `Son of Encouragement'--a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
004:037 sold a farm which he had, and brought the money and gave it
        to the Apostles.
005:001 There was a man of the name of Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira,
        sold some property but,
005:002 with her full knowledge and consent, dishonestly kept back
        part of the price which he received for it, though he brought
        the rest and gave it to the Apostles.
005:003 "Ananias," said Peter, "why has Satan taken possession of your heart,
        that you should try to deceive the Holy Spirit and dishonestly
        keep back part of the price paid you for this land?
005:004 While it remained unsold, was not the land your own?
        And when sold, was it not at your own disposal?
        How is it that you have cherished this design in your heart?
        It is not to men you have told this lie, but to God."
005:005 Upon hearing these words Ananias fell down dead, and all who
        heard the words were awe-struck.
005:006 The younger men, however, rose, and wrapping the body up,
        carried it out and buried it.
005:007 About three hours had passed, when his wife came in,
        knowing nothing of what had happened.
005:008 Peter at once questioned her.  "Tell me," he said,
        "whether you sold the land for so much."  "Yes," she replied,
        "for so much."
005:009 "How was it," replied Peter, "that you two agreed to try
        an experiment upon the Spirit of the Lord?  The men who have
        buried your husband are already at the door, and they will
        carry you out."
005:010 Instantly she fell down dead at his feet, and the young men came
        in and found her dead.  So they carried her out and buried
        her by her husband's side.
005:011 This incident struck terror into the whole Church, and into
        the hearts of all who heard of it.
005:012 Many signs and marvels continued to be done among the people
        by the Apostles; and by common consent they all met
        in Solomon's Portico.
005:013 But none of the others dared to attach themselves to them.
        Yet the people held them in high honour--
005:014 and more and more believers in the Lord joined them,
        including great numbers both of men and women--
005:015 so that they would even bring out their sick friends into
        the streets and lay them on light couches or mats, in order
        that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall
        on one or other of them.
005:016 The inhabitants, too, of the towns in the neighbourhood
        of Jerusalem came in crowds, bringing sick persons and some
        who were harassed by foul spirits, and they were cured,
        one and all.
