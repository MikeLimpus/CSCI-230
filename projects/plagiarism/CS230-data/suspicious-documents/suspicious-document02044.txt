  And He touched the ear
        and healed it.
022:052 Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple
        and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, "Have you come out
        as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?
022:053 While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did
        not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour--
        and the power of darkness."
022:054 And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the
        High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.
022:055 And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court
        and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was
        sitting among them,
022:056 when a maidservant saw him sitting by the fire, and, looking fixedly
        at him, she said, "This man also was with him."
022:057 But he denied it, and declared, "Woman, I do not know him."
022:058 Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, "You, too, are one
        of them."  Allix, a distinguished engineer
of that service; and the propeller more recently introduced by M. Mangin, of
        the same corps, if it performs all that is claimed for
        it, namely, that it
does away with the "shake," will be of great value.No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.
022:061 The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected
        the Master's words, how He had said to him, "This very day,
        before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
022:062 And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.
022:063 Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat
        Him in cruel sport,
022:064 or blindfolded Him, and then challenged Him.  "Prove to us,"
        they said, "that you are a prophet, by telling us who it
        was that struck you."
022:065 And they said many other insulting things to Him.
022:066 As soon as it was day, the whole body of the Elders,
        both High Priests and Scribes, assembled.  The first result of
        their efforts, La Pomone, screw-frigate,
was shown to the world in 1844, and after careful inspection, (in
1853,) it is affirmed, such was the perfection of her general
organization, that she has hardly been excelled by any of her younger
sisters."If I tell you," He replied,
        "you will certainly not believe;
022:068 and if I ask you questions, you will certainly not answer.
022:069 But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated
        at the right hand of God's omnipotence."
022:070 Thereupon they cried out with one voice, "You, then, are the Son
        of God?"  "It is as you say," He answered; "I am He."
022:071 "What need have we of further evidence?" they said; "for we
        ourselves have heard it from his own lips."
023:001 Then the whole assembly rose and brought Him to Pilate,
        and began to accuse Him.
023:002 "We have found this man," they said, "an agitator among
        our nation, forbidding the payment of tribute to Caesar,
        and claiming to be himself an anointed king."
023:003 Then Pilate asked Him, "You, then, are the King of the Jews?"  "It is
        as you say," He replied.
023:004 Pilate said to the High Priests and to the crowd, "I can find
        no crime in this man."
023:005 But they violently insisted.  "He stirs up the people," they said,
        "throughout all Judaea with His teaching--even from Galilee
        (where He first started) to this city."
023:006 On hearing this, Pilate inquired, "Is this man a Galilaean?"
023:007 And learning that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he sent
        Him to Herod, for he too was in Jerusalem at that time.
023:008 To Herod the sight of Jesus was a great gratification, for, for a
        long time, he had been wanting to see Him, because he had
        heard so much about Him.  He hoped also to see some miracle
        performed by Him.
023:009 So he put a number of questions to Him, but Jesus gave
        him no reply.
