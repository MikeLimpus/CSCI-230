013:029 So also do you, when you see these things happening, be sure
        that He is near, at your very door.
013:030 I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will
        certainly not pass away without all these things having
        first taken place.
013:031 Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words
        will not pass away.
013:032 "But as to that day or the exact time no one knows--not even
        the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
013:033 Take care, be on the alert, and pray; for you do not know
        when it will happen.
013:034 It is like a man living abroad who has left his house, and given
        the management to his servants--to each one his special duty--
        and has ordered the porter to keep awake.
013:035 Be wakeful therefore, for you know not when the master of
        the house is coming--in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crow,
        or at dawn.
013:036 Beware lest He should arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep.
013:037 Moreover, what I say to you I say to all--Be wakeful!"
014:001 It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of
        Unleavened Bread, and the High Priests and Scribes were bent
        on finding how to seize Him by stratagem and put Him to death.
014:002 But they said, "Not on the Festival-day, for fear there should
        be a riot among the people."
014:003 Now when He was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
        while He was at table, there came a woman with a jar of pure,
        sweet-scented ointment very costly:  she broke the jar
        and poured the ointment over His head.
014:004 But there were some who said indignantly among themselves,
        "Why has the ointment been thus wasted?
014:005 For that ointment might have been sold for fifteen pounds
        or more, and the money have been given to the poor."
        And they were exceedingly angry with her.
014:006 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone:  why are you troubling her?
        She has done a most gracious act towards me.
014:007 For you always have the poor among you, and whenever you
        choose you can do acts of kindness to them; but me you
        have not always.
014:008 What she could she did:  she has perfumed my body in preparation
        for my burial.
014:009 And I solemnly tell you that wherever in the whole world
        the Good News shall be proclaimed, this which she has done
        shall also be told in remembrance of her."
014:010 But Judas Iscariot, already mentioned as one of the Twelve,
        went to the High Priests to betray Jesus to them.
014:011 They gladly listened to his proposal, and promised to give
        him a sum of money.  So he looked out for an opportunity
        to betray Him.
014:012 On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread--the day for
        killing the Passover lamb--His disciples asked Him, "Where shall
        we go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
014:013 So He sent two of His disciples with instructions, saying,
        "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher
        of water:  follow him,
014:014 and whatever house he enters, tell the master of the house,
        `The Rabbi asks, Where is my room where I can eat the Passover
        with my disciples?'
014:015 Then he will himself show you a large room upstairs, ready furnished:
        there make preparation for us."
014:016 So the disciples went out and came to the city, and found everything
        just as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.
014:017 When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.
014:018 And while they were at table Jesus said, "I solemnly tell you
        that one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."
014:019 They were filled with sorrow, and began asking Him, one by one,
        "Not I, is it?"
014:020 "It is one of the Twelve," He replied; "he who is dipping
        his fingers in the dish with me.
014:021 For the Son of Man is going His way as it is written about Him;
        but alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!
        "Who enters here finds joy," said the Oldest Fairy of All, and a
crown of happiness sat on her hair.
        
        "You come to
work?" she asked.
        
"I come to learn what I may do to help the suffering earth," said
        Fairy Tenderheart. "Its cries of agony have beaten on my
heart until there was no rest for me in Fairyland. Is there no way to
        make war cease? I come to you for wisdom."
The Oldest Fairy of All rose up and smiled, and her face was brighter
than the moon and stars. "Look closely at my flowers," she said,
        "and tell me which you think most beautiful."
        The flowers bloomed on every side, in every lovely
hue--crimson and gold and orange, blue and purple and pink and
        softest lavender.
All were scented, and all were beautiful; but there was one plant
that pleased the little fairy more than any other. It grew no taller than
        the rest, made no great show of colour, yet through
        its stems and
leaves there shone a radiance as if a light hid in them. Its flowers
        were clear as crystal--one could see quite through them--but
        the sunlight falling
on them was broken into glowing colours, so that every blossom was
a little bunch of flashing rainbows. And where the flowers had
closed and grown to fruit they hung golden as the sun and fragrant
with a scent that stole upon the wind and made the heart heat high
with happiness.
"This is the most beautiful," said Fairy Tenderheart.
"You have chosen well," said the Oldest Fairy of All. "You are
fitted to help me in my work.There He said
        to His disciples, "Sit down here till I have prayed."
014:033 Then He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began
        to be full of terror and distress,
014:034 and He said to them, "My heart is oppressed with anguish
        to the very point of death:  wait here and keep awake."
014:035 Going forward a short distance He threw Himself upon His face
        and prayed repeatedly that, if it was possible, He might be
        spared that time of agony;
014:036 and He said, "Abba! my Father! all things are possible for Thee:
        take this cup of suffering away from me:  and yet not what
        I desire, but what Thou desirest."
014:037 Then He came and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Simon,
        are you asleep?  Had you not strength to keep awake a single hour?
014:038 Be wakeful, all of you, and keep on praying, that you may
        not come into temptation:  the spirit is right willing,
        but the body is frail."
014:039 He again went away and prayed, using the very same words.
014:040 When He returned He again found them asleep, for they were
        very tired; and they knew not how to answer Him.
014:041 A third time He came, and then He said, "Sleep on and rest.
        Enough! the hour has come.  Even now they are betraying
        the Son of Man into the hands of sinful men.
014:042 Rouse yourselves, let us be going:  my betrayer is close at hand."
014:043 Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve,
        came and with him a crowd of men armed with swords and cudgels,
        sent by the High Priests and Scribes and Elders.
014:044 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them.
        "The one I kiss," he said, "is the man:  lay hold of him,
        and take him safely away."
014:045 So he came, and going straight to Jesus he said, "Rabbi!"
        and kissed Him with seeming affection;
014:046 whereupon they laid hands on Him and held Him firmly.
014:047 But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck a blow
        at the High Priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
014:048 "Have you come out," said Jesus, "with swords and cudgels
        to arrest me, as if you had to fight with a robber?
014:049 Day after day I used to be among you in the Temple teaching,
        and you never seized me.  But this is happening in order
        that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.'
014:050 Then His friends all forsook Him and fled.
014:051 One youth indeed did follow Him, wearing only a linen cloth
        round his bare body.  Of him they laid hold,
014:052 but he left the linen cloth in their hands and fled without it.
014:053 So they led Jesus away to the High Priest, and with him there
        assembled all the High Priests, Elders, and Scribes.
014:054 Peter followed Jesus at a distance, as far as the outer court
        of the High Priest's palace.  But there he remained sitting
        among the officers, and warming himself by the fire.
014:055 Meanwhile the High Priests and the entire Sanhedrin were
        endeavouring to get evidence against Jesus in order to put
        Him to death, but could find none;
014:056 for though many gave false testimony against Him, their statements
        did not tally.
014:057 Then some came forward as witnesses and falsely declared,
014:058 "We have heard him say, `I will pull down this Sanctuary
        built by human hands, and three days afterwards I will erect
        another built without hands.'"
014:059 But not even in this shape was their testimony consistent.
014:060 At last the High Priest stood up, and advancing into the midst
        of them all, asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make?
        What is the meaning of all this that these witnesses
        allege against you?"
014:061 But He remained silent, and gave no reply.  A second time
        the High Priest questioned Him.  "Are you the Christ,
        the Son of the Blessed One?" he said.
014:062 "I am," replied Jesus, "and you and others will see the Son
        of Man sitting at the right hand of the divine Power,
        and coming amid the clouds of the sky."
014:063 Rending his garments the High Priest exclaimed, "What need
        have we of witnesses after that?
014:064 You all heard his impious words.  What is your judgement?"
        Then with one voice they condemned Him as deserving of death.
014:065 Thereupon some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him,
        while striking Him with their fists and crying, "Prove that you
        are a prophet."  The officers too struck Him with open hands
        as they took Him in charge.
014:066 Now while Peter was below in the quadrangle, one of the
        High Priest's maidservants came,
014:067 and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said,
        "You also were with Jesus, the Nazarene."
014:068 But he denied it, and said, "I don't know--I don't understand--
        What do you mean?"  And then he went out into the outer court.
        Just then a cock crowed.
014:069 Again the maidservant saw him, and again began to say to
        the people standing by, "He is one of them."
014:070 A second time he repeatedly denied it.  Soon afterwards
        the bystanders again accused Peter, saying, "You are surely
        one of them, for you too are a Galilaean."
014:071 But he broke out into curses and oaths, declaring, "I know
        nothing of the man you are talking about."
014:072 No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed for the second time,
        and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, "Before the
        cock crows twice, you will three times disown me."
        "I too have wept in earlier days when men
have fought. But our tears are wasted, little sister. Come away."
        Fairy Tenderheart looked eagerly at her. "You who have watched
        the world so many years," she said, "tell me why such dreadful
deeds are done down there.""Are *you* the King of the Jews?"
        he asked.  "I am," replied Jesus.
015:003 Then, as the High Priests went on heaping accusations on Him,
015:004 Pilate again and again asked Him, "Do you make no reply?
        Listen to the many charges they are bringing against you."
015:005 But Jesus made no further answer:  so that Pilate wondered.
015:006 Now at the Festival it was customary for Pilate to release to
        the Jews any one prisoner whom they might beg off from punishment;
015:007 and at this time a man named Barabbas was in prison
        among the insurgents--persons who in the insurrection
        had committed murder.
015:008 So the people came crowding up, asking Pilate to grant them
        the usual favour.
015:009 "Shall I release for you the King of the Jews?" answered Pilate.
015:010 For he could see that it was out of sheer spite that the
        High Priests had handed Him over.
015:011 But the High Priests urged on the crowd to obtain Barabbas's
        release in preference;
015:012 and when Pilate again asked them, "What then shall I do to
        the man you call King of the Jews?"
015:013 they once more shouted out, "Crucify Him!"
015:014 "Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.
        But they vehemently shouted, "Crucify Him!"
On these events of the future we shall not now speculate; but if past history
        throws any light on the character of our population, one
thing may be confidently predicted. If Home Rule should be ultimately
        conceded to Ireland, the political party which may be
responsible for the carrying of the scheme, will have to look
        forward to a long period of exclusion
from public confidence. However the British people may be worried or
        deluded into
forgetfulness of their duty to themselves and to Ireland, the working
        of a Dublin Parliament will soon rouse them,
the reaction will set in; and the authors of the scheme will have before
        them as lengthened a banishment from power, as the country
gentlemen suffered when their chivalrous devotion to the House of
        Stuart blinded them for a time to the practical interests of
        England; as was the
fate of the Whigs at the beginning of this century, when they
        identified their party with implacable
opposition to Pitt's struggle to deliver Europe from the tyranny of
Bonaparte.

        among them, drawing lots to decide what each should take.
015:025 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified Him.
015:026 Over His head was the notice in writing of the charge
        against Him:  THE KING OF THE JEWS.
015:027 And together with Jesus they crucified two robbers, one at His
        right hand and one at His left.
015:028 []
015:029 And all the passers-by reviled Him.  They shook their heads
        at Him and said, "Ah! you who were for destroying the Sanctuary
        and building a new one in three days,
015:030 come down from the cross and save yourself."
015:031 In the same way the High Priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on
        scoffing at Him, saying to one another, "He has saved others:
        himself he cannot save!
015:032 This Christ, the King of Israel, let him come down now from
        the cross, that we may see and believe."  Even the men
        who were being crucified with Him heaped insults on Him.
015:033 At noon there came a darkness over the whole land, lasting till
        three o'clock in the afternoon.
015:034 But at three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
        "Elohi, Elohi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God,
        why hast Thou forsaken me?"
015:035 Some of the bystanders, hearing Him, said, "Listen, he is
        calling for Elijah!"
she asked.
        
        "You will see when you are dressed. Hurry, or you will miss her."

[Illustration: "The older fairies were dressing themselves and
combing their long fine hair."]
"Oh dear! I am so sleepy," said Poppypink, and she yawned again.let us see whether Elijah will come
        and take him down."
015:037 But Jesus uttered a loud cry and yielded up His spirit.
015:038 And the curtain in the Sanctuary was torn in two,
        from top to bottom.
015:039 And when the Centurion who stood in front of the cross saw that He
        was dead, he exclaimed, "This man was indeed God's Son."
015:040 There were also a party of women looking on from a distance;
        among them being both Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother
        of James the Little and of Joses, and Salome--
015:041 all of whom in the Galilaean days had habitually been with Him
        and cared for Him, as well as many other women who had come
        up to Jerusalem with Him.
015:042 Towards sunset, as it was the Preparation--that is, the day
        preceding the Sabbath--
015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea came, a highly respected member of the Council,
        who himself also was living in expectation of the Kingdom of God.
        He summoned up courage to go in to see Pilate and beg for
        the body of Jesus.
015:044 But Pilate could hardly believe that He was already dead.
        He called, however, for the Centurion and inquired whether
        He had been long dead;
015:045 and having ascertained the fact he granted the body to Joseph.
015:046 He, having bought a sheet of linen, took Him down, wrapped Him
        in the sheet and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock;
        after which he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.
015:047 Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were looking
        on to see where He was put.
016:001 When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother
        of James, and Salome, bought spices, in order to come and
        anoint His body.
016:002 So, very soon after sunrise on the first day of the week,
        they came to the tomb;
016:003 and they were saying to one another, `Who will roll away
        the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
016:004 But then, looking up, they saw that the stone was already
        rolled back:  for it was of immense size.
016:005 Upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting
        at their right hand, clothed in a long white robe.
        They were astonished and terrified.
016:006 But he said to them, "Do not be terrified.  Over the polished
        glass began to float the pictures of the country's life. "How can
I show my gratitude?" the Queen-mother asked; but the fairies were
gone.
Next morning when the little king awoke he ran to see the fine new
mirror in his room.He has come back to life:  He is not here:  this is the place
        where they laid Him.
016:007 But go and tell His disciples and Peter that He is going
        before you into Galilee:  and that there you will see Him,
        as He told you."
016:008 So they came out, and fled from the tomb, for they were greatly
        agitated and surprised; and they said not a word to any one,
        for they were afraid.
016:009 [But He rose to life early on the first day of the week,
        and appeared first to Mary of Magdala from whom He had
        expelled seven demons.
016:010 She went and brought the tidings to those who had been with Him,
        as they were mourning and weeping.
016:011 But they, when they were told that He was alive and that she
        had seen Him, could not believe it.
016:012 Afterwards He showed Himself in another form to two of them
        as they were walking, on their way into the country.
016:013 These, again, went and told the news to the rest; but not even
        them did they believe.
016:014 Later still He showed Himself to the Eleven themselves
        whilst they were at table, and He upbraided them with their
        unbelief and obstinacy in not having believed those who had
        seen Him alive.
016:015 Then He said to them, "Go the whole world over, and proclaim
        the Good News to all mankind.
016:016 He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who
        disbelieves will be condemned.
016:017 And signs shall attend those who believe, even such as these.
