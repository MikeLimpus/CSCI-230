INTRODUCTION


I.

_One Epistle To Mr. Pope_, complained Pope to Bethel, "contains as many
Lyes as Lines." But just for that reason it is not, as Pope also says in
the same letter, "below all notice."[1] _The Blatant Beast_, published
twelve years later, is another attack on Pope almost as compendious and
quite as virulent. They are here presented to the modern student of Pope
as good examples of their kind. The importance of the pamphlet attacks
on Pope for a full understanding of his satiric art is universally
admitted, but the pamphlets themselves were cheap and ephemeral,
and copies are now rare and not easily come by. Both in the
comprehensiveness of their charges and in the slashing hatred which
informs them (however feeble the verse), _One Epistle_ and _The Blatant
Beast_ offer as fair a sample as any two such pamphlets can of the
calumny, detraction, and critical misunderstanding Pope endured, for the
most part patiently, from the publication of his _Essay on Criticism_ to
the year of his death. "Welcome for thee, fair Virtue! all the past,"
(_Epistle to Arbuthnot_, l. 358) he exclaimed in his role as Satirist.

It was this public proclamation of Virtue that confused and enraged the
Dunces. We have again learned to read satire as something quite other
than an expression of personal malice and misanthropy. What the present
pamphlets amply testify to is that most of the Dunces were no more able
to read satire properly than were Pope's nineteenth-century critics.
They were, as Pope quite properly kept pointing out, very bad writers
and very dull men. The _ethos_ of the satiric _persona_ was something
they could not understand. Although some of the Dunces knew their
classics well and although all of them, we may presume, read the Roman
satirists, one did not, typically, in Grub Street consult one's Horace
with diurnal hand; one consulted the public. Literature to them was
sold. They were not deeply concerned about absolute standards of
right and wrong, about works of imagination which justify an entire
civilization, about the problem of tradition and the individual talent.
Accordingly, they explained satire, with the only vocabulary they had,
as the expression of ingratitude, purely personal malice, and demonic
pride, the product of a diseased heart and a misshapen body.

It would be misleading to suggest a narrow definition of Pope's Dunces.
Some were critics of worth, such as Dennis and Gildon; some were not
despicable minor poets, such as Welsted and Cooke. But if we leave these
aside, as well as his aristocratic enemies, Lady Mary and Lord Hervey,
some valid generalizations emerge. The very persistency of the Dunces'
attacks on Pope (I have located over one hundred and fifty published
during Pope's lifetime) and the large number of anonymous pamphlets that
we cannot definitely ascribe to anyone Pope ever mentioned suggest that
the Battle of the Dunces is best seen economically and sociologically.
They were, for the most part, hack-writers, who were attempting the
commercialization of literature that Pope recognized and deplored.
Since they were authors to be let, they were neither fastidious about
standards of taste nor filled with reverence for the Word. Yet Pope
had succeeded in doing what they could not do--he had made himself a
moderately rich man entirely by writing poetry. No theme recurs more
insistently and suggestively in Popiana than Pope's wealth. Faced with
the nasty fact that if one wrote well enough, there was a public to
support one, they could only accuse Pope monotonously of venality and
avarice.

In all of this there is a strong element of class antagonism. The Dunces
were middle-class and Whiggish, their spirit capitalist. Pope, though
middle-class by birth, was aristocratic in his sympathies, Tory in
a loose sense, and firmly anti-Walpole. Perhaps verse satire is
essentially aristocratic. Perhaps wit is, too. Certainly they never seem
at home in a middle-class society. Wit comes to savor of indecency and
blasphemy; satire in its incessant defence of moral value and centers
of order comes to seem the expression of an arrogant disdain and a
disquieting unease. His poise and verbal brilliance and hieratic
commitment to the venerable tradition of classical and Christian ethical
thought set the Satirist coolly apart from the _profanum vulgus_. Had
Pope never mentioned one of the Dunces, although they would have done
so less frequently, they would still have cried out against him.


II.

_One Epistle To Mr. A. Pope, Occasion'd By Two Epistles Lately
Published_ appeared, according to the _Daily Journal_, on 28 April
1730.[2] Pope's mention of it in Appendix II to _The Dunciad A_, his
"List of Books, Papers, and Verses, in which our Author was abused"
which is our best guide to Popiana, is somewhat confusing and made more
difficult because the first part dates from 1729, the second from 1735:
"_Labeo_, A Paper of Verses written by Leonard Welsted. [1729 a-d],
which after came into One Epistle, and was publish'd by James Moore.
4to. 1730. Another part of it came out in Welsted's own name in 1731,
under the just Title of _Dulness and Scandal_, fol. [1735a]."[3]

The _Labeo_ reference is mysterious. Pope in his note on Welsted to _The
Dunciad A_ II.293 had said in a sentence omitted in all editions from
1735a, "The strength of the metaphors in this passage is to express the
great scurrility and fury of this writer, which may be seen, One day, in
a Piece of his, call'd (as I think) _Labeo_."[4] Since no _Labeo_ has
ever turned up, it seems reasonable to conclude with Fineman that,
though Welsted may have toyed with the idea of writing one, "he either
never did enough with it to warrant its publication, or discarded it
entirely in favor of writing the collaborative _One Epistle to Mr. Pope_
that appeared in 1730. Naturally, he would not broadcast his plans, and
as a result the enemy camp continued to believe--or at any rate, to
say--that Welsted would retaliate with a _Labeo_.In country places
Postmasters are required to keep their offices open during the
usual hours of business in the locality, and to attend at such other
hours as may be necessary to receive and despatch the mails.

[Sidenote: Sundays, Canada West.]
On Sundays Postmasters in Canada West are at liberty to close their
offices to the public.

When an office in Canada West is closed to the public on Sunday it must
be closed to all persons alike, and no exceptional or partial delivery
to particular persons can be allowed.

[Sidenote: Sundays, Canada East.]
In Canada East, Postmasters keep their offices open on Sundays at
least one hour either before or after Divine Service, as may be
most convenient to the public generally.

[Sidenote: Notice of hours.]
A Notice, stating the hours at which the office is opened and closed,
should be posted in every office, in such a position as may be readily
observed by the public.

<tb>

MAILS.

[Sidenote: Canada railways.]
Mails are conveyed twice each way every day, except Sunday, over
the principal lines of railway in Canada.

  Over the less important lines of railway
  they are carried only once each way every day, except Sunday.

[Sidenote: Canada common roads.]
Mails are also conveyed once each way every day, except Sunday, over the
principal lines of common road, and once, twice, or three times per
week over the less important lines of common road.

[Sidenote: Lower Provinces.]
The postal communication between Canada and the Lower Provinces is three
times per week each way <i>viâ</i> Quebec, and once per fortnight each
way by Cunard Steamers <i>viâ</i> Boston and Halifax. Also twice per
week each way in summer <i>viâ</i> Portland.

[Sidenote: Postal routes to the several portions of the world].

The most speedy and direct postal route from Canada to almost every
portion of the globe, with the exception of the Continent of North
America, the Isthmus of Panama, and a portion of the West India
Islands having direct communication with New York, is by way of
England, from whence mails for the several British Colonies and
Foreign Countries mentioned in the tables at pages 36, 37, 38, and
39, are regularly despatched.
[Sidenote: Do. to North American Continent, Isthmus of Panama,
W.
Indies, &c.]
The most speedy and direct postal route from Canada to all parts
of the Continent of North America, the Isthmus of Panama, and a
portion of the West India Islands having direct communication with
New York, is <i>viâ</i>
New York.
[Sidenote: Mails for England.]
Mails for England are despatched twice in each week from Canada,
viz.:
once by Canadian Steamer sailing every Saturday, from Quebec in
Summer and from Portland in Winter; and once by Cunard Steamer,
sailing every Wednesday, either from New York or Boston.
The following Post Offices in Canada make up mails direct for certain
Post Offices in the United Kingdom, viz.:--
Hamilton, Montreal, Toronto, Quebec.
Kingston,
[Sidenote: Mails for United States.]
Mails are exchanged daily with the United States post offices at
all the principal frontier points, and closed mails are exchanged
daily between the principal cities of Canada and New York and
Boston.

[Sidenote: Mails for Lower Provinces.]
Mails are also made up at Quebec, Montreal, and Toronto, for Halifax,
Nova Scotia, and for St. John's, Newfoundland, and despatched to
destination by Cunard Steamer, sailing from Boston, every alternate
Wednesday.In 1724 in the "Dissertation concerning the Perfection of the
English Language" prefixed to his _Epistles, Odes, &c._, Welsted quoted
(not quite correctly) and criticized Pope's "And such as _Chaucer_ is,
shall _Dryden_ be" (p. x). The anonymous author of _Characters of The
Times_ (1728) thought that Welsted would have been spared Pope's abuse
if he had not in his "Dissertation" "happen'd to cite a low and false
line from Mr. P[o]pe for the meer Purpose of refuting it, without
seeming to know, or care who was the Author of it" (p. 24).[12]

In the _Peri Bathous_ Pope included Welsted as a didapper and an eel.
Pope then put him into _The Dunciad_ in II.293-300 and, more memorably,
in III.163-166:

  Flow Welsted, Flow! like thine inspirer, Beer,
  Tho' stale, not ripe; tho' thin, yet never clear;
  So sweetly mawkish, and so smoothly dull;
  Heady, not strong, and foaming tho' not full.

Unable to leave well enough alone, Welsted continued his attack on Pope
with _One Epistle_ and then again in January 1732 with _Of Dulness and
Scandal_, which ran to three editions. The half-title of _One Epistle_
had promised that it was to be continued, and the writer of the preface
had said that he intended "in the preface to the next Epistle ... to
state several Matters of Fact, in Contradiction to the Notes of the
_Dunciad_" (p. viii). _Of Dulness and Scandal_, however, has no preface
and is an independent attack. Its main charge is Pope's ingratitude to
the Duke of Chandos as shown in the _Epistle to Burlington_, a famous
charge frequently to be repeated,[13] but it claims as well that a lady
named Victoria died as a result of reading Pope's Homer and attacks once
more _The Rape of the Lock_ and the _First Psalm_.

In February 1732 Welsted published his last attack on Pope, _Of False
Fame_, in which he attacks _Windsor Forest_, _The Rape of the Lock_,
Pope's edition of Shakespeare, _The Dunciad_, and the _Epistle to
Burlington_. Pope then mentioned him in the _Epistle to Arbuthnot_, at
first in l. 49, although he altered this to "Pitholeon," and then in
l. 375, where most twentieth-century college students first meet his
name.

The charges in _One Epistle_ are unusually comprehensive, but almost
none of them is original. To help the reader to evaluate the more
important, the following notes may be helpful. The denial in the preface
of Pope's statement that no one is attacked in _The Dunciad_ "who had
not before, either in Print or private Conversation, endeavour'd
something to his Disadvantage" (p. v) is a reference to _The Dunciad_,
p. 203, where, however, conversation is not mentioned. This sentence of
Pope's annoyed many of the Dunces.[14] What the preface says about Swift
and Arbuthnot and the _Peri Bathous_ (p. vii) may well be true.[15]
Welsted's charge that Pope wrote the Prologue to _Cato_ and then "the
Play decried" (p. 12) is simply Dennis's old charge first made in
_A True Character of Mr. Pope (1716)_ and repeated in _Remarks Upon ...
the Dunciad_ (1729) that Pope had teased Lintot into publishing Dennis's
attack on _Cato_. The charge rests only on Dennis's authority.[16] The
obscenity of _The Rape of the Lock_ was an old story.[17] So was the
notorious _First Psalm_.[18] Welsted's attacks on the _Pastorals_, the
Homer, the _Peri Bathous_, and _The Dunciad_ are simply the commonplaces
of Popiana. The charge that he libeled Addison only after the great
man's death is also familiar[19] (Welsted seems to have been the first,
though, to mention the libel on Lady Mary) and long since disproved by
Sherburn and Ault. That Pope was a plagiarist is an idea that turns up
constantly.[20]

Welsted's other charges are more interesting. He seems to be the only
Dunce who objected (p. 12) to Pope's mentioning Bishop Hoadly in _The
Dunciad A_ II.368. It may just possibly be true that Gildon was
dismissed by Buckingham because of Gildon's dislike of Pope (p. 22).[21]

The most curious of the charges is that Pope,

    ... from the Skies, propitious to the Fair,
  Brought down _Caecilia_, and sent _Cloris_ there. (p. 11)

Welsted apparently means that Pope debased St. Cecilia in his _Ode for
Musick on St. Cecilia's Day_ and glorified a suicide in his _Elegy to
the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady_. He is not saying, as did _The Life
of the late Celebrated Mrs. Elizabeth Wisebourn_ (1721), that the
heroine of the _Elegy_ died of her unrequited love for Pope. Pope's
note to l. 375 of the _Epistle to Arbuthnot_ accusing Welsted of having
"had the Impudence to tell in print, that Mr. _P._ had occasion'd a
Lady's death, and to _name_ a person he never heard of" refers not to
Cloris but to Victoria in Welsted's _Of Dulness and Scandal_ who died
from reading Pope's _Illiad_.[22]

The _Grub-Street Journal_ for 21 May 1730 invited "any Person of Credit
and Character to stand forth and attest any of the following Facts...."

  That the late Duke of Buckingham paid any Pension to Charles Gildon,
  which he took from him since his acquaintance with Mr. P.

  That the present Archbishop of Canterbury hath past any Censure on
  Mr. P.

  That Mr. F[ento]n and he ever were at distance on variance with each
  other.

  That the Rev. Mr. Br[oo]me ever asserted or complain'd, he was not
  gratify'd with a competent Sum for his Share in the Odyssey; nay did
  not own that he thought himself highly paid.

  That Mr. Addison or any other but Mr. P. writ, or alter'd, one line
  of the Prologue to Cato.

  Who will name any young Writer, allow'd to have Merit, that hath
  been personally discourag'd by him; or who hath not received either
  actual Services, or amicable Treatment from him?


III.

_The Blatant Beast_ appeared in December 1742, according to _The London
Magazine_; its authorship remains unknown. Pope had published _The New
Dunciad_ in March 1742, and Cibber had published his famous _A Letter
From Mr. Cibber, To Mr. Pope_ in July. Five other pamphlets attacking
Pope appeared in August, obviously capitalizing on the Cibber attack.

_The Blatant Beast_ is pro-Cibber, of course, but it criticizes
specifically only a few lines from _The New Dunciad_. The writer's chief
interest is in a general attack. The criticisms of the Shakespeare, of
_Three Hours_ and the _Epistle to Burlington_, and of Pope's plagiarism
are perfectly conventional. More interesting is the accusation (p. 6)
that Pope wrote (as, of course, he did) his Homer on the backs of
personal letters. Also interesting is the reference to Pope's
inscription on the Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey (p. 5).
Pope was, with several others, responsible for the Latin inscription;
it does not seem that he had anything to do with the lines from _The
Tempest_ IV. i. 152-156, which were added several months later. These
lines are given in the first note to _The Dunciad B_ I. and, in slightly
different form, in _The Gentleman's Magazine_, XI, 276. The last line
reads, "Leave not a wreck behind." Pope's version of the lines in both
his 1725 and 1728 editions of Shakespeare (Griffith 149 and 210) does
not commit the errors of the inscription and prints, "Leave not a rack
behind!"[23] The bantering note about the monument which begins _The
Dunciad B_ may have been prompted by this passage in _The Blatant Beast_
as well as by the comment of Theobald which Sutherland refers to.

New Brunswick, however, continued to be included in it. The postmasters
in that Province being commissioned at Quebec and accounting to
the Deputy Postmaster General there.

  In the year 1817 Lower Canada had 13 post
  offices; Upper Canada, 12; Nova Scotia, 6; New Brunswick, 3; Prince
Edward's Island, 1.

  In this year the mails were running between Quebec and Halifax once
a fortnight, all the year round; between Quebec and Kingston, once
a week; between Kingston and Toronto, once a week; and between
Toronto and Amherstburg, once a fortnight.

In the year 1820 there were in Lower Canada 20 post offices; in Upper
Canada, 19; in Nova Scotia, 6; in New Brunswick, 3; in Prince Edward's
Island, 1.

In 1824 there were in Upper and Lower Canada 69 post offices, and 1992
miles of established mail routes. The annual travel of the mail was
370,000 miles. The gross revenue was $68,000; and the revenue transmitted
to England, after deducting $1200, the supposed surplus for New
Brunswick, $21,000.

At this time the population of Lower Canada was about 440,000,
and of Upper Canada 150,000.

In this year Mr. Sutherland was succeeded, as Deputy Postmaster General,
by Mr. Thos. A. Stayner, and shortly after was effected the separation
of nearly the whole of New Brunswick from the Canada charge.

Under the long and able administration of Mr. Stayner, extending from
the year 1824 to 1851, postal accommodation was greatly extended
throughout Upper and Lower Canada.

In 1827 there were 101 post offices and 2368 miles of established post
route. The annual transportation of the mail was 455,000 miles. The
estimated number of letters passing through the post in the year was
340,000; the estimated number of papers, 400,000.

In the year 1832 the Duke of Richmond, then Postmaster General, proposed
a re-modification of the post office throughout British North America.

An Act was prepared with this object, but the attempt to pass it through
the several Legislatures failed, and of all the plans that had
been contemplated only two were carried into effect, namely, the
establishment of an Accountant's Office and the appointment of Local
Inspectors.

The attention of the Legislature of Upper Canada was, about this
time, frequently turned to the post office, which still continued
under the Imperial control. Committees were appointed and reports made,
in which the transfer of the management of the department to the Colonial
Government was strongly urged.

  In the year 1837 a joint address from the Legislative Council and
Assembly was adopted, praying that the revenue produced by the post
office in the Colonies should no longer be remitted to England.

This address was referred to the Lords of the Treasury, and by them
referred to Lord Durham, on the ground that some general measure
was required to carry its prayer into effect.

Nothing, however, was done until some years afterwards towards the
accomplishment of this end.

A large and steady increase continued to take place yearly in the
business and revenue of the post office. In 1838 there were 380
post offices, and 5486 miles of established post route.

The annual transportation of the mail was 1,345,000 miles; the estimated
number of letters carried, 1,000,000; the estimated number of newspapers,
1,250,000; and the gross revenue, $146,000.

The following extract from the Quebec <i>Mercury</i>, published on the
18th July, 1829, conveys some idea of the postal communication with
England at that period:--
"No later advices have been received from Europe since our last. Some
further extracts from the London papers, to 31st May inclusive, brought
to New York by the 'Corinthian,' will be found in another part of
this number."For Labeo see

  THE

  PREFACE.


_The indecent Images, and the frequent and bad Imitations of the
Classics in the _Dunciad_, have occasioned several just Observations
upon so new and coarse a Manner of Writing: I shall wave this Topic at
present, and only regard the most plausible Insinuation in Favour of
this Author; which is, that he never begun an Attack upon any Person,
who had not before, either in Print or private Conversation, endeavour'd
something to his Disadvantage._

_This Assertion is by no means true, as I shall immediately shew; if
it were true, it might indeed bear some Weight, but however with this
Distinction, that the Reports of private Conversation, brought to him by
such Emissaries, as belong to him, are not always to be believed, and
that no Attack in Print upon a Man's Poetical Character, ought to be
repaid by Lampoon and Virulence upon the Moral Character of his
Antagonist: Every Person has a Right to determine upon the Talents of
Writers, particularly of one, who appears in Publick only to gratify
the two worst Appetites, that disgrace Human Nature, I mean Malice and
Avarice; and sure no Man deserves a violent Injury to his Reputation,
as a Gentleman, because perhaps at a Distance of several Years since
he might have said, that Mr. _Pope_ had nothing in him Original as a
Writer, that Mr. _Tickel_ greatly excelled him in his Translation of
_Homer_, and many of his Contemporaries in other Branches of Writing,
and that he is infinitely inferior to Mr. _Phillips_ in Pastoral: And
yet such Arguments or Apologies as these have been used by himself,
or his Tea-Table Cabals, for calling Gentlemen Scoundrels, Blockheads,
Gareteers, and Beggars,: If he can transmit them to Posterity under
such Imputations, he is a bad Man; if he cannot, he is a bad Writer:
I believe, that he would rather suffer under the first Character, than
the last: But before I have done with him, I will make a very strict
Inquiry into both._

_In the mean time I shall shew the Reader, in general, the Falshood of
his main Pretence, that he has meddled with no one, that had not before
hurt him, and in this View, tho' I should be ashamed of being too
serious in a Controversy of this Sort, I think it proper to acquaint the
Town with the original Design of the _Dunciad_, and the real Reasons of
its Production. This Piece, which has been honour'd by Booksellers of
Quality, contains only the Poetical Part of Dulness, extracted from a
Libel, call'd, _The Progress of it_, and which included several other
Branches of Science, and perhaps some of those Gentlemen, who have in
the warmest Manner asserted the Cause of the _Dunciad_, might have seen
a Publication of a Work, upon the Death of this Writer, in which no past
Friendship could have screen'd them from Lampoon for any Pretences to
excel in any Science whatever: It appears, therefore, that he was teaz'd
into a Publication of these Cantos, which regarded the Writers of the
Age, by some Attacks, that were made upon him about that Time: We must
refer to a Miscellany of Poems published by Him and _Swift_, to which
is prefix'd, _An Essay on the Profund_, to consider if those Attacks
were justifiable; Mr. Dean _Swift_ never saw the _Profund_, till made
publick, and Dr. _Arburthnot_, who originally sketch'd the Design of it,
desired that the Initial Letters of Names of the Gentlemen abused might
not be inserted, that they might be _A_ or _B_, or _Do_ or _Ro_, or any
thing of that Nature, which would make this Satire a general one upon
any dull Writers in any Age: This was refused by _Pope_, and he chose
rather to treat a Set of Gentlemen as Vermin, Reptiles, _&c._ at a Time
when he had no Provocation to do so, when he had closed his Labours,
finish'd his great Subscriptions, and was in a fashionable Degree of
Reputation: Several Gentlemen, who are there ranked with the dullest
Men, or dullest Beasts, never did appear in Print against him, or say
any thing in Conversation which might affect his Character: Some
Replies, which were made to the _Profund_, occasioned the Publication of
the _Dunciad_, which was first of all begun with a general Malice to all
Mankind, and now appears under an Excuse of Provocations, which he had
received, after he himself had struck the first Blow in the
above-mentioned Miscellanies._

_I cannot indeed say much in Praise of some Performances, which appear'd
against him, and am sorry that Voluntiers enter'd into the War, whom I
could wish to have been only Spectators: But the Cause became so
general, that some Gentlemen, who never aim'd at the Laurel, grew Poets
merely upon their being angry: A Militia, in Case of publick Invasion,
may perhaps be thought necessary, but yet one could always wish for
an Army of regular Troops: I should not have touched upon this
Circumstance, but to obviate some Imputations, which he had suggested,
of my Writing several Pieces, which I never heard of, till I saw them
with the rest of the Town: But these Suggestions shall be considered in
the Preface to the next Epistle, in which, among other Things, I intend
to state several Matters of Fact, in Contradiction to the Notes of the
_Dunciad_, particularly as they concern the Writers of the following
Poem._

  E P I S T L E

  to

  Mr. _A.  P O P E_,

  Occasion'd By

  Two Lately Publish'd.

  If noble _B----m_, (a) in Metre known,
  With Strains has grac'd thee, humble as thy own;
  Who (b) _G--l--n_'s Dullness did for thine discard,
  A better Critick, for as bad a Bard!
  Not unregarded let this Tribute be,
  Tho' humble, just; well-bred, tho' paid to Thee.

    _Parnassian_ Groves, and _Twick'nam_ Fountains, say,
  What Homage to the Bard shall _Britain_ pay!
  The Bard! that first, from _Dryden's_ thrice-glean'd Page,
  Cull'd his low Efforts to Poetic Rage;
  Nor pillag'd only that unrival'd Strain,
  But rak'd for Couplets [1] _Chapman_ and _Duck-Lane_,
  Has sweat each Cent'ry's Rubbish to explore,
  And plunder'd every Dunce that writ before,
  Catching half Lines, till the tun'd Verse went round,
  Complete, in smooth dull (c) Unity of Sound;
  Who, stealing Human, scorn'd Celestial Fire,
  And strung to _Smithfield_ Airs the [2] _Hebrew_ Lyre;
  Who taught declining (d) _Wycherley_ to doze
  O'er wire-drawn Sense, that tinkled in the Close,
  To lovely _F----r_ impious and obscene,
  To mud-born _Naiads_ faithfully unclean;
  Whose raptur'd Nonsense, with Prophetick Skill,
  First taught that Ombre, which fore-ran Quadrille;
  Who from the Skies, propitious to the Fair,
  Brought down _Cæcilia_, and sent [3] _Cloris_ there,
  Censur'd by _W--ke_, by _A------ry_ blest,
  Prais'd _Sw----t_ in Earnest, and sung Heav'n in Jest,
  Here, mov'd by Whim, and there by Envy stung,
  Would flatter _Ch----s_, or would libel [4] _Y----ge_,
  By _F----n_ left, by Reverend Linguists hated,
  Now learns to read the _Greek_ he once translated.

    [Footnote 1: A Translator of _Homer_.]

    [Footnote 2: Burlesque of the first _Psalm_, more profest than
    _Sternbold's_.]

    [Footnote 3: See Verses, in _P--pe_'s Poems, to the Memory of an
    unfortunate young Lady.]

    [Footnote 4: _Sir W. Y._]

    Oh say, to him what Trophies shall be rais'd,
  That unprovok'd will strike, and fawn unprais'd!
  Each fav'rite Toast who marks, or rising Wit,
  To sketch a Satire, that in Time may fit;
  Still hopes your Sun-set, while he views your Noon,
  And still broods o'er the closely-kept Lampoon;
  The lurking Presents o'er the Tomb he paid,
  And thus atton'd our _British Virgil_'s Shade,
  A Mushroom [1] Satire in his Life conceal'd,
  Since chang'd to Libel, and in Print reveal'd;
  Who lets not [2] Beauty base Detraction 'scape,
  And mocks Deformity with _Æsop_'s Shape;
  Who _Cato_'s Muse with faithless Sneers belied,
  The Prologue father'd, and the Play decried,
  On [3] _H----y_'s learned Page, dull-sporting trod,
  Betray'd his Patrons, and lampoon'd his God;
  Translator, Editor, could far out-go
  In _Homer_ _Ogleby_, in _Shakespeare_ _R----_
  O! how burlesqu'd, great _Dryden_, is thy Strain,
  When little _Alexander_ [4] _slays the Slain_!

    [Footnote 1: Libel on Mr. _Addison_ in _P--pe_ and _Sw--t_'s
    Miscellanies.]

    [Footnote 4: See _Dryden_'s Ode on St. _Cæcilia_'s Day.

        ------Fought all his Battles o'er again;
        ------And thrice he _slew the Slain_.]

    On, mighty Rhimer, haste new Palms to seize,
  Thy little, envious, angry Genius teize;
  Let thy weak wilful Head, unrein'd by Art,
  Obey the Dictates of thy flatt'ring Heart;
  Divide a busy, fretful Life between
  Smut, Libel, Sing-song, Vanity, and Spleen;
  With long-brew'd Malice warm thy languid Page,
  And urge delirious Nonsense into Rage;
  Let bawdy Emblems, now, thy Hours beguile;
  Now, Fustian Epic, aping _Virgil_'s Stile;
  To _Virgil_ like, to _Indian_ Clay as _Delf_,
  Or _Pulteney_, drawn by _Jervase_, to Herself:
  Rheams heap'd on Rheams, incessant, mayst thou blot,
  A lively, trifling, pert, one knows not what!
  Form thy light Measures, nimbler than the Wind,
  Whilst heavy lingring Sense is left behind;
  With all thy Might pursue, and all thy Will,
  That unabating Thirst, to scribble still,
  Giv'n at thy Birth! the Poetaster's Gust,
  False and unsated as the Eunuch's Lust!

    Illustrious Fops, mean time, o'er-rate thy Lays,
  And blooming Critics, as they spell thee, praise:
  Blest Coupleteer! by blooming Critics read,
  At Toilets _ogled_, and with Sweetmeats fed:
  See, lisping Toilers grace thy _Dunciad_'s Cause,
  And scream their witty Scavenger's Applause,
  While powder'd Wits, and lac'd Cabals rehearse
  Thy bawdy _Cento_, and thy _Bead-roll_ Verse;
  Gay, bugled Statesmen on thy Side debate,
  And libel'd Blockheads court thee, tho' they hate.
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  Fools of all Kinds their Suffrages impart,
  The Fools of Nature, and the Fools of Art.

    These in thy threadbare Farce shall Beauties show,
  Shall praise thy ribald Mirth, and maudlin Woe;
  Praise ev'n thy imitating _Chaucer_'s Tales,
  And call that merry [1] Temple, Fame's _Versailles_:
  Thy [2] Shepherd-Song with Rapture they shall see,
  Which rivals _Philips_, as _Banks_ rivals _Lee_;
  Thy [3] _Guernsey_ and _Barbados_ Wreath shall own,
  Where _Durfey_ ne'er was read, nor _Settle_ known;
  That Wreath, that Name, which thro' both Worlds is gone,
  Which Doctor (e) _Y----_ applauds, and _Prestor John_.

    [Footnote 1: Temple of Fame by _P----_]

    [Footnote 2: _P----pe_'s Pastorals.]

    [Footnote 3: See the Original Preface to the _Dunciad_.]

    Lo! as _Anchises_, to the Goddess-born,
  So I the Worthies, that thy Page adorn,
  Point out to Thee.----See [1] here * * * *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  The Prelate! next, exil'd by cruel Fates,
  Who plagues all Churches, and confounds all States;
  With Treasons past perplex'd, and present Cares;
  A Fop in Rhime, and Bungler in Affairs.
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  And here! a Groupe of Brother Quill-men see,
  Co-witlings all, and Demi-bards like Thee;
  Such whom the Muse shall pass with just Disdain,
  Nor add one Trophy to thy mottly Train:
  But Quack _Arb----t_ shall Oblivion blot,
  That puzzling, plodding, prating, pedant _Scot_!
  The grating Scribler! whose untun'd Essays
  Mix the _Scotch_ Thistle with the _English_ Bays,
  By either _Phoebus_ pre-ordain'd to Ill,
  The Hand prescribing, or the flattering Quill,
  Who doubly plagues, and boasts two Arts to kill!

    [Footnote 1: The Characters left out here may perhaps be inserted
    in some future Edition of this Poem.]

    'Midst this vain Tribe, that aid thy setting Ray,
  The Muse shall view, but spare ill-faced _G--y_:
  Poor (f) _G--y_, who loses most when most he wins.
  And gives his Foes his Fame, and bears their Sins;
  Who more by Fortune than by Nature curst,
  Yields his best Pieces, and must own _Thy_ worst.

    Thus prop'd, thy Head with _Grub-street_ Zephyrs tainted,
  By (g) _Rich_ recorded, and by _J----_ painted;
  _J----!_ who so refin'd a Rake is reckon'd,
  He breaks all (h) _Sinai_'s Laws, except the Second:
  Thus prais'd, thus drawn, t'extend thy Projects try,
  Leave the _Blue [1] Languish_, and the Crimson Sigh;
  Leave the gay Epithets that Beauty crown,
  White [2] _Whitylinda_, and _Brownissa_ Brown;
  Forget awhile (i) _Belinda_ and the Sun;
  Forget the _Fights of Stand_, and Flights of Run:
  No more let _Ombre_'s Play inspire thy Vein,
  Nor strow with Captive Kings the [3] _Velvet Plain_;
  Omit awhile the _Silver Peal_ to ring,      }
  Nor talk dulcissant, nor mellifluous sing,  }
  Nor _hang suspended_, nor _adherent cling_. }
  But haste to mount Immortal Envy's Throne,
  To crush all Merit, that disputes thy own;
  For thou wert born to damp each rising Name,
  And hang, like Mildews, on the Growth of Fame;
  Fame's fairest Blossoms let thy Rancour blast,
  Bane of the modern Laurel, like the past;
  While stupid Riot stands in Humour's Place,
  And bestial Filth, Humanity's Disgrace,
  Low Lewdness, unexcited by Desire,
  And all great [4] _Wilmot_'s Vice, without his Fire.

    [Footnote 1: The Phrases distinguished here in _Italics_, are
    truly quoted from _P----pe_; and the others in Company with them,
    ought to be in no other Company.]

    [Footnote 2: See _Dunciad_. _Nigrina_ Black.]

    [Footnote 3: Here a Card Table; in _P--pe_, a Field of Grass.]

    [Footnote 4: _Wilmot_, Earl of _Rochester_.]

    At length, when banish'd _Pallas_ shall withdraw,
  And Wit's made Treason by the _Popian_ Law;
  When minor Dunces cease, at length, their Strife,
  And own thy Patent to be dull for Life;
  By Tricks sustain'd, in Poet-craft compleat,
  Retire triumphant to thy _Twick'nam_ Seat;
  That Seat! the Work of (k) half-paid drudging _Br----me_,
  And call'd by joking _Tritons_, _Homer_'s Tomb:
  There to stale, stol'n, stum Crambo bid adieu,
  And sneer the Fops, that thought thy Crambo new;
  There, like the _Grecian_ Chief, on whom thy Song
  Has well reveng'd unhappy _Priam_'s Wrong;
  Waste, in thy hidden Cave, the Festive Day,
  With mock _Machaon_, and _Patroclus G----_
  _Sleep_, (l) _Sleep in Peace_ the Works, for _Wapping_ born!
  No more thy Cuckoo Note shall wake the Morn;
  In Ease, and Avarice, and aukward State,
  _The Fool of Fortune_, shalt thou hail thy Fate;
  Slumbring in Quiet o'er Lampoons half writ,
  Which, ripe in Malice, only wait for Wit.

    So when _Vanessa_ yielded up her Charms,
  The blest _Cadenus_ languish'd in her Arms;
  High, on a Peg, his unbrush'd Beaver hung,
  His Vest unbutton'd, and his God unsung;
  Raptur'd he lies; Deans, Authors are forgot,
  _Wood_'s Copper Pence, and _Atterbury_'s Plot;
  For her he quits the Tythes of _Patrick_'s Fields,
  And all the Levite to the Lover yields.

NOTES

On the Foregoing

POEM.


(a) _If Noble _B------m_,_

The late Duke of _Buckingham!_ who made that fine Alteration of the
Tragedy of _Julius Cæsar_ from _Shakespeare_, and who is said by Mr.
_Pope_ to have bestow'd the finest Praise upon _Homer_ that he ever
received, in the following Lines;

  Read _Homer_ once, and you need read no more;
  For all Things else will be so mean and poor,
  Verse will seem Prose: Yet often on him look,
  And you will never need another Book.

    D---- of B----'s Essay on Poetry.

He has also printed a Copy of Verses in Praise of _Pope_, which were
returned by another in Praise of his Grace. There is so great a
Similitude in the Stile of these Writers, that the Reader, I think, need
not doubt their Sincerity in admiring each other.

  'Tis great Delight to laugh at some Mens Ways;
  But 'tis much greater to give Merit Praise.

    D---- of B----.

  _Sheffield_ approves, consenting _Phoebus_ bends,
  And I and Malice from this Hour, am Friends.

    Pope.


(b) _Who _G------n_'s Dulness------_

_Charles Gildon_, dismiss'd from the D----'s Pension and Favour, on
Account of his Obstinacy in refusing to take the Oaths to _P--pe_'s
Supremacy.


(c) _Smooth dull Unity of Sound._

_P--pe_'s Reputation for versifying is a vulgar Error, founded only on
discreet Theft: Half a Line from Mr. _Dryden_'s _Conquest of Mexico_,
and another from his Translation of _Virgil_, have seemingly made
tolerable Music, when join'd in his Works; but Music of the _Morocco_
Kind, which has but one Note.


(d) _Who taught declining _Wycherley_------_

Mr. _Wycherley_ subscribed to a Compliment (some say, before his Death)
upon _P--pe_'s Pastorals, in which he says, his _Arcadia speaks the
Language of the Mall_, but does not explain, whether he means at Noon or
Night. I do not agree with what Mr. _Wycherley_ is supposed to have writ
of him, but I do with what he certainly said of him, _viz._ _That he was
not able to make a Suit of Cloaths, but could perhaps turn an old Coat._


(e) _Which Doctor _Y------__

The Reverend Doctor _Edward Young_, who, in this Quarrel of the great
contending Powers in Poesy, has been courted by all Sides: But some late
Incidents give a Suspicion, that he has privately acceded to the _Treaty
of Twickenham_.


(f) _Poor _G----_, who loses most----_

Mr. _Gay_, not thought to be the entire Author of the _Beggar's Opera_,
and ordered to own _Three Hours after Marriage_.


(g) _By _Rich_ recorded------_

_Gilbert Pickering Rich._ A great Admirer of _P--pe_, eminent for his
Translation of _Horace_, which can be equall'd by nothing but _P--pe_'s
translating of _Homer_. He concludes the first Ode by giving (_sublimi
feriam sidera vertice_) in these Words;

  I'll bound, I'll spring, I'll strike the weaken'd Pole,
  I'll knock so hard, I'll knock thro' it a Hole.


Rise, poor pretender!

Think'st thou To please with genuflex on my vain heart, As if I were a
weak, confiding girl?

You err, my friend; prone at my feet I've seen Knights and counts
nobly born; but not for this Did I reject their prayers, that a
poor monk-- 
PRETENDER.

(Rises.) Scorn not the young pretender; noble virtues May lie perchance
in him, virtues well worthy Of Moscow's throne, even of thy priceless
hand--

  MARINA. Say of a shameful noose, insolent
  wretch!

PRETENDER.

      I am to blame; carried away by pride I have deceived God and the
kings--have lied To the world; but it is not for thee, Marina, To
judge me; I am guiltless before thee.

No, I could not deceive thee.

Thou to me Wast the one sacred being, before thee I dared not to
dissemble; love alone, Love, jealous, blind, constrained me to tell
all.

MARINA. What's that to boast of, idiot? Who demanded Confession of thee?
If thou, a nameless vagrant Couldst wonderfully blind two nations, then
At least thou shouldst have merited success, And thy bold fraud
secured, by constant, deep, And lasting secrecy.

Say, can I yield Myself to thee, can I, forgetting rank And maiden
modesty, unite my fate With thine, when thou thyself impetuously
Dost thus with such simplicity reveal Thy shame?

It was from Love he blabbed to me!
I marvel wherefore thou hast not from friendship Disclosed thyself
ere now before my father, Or else before our king from joy, or else
Before Prince Vishnevetsky from the zeal Of a devoted servant.

  PRETENDER. I swear to thee That thou alone wast
  able to extort My heart's confession; I swear to thee that never,
Nowhere, not in the feast, not in the cup Of folly, not in friendly
confidence, Not 'neath the knife nor tortures of the rack, Shall
my tongue give away these weighty secrets.

    MARINA. Thou swearest! Then I must believe.
  Believe, Of course! But may I learn by what
  thou swearest?
  Is it not by the name of God, as suits The
  Jesuits' devout adopted son?
  Or by thy honour as a high-born knight?
  Or, maybe, by thy royal word alone As a king's
  son? Is it not so? Declare.

  PRETENDER.

       (Proudly.) The phantom of the
           Terrible hath made me His son; from out the sepulchre hath named
me Dimitry, hath stirred up the people round me, And hath consigned
Boris to be my victim.

I am tsarevich. Enough!

'Twere shame for me To stoop before a haughty Polish dame.
Farewell for ever; the game of bloody war, The wide cares of my
destiny, will smother, I hope, the pangs Of love.

  O, when the heat Of shameful passion is o'erspent, how then Shall
I detest thee!

  Now I leave thee--ruin, Or else a crown, awaits my head in Russia;
Whether I meet with death as fits a soldier In honourable fight,
or as a miscreant Upon the public scaffold, thou shalt not Be my
companion, nor shalt share with me My fate; but it may be thou shalt
regret The destiny thou hast refused.

  MARINA.

  But what If I expose beforehand thy bold fraud To all men?

  PRETENDER. Dost thou think I fear thee? Think'st
    thou They will believe a Polish maiden
  more Than Russia's own tsarevich? Know,
  proud lady, That neither king, nor pope, nor nobles
          trouble Whether my words be true, whether I be Dimitry or another.

    What care they?
  But I provide a pretext for revolt And war;
  and this is all they need; and thee, Rebellious
  one, believe me, they will force To hold
          thy peace.

  Farewell.

  

  MARINA. Tsarevich, stay!
  At last I hear the speech not of a boy, But of a man.

  It reconciles me to thee.

  Prince, I forget thy senseless outburst, see Again Dimitry.

  Listen; now is the time!

  Hasten; delay no more, lead on thy troops Quickly to Moscow, purge
the Kremlin, take Thy seat upon the throne of Moscow; then Send me
the nuptial envoy; but, God hears me, Until thy foot be planted on
its steps, Until by thee Boris be overthrown, I am not one to listen
to love-speeches.

  PRETENDER.

  No--easier far to strive with Godunov.

  Or play false with the Jesuits of the Court,
  Than with a woman. Deuce take them; they're
  beyond My power. She twists, and
  coils, and crawls, slips out Of hand, she hisses,
  threatens, bites. Ah, serpent!
  Serpent! 'Twas not for nothing that I
  trembled.
  She well-nigh ruined me; but I'm resolved; At
  daybreak I will put my troops in motion.
  

    Horrid to view! retire from human Sight,
  Nor with thy Figure pregnant Dames affright.
  Crawl thro' thy childish Grot, growl round thy Grove,
  A Foe to Man, an Antidote to Love.
  In Curses waste thy Time instead of Pray'r,
  (a) And with thy Breath pollute the fragrant Air.
  There doze o'er _Shakespear_; then thy Blunders fell
  (b) At mighty Price; this Truth let _Tonson_ tell.
  Then frontless intimate, (oh perjur'd Bard!)
  Thy Labours were bestow'd without Reward.
  On that immortal Author wreak thy Spite,
  (c) And on his Monument thy Nonsense write.
  Should _Theobald_ thy presumptuous Errors shew,
  Be thou to _Theobald_ an invet'rate Foe.
  _Cibber_ shall foremost in thy Satyrs stand;
  His Plays succeed, and thine was justly damn'd.
  But _Colley_ call him, when thou would'st declame;
  Great is the Jest that lies in _Colley_'s Name.

    [Footnote a: It is surely allowable to treat a Man after this
    manner who abuses all others, and to make this just Reflexion,
    since in his new _Dunciad_ he not only calls _Mummius_ a Fool,
    but uses this filthy Expression--who stinks above the Ground.]

    [Footnote b: See this farther explained in the ingenious Dialogues
    of _Sawney_ and _Colley_.]

    [Footnote c: Tho' he was informed that Wreck was improper, yet he
    was resolv'd it should be inscrib'd, because the Nonsense was in
    his Edition of _Shakespear_.]

    Beware all ye, whom he as Friends carest,
  How ye entrust your Secrets to his Breast.
  (a) On Backs of Letters was his _Homer_ wrote,
  All your Affairs disclos'd to save a Groat.
  He valu'd not to whom he gave Offence;
  He sav'd his Paper, tho' at your Expence.

    [Footnote a: When he sent his _Homer_ to his Acquaintance for
    their Emendations, it was written on the Back of the Letters of
    his Correspondents, whether of Business, Complement or Secrecy.
    A shameful Instance of Avarice and Treachery!]

    But shall a low-born Wretch the best traduce,
  And call it Poetry, because Abuse?
  The Heav'n-born Muse, by Truth and Justice sway'd,
  To false Aspersions ne'er vouchsafes her Aid.
  When unprovok'd, not vengeful Wasps molest,
  Nor dart their Stings, when undisturb'd their Nest.
  Thy Muse, by _Virgil_'s Harpies taught to write,
  Scatters her Ordure in her screaming Flight;
  Sacred Religion and her Priests defames,
  And against Monarchs saucily exclames.
  (a) The Fathers, of our Church the surest Guides,
  As a poor Pack of Punsters she derides.
  But chief O _Cam!_ and _Isis!_ dread her Frown,
  (b) Chain'd to the Footstool of the Goddess' Throne.
  No Order, no Degree escapes her Rage,
  And dull, and dull, and dull swells ev'ry Page.
  Thirsty, she Poison draws from ev'ry Flow'r,
  Like Satan, seeks whom next she may devour.

    [Footnote a: _Vide_ Notes on the new _Dunciad_.]

    [Footnote b: Goddess of Dullness.]

    So have I seen a Dog distracted roam;
  He bites, he snaps at all, disgorging Foam.
  The frighten'd Passenger the Danger flies,
  And sees the Poison flashing from his Eyes.
  Till some stout Dray-man dashes out his Brains,
  And his corrupted Blood the Kennel stains.

    Thy Notes pedantic shall no more engage;
  _Arbuthnot_'s Wit enlivens not the Page.
  Thy Muse, that Prostitute abandon'd Jade,
  Now flounders in the Mire without _Swift_'s Aid.
  Thy base Invectives Men no more regard;
  With just Disdain thy Scare-Crow Muse is heard.

    So when the latent Seeds their Fruits display,
  And gain fresh Vigour from a genial Ray:
  The careful Hind a monst'rous Figure frames;
  From various Rags unwonted Terror streams.
  The feather'd Choristers in Flocks retreat,
  And at a Distance view the tempting Bait.
  At length grown bold, they perch upon his Head,
  And with their Meute bedawb what late they fled.

    _B-ns-n_ abuse for raising _Milton_'s Bust,
  And impiously molest learn'd _Johnston_'s Dust.
  Religious, he the Psalms in _Latin_ sung,
  From hence the Malice of the Deist sprung.
  While with a just Derision we survey,
  Thy wretched Epitaph on poor _John Gay_.

    Had _Peter_, _Charters_ thee with Gold supply'd,
  _Peter_ and _Charters_ had been deify'd.
  But ev'ry Lord, each gen'rous Friend implore,
  And by Subscriptions meanly swell thy Store.
  When to the Town by sordid Int'rest led,
  Mump for a Dinner, flatter for a Bed.
  Then to thy Grot retire, indulge thy Spite,
  And rail at those who for Subsistence write.
  Summon thy Rags, invoke thy scurril Muse,
  With keenest Malice _Addison_ abuse.
  Sculking, the Scandal privately disperse,
  (a) Then own in Prose the Baseness of thy Verse.

    [Footnote a: He writ a vile Lampoon on Mr. _Addison_, and then in
    a Preface owns, he deserves Respect from every Lover of Learning.]

    So e're _Arachne_ to her Cell repairs,
  Insidiously she weaves her glewy Snares.
  Sullen, she meditates on Deaths to come,
  And meliorates the Poison in her Womb.
  (b) Should hapless _Clarion_ thither take his Flight,
  He falls her Prey, mindful of ancient Spite.

    [Footnote b: _Vide_ _Spencer_'s Fate of the Butterfly.]

    With Malice swoll'n, Pride, Envy, Avarice,
  Ingratitude attends this Train to Vice.
  Yet one remains untold; with Lust endu'd,
  Behold the Fribler lab'ring to be lewd.
  Kind _Cibber_ interpos'd, forbad the Banns,
  He'd peopled else this Isle with _Calibans_.

    (a) The noble _Timon_, in thy waspish Strains,
  A Proof of thy Ingratitude remains.
  Courteous to all, munificent, humane,
  Subject of others Praise, to thee of Pain.
  Exalted far above thy groveling State,
  The Object of his Pity, not his Hate.
  He smiles at Scandal so unjustly thrown,
  And at thy Malice he disdains to frown.

    [Footnote a: _Vide_ a Poem on Taste.]

    Thus oft we see a currish, Mungrel Crew,
  A stately Mastiff eagerly pursue.
  They swarm around, they yelp, they snarl, they grin,
  Bold in Appearance, timerous within:
  With such mean Foes he deigns not to engage,
  But lifts his Leg, and pisses out their Rage.

    How dar'st thou, Peasant, give thy Pen this Loose?
  Becomes it thee thus madly to traduce?
  The Great, the Low, the Virtuous, and the Base,
  Alike are grown thy Subject of Disgrace.
  Safe in thy Weakness, thou defi'st a Foe;
  E'en (b) _Cibber_'s Cudgel scorn'd to stoop so low.
  The Mercy of the Law restrains thy Fears;
  _Coventry_'s Act secures thy Nose and Ears.
  Yet there remains, to fill thy Soul with Care,
  A Blanket to curvet thee in the Air.

    [Footnote b: _Vide_ _Cibber_'s Letter to _Pope_.]

    O wretched Life consum'd in restless Pains,
  Where Dread of Punishment incessant reigns!
  Poor Self-Tormentor! in whose gloomy Breast
  The Vulture dwells, inhospitable Guest.
  Be to my Foe no greater Curse assign'd!
  Than a malignant Heart and envious Mind.

    Thrice happy he! that's with Good Nature blest,
  Love of his Species rules his tender Breast;
  Nor there confin'd: The Brute Creation share
  His kind Beneficence and gen'rous Care.
  No base malicious Thoughts his Peace annoy:
  Are others happy? he partakes their Joy.
  Chearful and innocent the Day he spends,
  And Silver Sleep his quiet Nights attends.

    But thou, a Stranger to this Peace of Mind,
  Search where thou may'st conspicuous Merit find:
  There strive to blacken with thy utmost Art,
  And rail the more, the greater the Desert.

    Is there a Man, an Honour to the Age,
  Unsully'd by the keenest Party-rage;
  By Vice untainted; who, from early Youth,
  Firmly adher'd to Honour, Justice, Truth;
  Whom no unruly Passions e're cou'd blind,
  Nor ruffle his Serenity of Mind;
  His Country's Good, the Patriot's noblest View,
  Unbrib'd, unaw'd, does stedfastly pursue;
  Polite in Manners, and rever'd his Sense,
  And long in Senates fam'd for Eloquence;
  But if to these Endowments of the Mind,
  A graceful Figure happily is join'd,
  Then flows thy Gall, then raves thy half-form'd Clay,
  Then frets thy putrid Carcass to Decay.

    So when the croaking Toad the Ox beheld,
  His envious Heart with Indignation swell'd.
  Vainly the Reptil thought he could extend
  His bloated Form, and Nature's Error mend.
  He drew his Breath; he swell'd--he burst; he dy'd
  A Victim to his Arrogance and Pride.

75 per cent.
