PREFACE

  By W. Y. EVANS-WENTZ, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc.
  Jesus College, Oxford; Author of
  THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD,
  TIBET'S GREAT YOGI MILAREPA,
  TIBETAN YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES, etc.

The value of Yogananda's AUTOBIOGRAPHYis greatly enhanced by the
fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men
of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner,
but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book ABOUT
yogis BY a yogi.  As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary
lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance
both timely and timeless.  To its illustrious author, whom I have
had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every
reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document
is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu
mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be
published in the West.

It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose
life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of
the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my TIBETAN
YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES. {FN1-1} It was at Puri, in Orissa, on
the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the
head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly
occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples.
He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the
United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and
questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those
in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom
he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to
the West.

Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence,
and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously
accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own
community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall
his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored
garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the
entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long
and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly
firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had
chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither
multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of
India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath,
"Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his
mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of
being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried
to a triumphant completion.  I am glad, indeed, to be able to record
this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar.
Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly
and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda,
his disciple, has now described for the ages.  W. Y. EVANS-WENTZ

CHAPTER: 1

MY PARENTS AND EARLY LIFE

The characteristic features of Indian culture have long been
a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant disciple-guru
{FN1-2} relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage whose
beautiful life was chiseled for the ages. He was one of the great
masters who are India's sole remaining wealth. Emerging in every
generation, they have bulwarked their land against the fate of
Babylon and Egypt.

I find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of
a previous incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant
life, a yogi {FN1-3} amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of
the past, by some dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse
of the future.

The helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind.
I was resentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express
myself freely. Prayerful surges arose within me as I realized
my bodily impotence. My strong emotional life took silent form as
words in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues,
my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali
syllables of my people.  The beguiling scope of an infant's mind!
adultly considered limited to toys and toes.

Psychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many
obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment
at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother's
caresses, and my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling
step.  These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are yet a
natural basis of self-confidence.

My far-reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known
to have retained their self-consciousness without interruption by
the dramatic transition to and from "life" and "death." If man be
solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity.
But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, man is
essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of human
egoity is only temporarily allied with sense perception.

Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During
travels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections
from the lips of veracious men and women.

I was born in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed
my first eight years at Gorakhpur. This was my birthplace in the
United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four
boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh {FN1-4}, was the second
son and the fourth child.

Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the KSHATRIYA caste. {FN1-5} Both
were blessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and
dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental
harmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young
lives.

Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern.
Loving him dearly, we children yet observed a certain reverential
distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided
principally by his intellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts,
and taught us only through love. After her death, Father displayed
more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often
metamorphosed into my mother's.

In Mother's presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance
with the scriptures. Tales from the MAHABHARATA and RAMAYANA {FN1-6}
were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline.
Instruction and chastisement went hand in hand.

A daily gesture of respect to Father was given by Mother's dressing us
carefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office.
His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the
Bengal-Nagpur Railway, one of India's large companies. His work
involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during
my childhood.

Mother held an open hand toward the needy. Father was also kindly
disposed, but his respect for law and order extended to the budget.
One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's
monthly income.

"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable
limit." Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother.
She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any
disagreement.

"Good-by; I am going away to my mother's home." Ancient ultimatum!

We broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived
opportunely; he whispered to Father some sage counsel, garnered
no doubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory
remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble
I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic
discussion.

"Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived
at the house." Mother's smile had its own persuasion.

"Why ten rupees? One is enough." Father added a justification: "When
my father and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of
poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was
a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that
I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per month. He
declined, remarking that even a rupee is important."

"How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!" Mother's heart
had an instant logic. "Do you want this woman also to remember
painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?"

"You win!" With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he
opened his wallet. "Here is a ten-rupee note. Give it to her with
my good will."

Father tended to first say "No" to any new proposal. His attitude
toward the strange woman who so readily enlisted Mother's sympathy
was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant
acceptance--typical of the French mind in the West-is really only
honoring the principle of "due reflection." I always found Father
reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I could bolster
up my numerous requests with one or two good arguments, he invariably
put the coveted goal within my reach, whether it were a vacation
trip or a new motorcycle.

Father was a strict disciplinarian to his children in their early
years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Spartan. He
never visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation
in various spiritual practices and in reading the BHAGAVAD GITA.
{FN1-7} Shunning all luxuries, he would cling to one old pair of
shoes until they were useless. His sons bought automobiles after
they came into popular use, but Father was always content with the
trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of
money for the sake of power was alien to his nature. Once, after
organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself
by holding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a
civic duty in his spare time.

Several years after Father had retired on a pension, an English
accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway
Company. The amazed investigator discovered that Father had never
applied for overdue bonuses.

"He did the work of three men!" the accountant told the company.
"He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.) owing to him as back
compensation." The officials presented Father with a check for
this amount. He thought so little about it that he overlooked any
mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest
brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement.

"Why be elated by material profit?" Father replied. "The one who
pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain
nor depressed by loss. He knows that man arrives penniless in this
world, and departs without a single rupee."

[Illustration: MY FATHER, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, A Disciple of
Lahiri Mahasaya--see father1.jpg]

Early in their married life, my parents became disciples of a
great master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This contact strengthened
Father's naturally ascetical temperament. Mother made a remarkable
admission to my eldest sister Roma: "Your father and myself live
together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having
children."

Father first met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, {FN1-8}
an employee in the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.
Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian
saints.  He invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior
glories of his own guru.

"Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which
your father became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?"

It was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat together
in the compound of my home, that he put this intriguing question.
I shook my head with a smile of anticipation.

"Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your
father-to give me a week's leave from my Gorakhpur duties in order
to visit my guru in Benares. Your father ridiculed my plan.

"'Are you going to become a religious fanatic?' he inquired.
'Concentrate on your office work if you want to forge ahead.'

"Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your
father in a palanquin. He dismissed his servants and conveyance,
and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed
out the advantages of striving for worldly success. But I heard
him listlessly. My heart was repeating: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot
live without seeing you!'

"Our path took us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays
of the late afternoon sun were still crowning the tall ripple of
the wild grass. We paused in admiration. There in the field, only
a few yards from us, the form of my great guru suddenly appeared!
{FN1-9}

"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was
resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished as mysteriously as he
had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri
Mahasaya!' Your father was motionless with stupefaction for a few
moments.

"'Abinash, not only do I give YOU leave, but I give MYSELF leave to
start for Benares tomorrow. I must know this great Lahiri Mahasaya,
who is able to materialize himself at will in order to intercede
for you! I will take my wife and ask this master to initiate us in
his spiritual path. Will you guide us to him?'

"'Of course.' Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer,
and the quick, favorable turn of events.

"The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We
took a horse cart the following day, and then had to walk through
narrow lanes to my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor,
we bowed before the master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture.
He blinked his piercing eyes and leveled them on your father.

"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His words were the
same as those he had used two days before in the Gorakhpur field.
He added, 'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me,
and that you and your wife have accompanied him.'

"To their joy, he initiated your parents in the spiritual practice
of KRIYA YOGA. {FN1-10} Your father and I, as brother disciples,
have been close friends since the memorable day of the vision.
Lahiri Mahasaya took a definite interest in your own birth. Your
life shall surely be linked with his own: the master's blessing
never fails."

Lahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly after I had entered it.
His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in
the various cities to which Father was transferred by his office.
Many a morning and evening found Mother and me meditating before an
improvised shrine, offering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood
paste. With frankincense and myrrh as well as our united devotions,
we honored the divinity which had found full expression in Lahiri
Mahasaya.

His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew,
the thought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often
see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking
a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet
of his luminous body, it would change and again become the picture.
As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed
in my mind from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living,
enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of
trial or confusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At
first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I
began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He
had often written to those of his disciples who were over-anxious
to see him: "Why come to view my bones and flesh, when I am ever
within range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?"

I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing
through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This experience gave
intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur,
Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired
of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically
motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above
my head.

"Bow to him mentally!" She knew I was too feeble even to lift my
hands in salutation. "If you really show your devotion and inwardly
kneel before him, your life will be spared!"

I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping
my body and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable
symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to
bend over and touch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable
faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the
little picture.

"O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my
son!"

I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through
which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.

One of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given
to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration.
The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's
brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy.

It appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed.
Over his protest, a group picture was once taken of him and
a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed
photographer who discovered that the plate which had clear images
of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in
the center where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines
of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed.

A certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted
that the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning,
as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen
behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every
precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each
one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but
once again the master's form was missing.

With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his
guru.  It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence
with a pregnant comment:

"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?"

"I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of
the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit
appears fully to dwell."

"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you."

Again the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred
figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on
the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least,
I have seen none.

The photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair
features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he
belonged. His intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in
a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal
direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely
oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at
all times to the spiritual problems of seekers who approached for
his bounty.

Shortly after my healing through the potency of the guru's picture,
I had an influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning,
I fell into a deep reverie.

"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?" This probing thought
came powerfully into my mind. An immense flash of light at once
manifested to my inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in
meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema
pictures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead.

"Who are you?" I spoke aloud.

"We are the Himalayan yogis." The celestial response is difficult
to describe; my heart was thrilled.

"Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!" The vision
vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles
to infinity.

"What is this wondrous glow?"

"I am Iswara.{FN1-11} I am Light." The voice was as murmuring
clouds.

"I want to be one with Thee!"

Out of the slow dwindling of my divine ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent
legacy of inspiration to seek God. "He is eternal, ever-new Joy!"
This memory persisted long after the day of rapture.

Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for
I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated
in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound.
She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare
my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma
complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I
smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.

"Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?"

"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing
your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear."

"You little liar!"

"Sis, don't call me a liar until you see what happens in the
morning." Indignation filled me.

Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant
resolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply.

"By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have
a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm; and YOUR boil
shall swell to twice its present size!"

Morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the
dimensions of Uma's boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister
rushed to Mother. "Mukunda has become a necromancer!" Gravely,
Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing
harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it.

My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by
the doctor's incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a
constant reminder of the power in man's sheer word.

Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken
with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to
explode like bombs and produce definite, though injurious, effects.
I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory power in speech
could be wisely directed to free one's life from difficulties, and
thus operate without scar or rebuke. The Mr.

Yang Yu who performed the ceremony is the Minister whom the See Yups
came on from San Francisco to visit.

It does not seem as if he were going to be of much use to them, for
instead of returning to China he is to go to St. Petersburg, and
he may not see his Emperor for a very long time.

An amusing story comes from Victoria, British Columbia, about the
Chinese special envoy, who has just arrived in New York on his way
to London.

When the Canadian Pacific steamer which brought him over from China
arrived in port, it was found that she had two cases of smallpox
on board.

The authorities of Victoria at once ordered her to quarantine for
twenty-four days.

The steerage passengers, who were all Chinamen, were taken to the
quarantine station, where the usual process of fumigation and
disinfection took place.

There were, doubtless, many protests and wails from the unfortunate
Celestials, but nobody heeded them, and the work was carried through
without difficulty.

When, however, it came to the other passengers, there was a great
disturbance. The English were furious, threatening terrible
things if any one attempted to fumigate them. A special company
of 200 armed men was consequently detailed to guard the quarantine
station, lest the passengers should attempt to get away before the
twenty-four days were over.

All this trouble was as nothing, however, to that which arose when
it was conveyed to His Excellency Chang, Special Envoy from the
Emperor of China to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, that he
needed disinfecting!

Accompanying the Envoy was his suite, which was composed of a number
of Chinamen of high rank. None of these illustrious persons had
the slightest knowledge of Western ways, and they one and all
protested that to fumigate them, or their great Chang, was practically
fumigating the Emperor of China!

In their eyes this seemed the most awful crime that mortal could
commit.

His Excellency Chang refused to submit to any such insulting
treatment, and appealed to the Canadian Government, the British
Government, and the Chinese Ministers in London to protect him.

He declared that, rather than submit, he would go back to China
without fulfilling his mission,--a proceeding fraught with
considerable danger to himself, as he stated that the Emperor, his
master, might cut off his head, and the heads of all his suite, for
disobedience to his wishes.

But the noble Envoy preferred death to fumigation.

What he imagined fumigation was it is impossible to say, but he
warned the authorities that if they attempted it, the Emperor of
China would declare war on England.

The unfortunate officials did not know what to do, and waited in a
great state of anxiety for orders from the Government.

The story does not say how the matter was arranged, but as His
Excellency is now in New York, and war has not been declared by
China, it is to be supposed that he was not fumigated.

A generation ago the inhabitants of Japan were not allowed to leave
their country, nor were foreigners permitted to enter it.

Any word spoken with clear realization and deep concentration
has a materializing value. Loud or silent repetition of inspiring
words has been found effective in Coueism and similar systems of
psychotherapy; the secret lies in the stepping-up of the mind's
vibratory rate. The poet Tennyson has left us, in his MEMOIRS, an
account of his repetitious device for passing beyond the conscious
mind into superconsciousness:

"A kind of waking trance-this for lack of a better word-I have
frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone,"
Tennyson wrote. "This has come upon me through REPEATING my own
name to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the
intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself
seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this not
a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the surest, utterly
beyond words-where death was an almost laughable impossibility-the
loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction, but the
only true life." He wrote further: "It is no nebulous ecstasy, but
a state of transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness
of mind."

{FN1-13} Kali is a symbol of God in the aspect of eternal Mother
Nature.


CHAPTER: 2

MY MOTHER'S DEATH AND THE MYSTIC AMULET

My mother's greatest desire was the marriage of my elder brother.
"Ah, when I behold the face of Ananta's wife, I shall find heaven
on this earth!" I frequently heard Mother express in these words
her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity.

I was about eleven years old at the time of Ananta's betrothal.
Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the wedding preparations.
Father and I alone remained at our home in Bareilly in northern
India, whence Father had been transferred after two years at Lahore.

I had previously witnessed the splendor of nuptial rites for my
two elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the eldest son,
plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relatives,
daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them
comfortably in a large, newly acquired house at 50 Amherst Street.
Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne
on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be,
the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and
camels, the English, Scottish and Indian orchestras, the professional
entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals.

Father and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family
in time for the ceremony. Shortly before the great day, however,
I had an ominous vision.

It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the
piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of
the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and
I saw the beloved form of my mother.

"Awaken your father!" Her voice was only a whisper. "Take the first
available train, at four o'clock this morning. Rush to Calcutta if
you would see me!" The wraithlike figure vanished.

"Father, Father! Mother is dying!" The terror in my tone aroused
him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.

"Never mind that hallucination of yours." Father gave his characteristic
negation to a new situation. "Your mother is in excellent health.
If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow."

"You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!" Anguish
caused me to add bitterly, "Nor shall I ever forgive you!"

The melancholy morning came with explicit words: "Mother dangerously
ill; marriage postponed; come at once."

Father and I left distractedly. One of my uncles met us en route
at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with
telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination
arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I
felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to
the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing
black eyes had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of
childhood.

"Does she yet live?" I stopped for one last question to my uncle.

"Of course she is alive!" He was not slow to interpret the desperation
in my face. But I scarcely believed him.

When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the
stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless
state.  Years passed before any reconciliation entered my heart.
Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the
Divine Mother. Her words brought final healing to my suppurating
wounds:

"It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the
tenderness of many mothers! See in My gaze the two black eyes, the
lost beautiful eyes, thou seekest!"

Father and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory
rites for the well-beloved. Early every morning I made a pathetic
memorial--pilgrimage to a large SHEOLI tree which shaded the
smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments,
I thought that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing themselves
with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with
the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly light emerging
from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for God assailed me. I felt
powerfully drawn to the Himalayas.

One of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the holy hills,
visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the
high mountain abode of yogis and swamis. {FN2-1}

"Let us run away to the Himalayas." My suggestion one day to
Dwarka Prasad, the young son of our landlord in Bareilly, fell on
unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who
had just arrived to see Father. Instead of laughing lightly over
this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite
point to ridicule me.

"Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami without that!"

But I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They brought a clear
picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they
awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with
what natural ease I would wear the garb of that anciently-founded
monastic order.

Chatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a love for God descending
with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to
the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.

I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills.
Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to
Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one
at dawn to the SHEOLI tree. My heart wept for the lost Mothers,
human and divine.

The rent left in the family fabric by Mother's death was irreparable.
Father never remarried during his nearly forty remaining years.
Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock,
he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness
and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office
hours he retired like a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing
KRIYA YOGA in a sweet serenity. Long after Mother's death, I attempted
to engage an English nurse to attend to details that would make my
parent's life more comfortable. But Father shook his head.

[Illustration: My Mother, A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see
mother.jpg]

"Service to me ended with your mother." His eyes were remote with
a lifelong devotion. "I will not accept ministrations from any
other woman."

Fourteen months after Mother's passing, I learned that she had left
me a momentous message. Ananta was present at her deathbed and had
recorded her words. Although she had asked that the disclosure be
made to me in one year, my brother delayed. He was soon to leave
Bareilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother had chosen for him.
{FN2-2} One evening he summoned me to his side.

"Mukunda, I have been reluctant to give you strange tidings."
Ananta's tone held a note of resignation. "My fear was to inflame
your desire to leave home. But in any case you are bristling with
divine ardor.  When I captured you recently on your way to the
Himalayas, I came to a definite resolve. I must not further postpone
the fulfillment of my solemn promise." My brother handed me a small
box, and delivered Mother's message.

"Let these words be my final blessing, my beloved son Mukunda!"
Mother had said. "The hour is here when I must relate a number of
phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your destined
path when you were but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to
the home of my guru in Benares. Almost hidden behind a throng of
disciples, I could barely see Lahiri Mahasaya as he sat in deep
meditation.

"While I patted you, I was praying that the great guru take
notice and bestow a blessing. As my silent devotional demand grew
in intensity, he opened his eyes and beckoned me to approach. The
others made a way for me; I bowed at the sacred feet. My master
seated you on his lap, placing his hand on your forehead by way of
spiritually baptizing you.

"'Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he
will carry many souls to God's kingdom.'

"My heart leaped with joy to find my secret prayer granted by the
omniscient guru. Shortly before your birth, he had told me you
would follow his path.

"Later, my son, your vision of the Great Light was known to me and
your sister Roma, as from the next room we observed you motionless
on the bed. Your little face was illuminated; your voice rang with
iron resolve as you spoke of going to the Himalayas in quest of
the Divine.

"In these ways, dear son, I came to know that your road lies far
from worldly ambitions. The most singular event in my life brought
further confirmation-an event which now impels my deathbed message.

"It was an interview with a sage in the Punjab. While our family
was living in Lahore, one morning the servant came precipitantly
into my room.

"'Mistress, a strange SADHU {FN2-3} is here. He insists that he
"see the mother of Mukunda."'

"These simple words struck a profound chord within me; I went at
once to greet the visitor. Bowing at his feet, I sensed that before
me was a true man of God.

"'Mother,' he said, 'the great masters wish you to know that your
stay on earth will not be long. Your next illness shall prove to
be your last.' {FN2-4} There was a silence, during which I felt no
alarm but only a vibration of great peace. Finally he addressed me
again:

"'You are to be the custodian of a certain silver amulet. I will
not give it to you today; to demonstrate the truth in my words, the
talisman shall materialize in your hands tomorrow as you meditate.
On your deathbed, you must instruct your eldest son Ananta to keep
the amulet for one year and then to hand it over to your second
son.  Mukunda will understand the meaning of the talisman from the
great ones. He should receive it about the time he is ready to
renounce all worldly hopes and start his vital search for God. When
he has retained the amulet for some years, and when it has served
its purpose, it shall vanish. Even if kept in the most secret spot,
it shall return whence it came.'

"I proffered alms {FN2-5} to the saint, and bowed before him
in great reverence. Not taking the offering, he departed with a
blessing. The next evening, as I sat with folded hands in meditation,
a silver amulet materialized between my palms, even as the SADHU
had promised.  It made itself known by a cold, smooth touch. I
have jealously guarded it for more than two years, and now leave
it in Ananta's keeping. Do not grieve for me, as I shall have been
ushered by my great guru into the arms of the Infinite. Farewell,
my child; the Cosmic Mother will protect you."

A blaze of illumination came over me with possession of the amulet;
many dormant memories awakened. The talisman, round and anciently
quaint, was covered with Sanskrit characters. I understood that it
came from teachers of past lives, who were invisibly guiding my
steps.  A further significance there was, indeed; but one does not
reveal fully the heart of an amulet.

How the talisman finally vanished amidst deeply unhappy circumstances
of my life; and how its loss was a herald of my gain of a guru,
cannot be told in this chapter.

But the small boy, thwarted in his attempts to reach the Himalayas,
daily traveled far on the wings of his amulet.

{FN2-1} Sanskrit root meaning of SWAMI is "he who is one with his
Self (SWA)." Applied to a member of the Indian order of monks, the
title has the formal respect of "the reverend."

{FN2-2} The Indian custom, whereby parents choose the life-partner
for their child, has resisted the blunt assaults of time. The
percentage is high of happy Indian marriages.

{FN2-3} An anchorite; one who pursues a SADHANA or path of spiritual
discipline.

{FN2-4} When I discovered by these words that Mother had possessed
secret knowledge of a short life, I understood for the first time
why she had been insistent on hastening the plans for Ananta's
marriage.  Though she died before the wedding, her natural maternal
wish had been to witness the rites.

{FN2-5} A customary gesture of respect to SADHUS.


CHAPTER: 3

THE SAINT WITH TWO BODIES

"Father, if I promise to return home without coercion, may I take
a sight-seeing trip to Benares?"

My keen love of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted
me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots.
Usually one or more of my friends accompanied me; we would travel
comfortably on first-class passes provided by Father. His position
as a railroad official was fully satisfactory to the nomads in the
family.

Father promised to give my request due consideration. The next
day he summoned me and held out a round-trip pass from Bareilly to
Benares, a number of rupee notes, and two letters.

"I have a business matter to propose to a Benares friend, Kedar
Nath Babu. Unfortunately I have lost his address. But I believe you
will be able to get this letter to him through our common friend,
Swami Pranabananda. The swami, my brother disciple, has attained
an exalted spiritual stature. You will benefit by his company; this
second note will serve as your introduction."


Father's eyes twinkled as he added, "Mind, no more flights from
home!"

I set forth with the zest of my twelve years (though time has
never dimmed my delight in new scenes and strange faces). Reaching
Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swami's residence. The
front door was open; I made my way to a long, hall-like room on
the second floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was
seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His head and
unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about
his lips. To dispel my thought that I had intruded, he greeted me
as an old friend.

"BABA ANAND (bliss to my dear one)." His welcome was given heartily
in a childlike voice. I knelt and touched his feet.

"Are you Swami Pranabananda?"

He nodded. "Are you Bhagabati's son?" His words were out before I
had had time to get Father's letter from my pocket. In astonishment,
I handed him the note of introduction, which now seemed superfluous.

"Of course I will locate Kedar Nath Babu for you." The saint again
surprised me by his clairvoyance. He glanced at the letter, and
made a few affectionate references to my parent.

"You know, I am enjoying two pensions. One is by the recommendation
of your father, for whom I once worked in the railroad office. The
other is by the recommendation of my Heavenly Father, for whom I
have conscientiously finished my earthly duties in life."

I found this remark very obscure. "What kind of pension, sir, do
you receive from the Heavenly Father? Does He drop money in your
lap?"

He laughed. "I mean a pension of fathomless peace-a reward for many
years of deep meditation. I never crave money now. My few material
needs are amply provided for. Later you will understand the
significance of a second pension."

Abruptly terminating our conversation, the saint became gravely
motionless. A sphinxlike air enveloped him. At first his eyes
sparkled, as if observing something of interest, then grew dull. I
felt abashed at his pauciloquy; he had not yet told me how I could
meet Father's friend. A trifle restlessly, I looked about me in
the bare room, empty except for us two. My idle gaze took in his
wooden sandals, lying under the platform seat.

"Little sir, {FN3-1} don't get worried. The man you wish to see
will be with you in half an hour." The yogi was reading my mind-a
feat not too difficult at the moment!

Again he fell into inscrutable silence. My watch informed me that
thirty minutes had elapsed.

The swami aroused himself. "I think Kedar Nath Babu is nearing the
door."

I heard somebody coming up the stairs. An amazed incomprehension
arose suddenly; my thoughts raced in confusion: "How is it possible
that Father's friend has been summoned to this place without the
help of a messenger? The swami has spoken to no one but myself
since my arrival!"

Abruptly I quitted the room and descended the steps. Halfway down
I met a thin, fair-skinned man of medium height. He appeared to be
in a hurry.

"Are you Kedar Nath Babu?" Excitement colored my voice.

"Yes. Are you not Bhagabati's son who has been waiting here to meet
me?" He smiled in friendly fashion.

"Sir, how do you happen to come here?" I felt baffled resentment
over his inexplicable presence.

"Everything is mysterious today! Less than an hour ago I had just
finished my bath in the Ganges when Swami Pranabananda approached
me.  I have no idea how he knew I was there at that time.

"'Bhagabati's son is waiting for you in my apartment,' he said.
'Will you come with me?' I gladly agreed. As we proceeded hand in
hand, the swami in his wooden sandals was strangely able to outpace
me, though I wore these stout walking shoes.

"'How long will it take you to reach my place?' Pranabanandaji
suddenly halted to ask me this question.

"'About half an hour.'

"'I have something else to do at present.' He gave me an enigmatical
glance. 'I must leave you behind. You can join me in my house,
where Bhagabati's son and I will be awaiting you.'

"Before I could remonstrate, he dashed swiftly past me and disappeared
in the crowd. I walked here as fast as possible."

This explanation only increased my bewilderment. I inquired how
long he had known the swami.

"We met a few times last year, but not recently. I was very glad
to see him again today at the bathing GHAT."

"I cannot believe my ears! Am I losing my mind? Did you meet him
in a vision, or did you actually see him, touch his hand, and hear
the sound of his feet?"

"I don't know what you're driving at!" He flushed angrily. "I am
not lying to you. Can't you understand that only through the swami
could I have known you were waiting at this place for me?"

"Why, that man, Swami Pranabananda, has not left my sight a moment
since I first came about an hour ago." I blurted out the whole
story.

His eyes opened widely. "Are we living in this material age, or
are we dreaming? I never expected to witness such a miracle in my
life! I thought this swami was just an ordinary man, and now I find
he can materialize an extra body and work through it!" Together we
entered the saint's room.

"Look, those are the very sandals he was wearing at the GHAT,"
Kedar Nath Babu whispered. "He was clad only in a loincloth, just
as I see him now."

As the visitor bowed before him, the saint turned to me with a
quizzical smile.

"Why are you stupefied at all this? The subtle unity of the phenomenal
world is not hidden from true yogis. I instantly see and converse
with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They can similarly transcend
at will every obstacle of gross matter."

It was probably in an effort to stir spiritual ardor in my young
breast that the swami had condescended to tell me of his powers of
astral radio and television. {FN3-2} But instead of enthusiasm, I
experienced only an awe-stricken fear. Inasmuch as I was destined
to undertake my divine search through one particular guru-Sri
Yukteswar, whom I had not yet met-I felt no inclination to accept
Pranabananda as my teacher. I glanced at him doubtfully, wondering
if it were he or his counterpart before me.

[Illustration: Swami Pranabananda, "The Saint With Two Bodies", An
Exalted Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see pranabananda.jpg]

The master sought to banish my disquietude by bestowing a soul-awakening
gaze, and by some inspiring words about his guru.

"Lahiri Mahasaya was the greatest yogi I ever knew. He was Divinity
Itself in the form of flesh."

If a disciple, I reflected, could materialize an extra fleshly form
at will, what miracles indeed could be barred to his master?

"I will tell you how priceless is a guru's help. I used to meditate
with another disciple for eight hours every night. We had to work at
the railroad office during the day. Finding difficulty in carrying
on my clerical duties, I desired to devote my whole time to God.
For eight years I persevered, meditating half the night. I had
wonderful results; tremendous spiritual perceptions illumined my
mind. But a little veil always remained between me and the Infinite.
Even with super-human earnestness, I found the final irrevocable
union to be denied me. One evening I paid a visit to Lahiri Mahasaya
and pleaded for his divine intercession. My importunities continued
during the entire night.

"'Angelic Guru, my spiritual anguish is such that I can no longer
bear my life without meeting the Great Beloved face to face!'

"'What can I do? You must meditate more profoundly.'

"'I am appealing to Thee, O God my Master! I see Thee materialized
before me in a physical body; bless me that I may perceive Thee in
Thine infinite form!'

"Lahiri Mahasaya extended his hand in a benign gesture. 'You may
go now and meditate. I have interceded for you with Brahma.' {FN3-3}

"Immeasurably uplifted, I returned to my home. In meditation that
night, the burning Goal of my life was achieved. Now I ceaselessly
enjoy the spiritual pension. Never from that day has the Blissful
Creator remained hidden from my eyes behind any screen of delusion."

Pranabananda's face was suffused with divine light. The peace of
another world entered my heart; all fear had fled. The saint made
a further confidence.

"Some months later I returned to Lahiri Mahasaya and tried to
thank him for his bestowal of the infinite gift. Then I mentioned
another matter.

"'Divine Guru, I can no longer work in the office. Please release
me.  Brahma keeps me continuously intoxicated.'

"'Apply for a pension from your company.'

"'What reason shall I give, so early in my service?'

"'Say what you feel.'

"The next day I made my application. The doctor inquired the grounds
for my premature request.

"'At work, I find an overpowering sensation rising in my spine.
{FN3-4} It permeates my whole body, unfitting me for the performance
of my duties.'

"Without further questioning the physician recommended me highly
for a pension, which I soon received. I know the divine will of
Lahiri Mahasaya worked through the doctor and the railroad officials,
including your father. Automatically they obeyed the great guru's
spiritual direction, and freed me for a life of unbroken communion
with the Beloved." {FN3-5}

After this extraordinary revelation, Swami Pranabananda retired
into one of his long silences. As I was taking leave, touching his
feet reverently, he gave me his blessing:

"Your life belongs to the path of renunciation and yoga. I shall
see you again, with your father, later on." The years brought
fulfillment to both these predictions. {FN3-6}

Kedar Nath Babu walked by my side in the gathering darkness. I
delivered Father's letter, which my companion read under a street
lamp.

"Your father suggests that I take a position in the Calcutta office
of his railroad company. How pleasant to look forward to at least
one of the pensions that Swami Pranabananda enjoys! But it is
impossible; I cannot leave Benares. Alas, two bodies are not yet
for me!"

{FN3-1} CHOTO MAHASAYA is the term by which a number of Indian
saints addressed me. It translates "little sir.".

{FN3-2} In its own way, physical science is affirming the validity
of laws discovered by yogis through mental science. For example,
a demonstration that man has televisional powers was given on Nov.
26, 1934 at the Royal University of Rome. "Dr. Giuseppe Calligaris,
professor of neuro-psychology, pressed certain points of a subject's
body and the subject responded with minute descriptions of other
persons and objects on the opposite side of a wall. Dr. Calligaris
told the other professors that if certain areas on the skin are
agitated, the subject is given super-sensorial impressions enabling
him to see objects that he could not otherwise perceive. To enable
his subject to discern things on the other side of a wall, Professor
Calligaris pressed on a spot to the right of the thorax for fifteen
minutes. Dr. Calligaris said that if other spots of the body were
agitated, the subjects could see objects at any distance, regardless
of whether they had ever before seen those objects.".

{FN3-3} God in His aspect of Creator; from Sanskrit root BRIH, to
expand. When Emerson's poem BRAHMA appeared in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY
in 1857, most the readers were bewildered. Emerson chuckled. "Tell
them," he said, "to say 'Jehovah' instead of 'Brahma' and they will
not feel any perplexity."

{FN3-4} In deep meditation, the first experience of Spirit is on the
altar of the spine, and then in the brain. The torrential bliss is
overwhelming, but the yogi learns to control its outward manifestations.

{FN3-5} After his retirement, Pranabananda wrote one of the most
profound commentaries on the BHAGAVAD GITA, available in Bengali
and Hindi.

{FN3-6} See chapter 27.


CHAPTER: 4

MY INTERRUPTED FLIGHT TOWARD THE HIMALAYAS

"Leave your classroom on some trifling pretext, and engage a hackney
carriage. Stop in the lane where no one in my house can see you."

These were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school
friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalayas. We had chosen
the following day for our flight. Precautions were necessary,
as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the
plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The
amulet, like a spiritual yeast, was silently at work within me.
Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to find the master whose face
often appeared to me in visions.

The family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been
permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom,
Ananta had brought his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar
Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations
and prepared my mind for the divine search.

The memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the
wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a
blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of
the BHAGAVAD GITA, a string of prayer beads, and two loincloths.
This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the
steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.

"What is the excitement?" His gaze roved suspiciously over my
person.

I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving
my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to
Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving
our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever
brother could easily play the part of a detective, we thought to
outwit him by European garb.

On the way to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh,
whom I called Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing for a guru
in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness.
Well-camouflaged, we hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts.

"All we need now are canvas shoes." I led my companions to a shop
displaying rubber-soled footwear. "Articles of leather, gotten
only through the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this holy
trip." I halted on the street to remove the leather cover from my
BHAGAVAD GITA, and the leather straps from my English-made SOLA
TOPEE (helmet).

At the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to
transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the
train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of
my glorious anticipations.

"Just imagine!" I ejaculated. "We shall be initiated by the masters
and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will
be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas
will come tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek house
cats awaiting our caresses!"

This remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both
metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from
Amar.  But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window
at the scampering landscape.

"Let the money be divided in three portions." Jatinda broke a long
silence with this suggestion. "Each of us should buy his own ticket
at Burdwan. Thus no one at the station will surmise that we are
running away together."

I unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan.
Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the platform.
We waited fifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching
in all directions, we shouted Jatinda's name with the urgency
of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the
little station.

I was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That God
would countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion
of my first carefully-planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.

"Amar, we must return home." I was weeping like a child. "Jatinda's
callous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure."

"Is this your love for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test
of a treacherous companion?"

Through Amar's suggestion of a divine test, my heart steadied
itself.  We refreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats,
SITABHOG (food for the goddess) and MOTICHUR (nuggets of sweet
pearl). In a few hours, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly.
Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we discussed a vital matter as we
waited on the platform.

"Amar, we may soon be closely questioned by railroad officials.
I am not underrating my brother's ingenuity! No matter what the
outcome, I will not speak untruth."

"All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still. Don't laugh or grin
while I am talking."

At this moment, a European station agent accosted me. He waved a
telegram whose import I immediately grasped.

"Are you running away from home in anger?"

"No!" I was glad his choice of words permitted me to make emphatic
reply. Not anger but "divinest melancholy" was responsible, I knew,
for my unconventional behavior.

The official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed
hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity.

"Where is the third boy?" The man injected a full ring of authority
into his voice. "Come on; speak the truth!"

"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you see that
we are only two?" Amar smiled impudently. "I am not a magician; I
can't conjure up a third companion."

The official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought
a new field of attack.

"What is your name?"

"I am called Thomas. I am the son of an English mother and a
converted Christian Indian father."

"What is your friend's name?"

"I call him Thompson."

By this time my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously
made for the train, whistling for departure. Amar followed with
the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into
a European compartment. It evidently pained him to think of two
half-English boys traveling in the section allotted to natives. After
his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably.
My friend wore an expression of blithe satisfaction at having
outwitted a veteran European official.

On the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother,
it went thus: "Three Bengali boys in English clothes running away
from home toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until
my arrival. Ample reward for your services."

"Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home." My
glance was reproachful. "Brother must have found one there."

My friend sheepishly acknowledged the thrust. We halted briefly
in Bareilly, where Dwarka Prasad awaited us with a telegram from
Ananta.  My old friend tried valiantly to detain us; I convinced him
that our flight had not been undertaken lightly. As on a previous
occasion, Dwarka refused my invitation to set forth to the Himalayas.

While our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep,
Amar was awakened by another questioning official. He, too, fell a
victim to the hybrid charms of "Thomas" and "Thompson." The train
bore us triumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic
mountains loomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the
station and entered the freedom of city crowds. Our first act was
to change into native costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated
our European disguise. A premonition of capture weighed on my mind.

Deeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to
proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil long hallowed by feet of many
masters. I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on
the platform. He was brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a
policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow
and took charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was
his duty to hold us until my elder brother arrived.

Learning that the truants' destination had been the Himalayas, the
officer related a strange story.

"I see you are crazy about saints! You will never meet a greater
man of God than the one I saw only yesterday. My brother officer
and I first encountered him five days ago. We were patrolling by the
Ganges, on a sharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions
were to capture him, alive or dead. He was known to be masquerading
as a SADHU in order to rob pilgrims. A short way before us, we
spied a figure which resembled the description of the criminal. He
ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower him. Approaching
his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the man's right
arm was severed almost completely from his body.

"Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger
astonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of
him, he spoke quietly.

"'I am not the murderer you are seeking.'

"I was deeply mortified to see I had injured the person of a
divine--looking sage. Prostrating myself at his feet, I implored
his pardon, and offered my turban-cloth to staunch the heavy spurts
of blood.

"'Son, that was just an understandable mistake on your part.' The
saint regarded me kindly. 'Run along, and don't reproach yourself.
The Beloved Mother is taking care of me.' He pushed his dangling
arm into its stump and lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased
to flow.

"'Come to me under yonder tree in three days and you will find me
fully healed. Thus you will feel no remorse.'

"Yesterday my brother officer and I went eagerly to the designated
spot. The SADHU was there and allowed us to examine his arm. It
bore no scar or trace of hurt!

"'I am going via Rishikesh to the Himalayan solitudes.' He blessed
us as he departed quickly. I feel that my life has been uplifted
through his sanctity."

The officer concluded with a pious ejaculation; his experience had
obviously moved him beyond his usual depths. With an impressive
gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In
the usual garbled manner of the sensational type of newspaper (not
missing, alas! even in India), the reporter's version was slightly
exaggerated: it indicated that the SADHU had been almost decapitated!

Amar and I lamented that we had missed the great yogi who could
forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike way. India, materially
poor for the last two centuries, yet has an inexhaustible fund of
divine wealth; spiritual "skyscrapers" may occasionally be encountered
by the wayside, even by worldly men like this policeman.

We thanked the officer for relieving our tedium with his marvelous
story. He was probably intimating that he was more fortunate than
we: he had met an illumined saint without effort; our earnest search
had ended, not at the feet of a master, but in a coarse police
station!

So near the Himalayas and yet, in our captivity, so far, I told
Amar I felt doubly impelled to seek freedom.

"Let us slip away when opportunity offers. We can go on foot to
holy Rishikesh." I smiled encouragingly.

But my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop
of our money had been taken from us.

"If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should
finish, not in the city of saints, but in the stomachs of tigers!"

Ananta and Amar's brother arrived after three days. Amar greeted
his relative with affectionate relief. I was unreconciled; Ananta
got no more from me than a severe upbraiding.

"I understand how you feel." My brother spoke soothingly. "All I
ask of you is to accompany me to Benares to meet a certain saint,
and go on to Calcutta to visit your grieving father for a few days.
Then you can resume your search here for a master."

Amar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention
of returning to Hardwar with me. He was enjoying the familial
warmth.  But I knew I would never abandon the quest for my guru.

Our party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant
response to my prayers.

A clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me
at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to ask a certain scriptural
authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his son had
promised to undertake my dissuasion from the path of a SANNYASI.
{FN4-1}

Ananta took me to their home. The son, a young man of ebullient
manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He engaged me in a lengthy
philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant knowledge
of my future, he discountenanced my idea of being a monk.

"You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to find God, if
you insist on deserting your ordinary responsibilities! You cannot
work out your past karma {FN4-2} without worldly experiences."

Krishna's immortal words rose to my lips in reply: "'Even he with
the worst of karma who ceaselessly meditates on Me quickly loses
the effects of his past bad actions. Becoming a high-souled being,
he soon attains perennial peace. Arjuna, know this for certain:
the devotee who puts his trust in Me never perishes!'" {FN4-3}

But the forceful prognostications of the young man had slightly
shaken my confidence. With all the fervor of my heart I prayed
silently to God:

"Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, right here and now, if
Thou dost desire me to lead the life of a renunciate or a worldly
man!"

I noticed a SADHU of noble countenance standing just outside
the compound of the pundit's house. Evidently he had overheard
the spirited conversation between the self-styled clairvoyant and
myself, for the stranger called me to his side. I felt a tremendous
power flowing from his calm eyes.

"Son, don't listen to that ignoramus. In response to your prayer,
the Lord tells me to assure you that your sole path in this life
is that of the renunciate."

With astonishment as well as gratitude, I smiled happily at this
decisive message.

"Come away from that man!" The "ignoramus" was calling me from the
courtyard. My saintly guide raised his hand in blessing and slowly
departed.

"That SADHU is just as crazy as you are." It was the hoary-headed
pundit who made this charming observation. He and his son were
gazing at me lugubriously. "I heard that he too has left his home
in a vague search for God."

I turned away. To Ananta I remarked that I would not engage in
further discussion with our hosts. My brother agreed to an immediate
departure; we soon entrained for Calcutta.

[Illustration: I stand behind my elder brother, Ananta.--see

right, in the large courtyard of his hermitage in Serampore.--see

"Mr. Detective, how did you discover I had fled with two companions?"
I vented my lively curiosity to Ananta during our homeward journey.
He smiled mischievously.

"At your school, I found that Amar had left his classroom and had
not returned. I went to his home the next morning and unearthed a
marked timetable. Amar's father was just leaving by carriage and
was talking to the coachman.

"'My son will not ride with me to his school this morning. He has
disappeared!' the father moaned.

"'I heard from a brother coachman that your son and two others,
dressed in European suits, boarded the train at Howrah Station,'
the man stated. 'They made a present of their leather shoes to the
cab driver.'

"Thus I had three clues-the timetable, the trio of boys, and the
English clothing."

I was listening to Ananta's disclosures with mingled mirth and
vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had been slightly misplaced!

"Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all
the cities which Amar had underlined in the timetable. He had checked
Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there. After inquiries
in our Calcutta neighborhood, I learned that cousin Jatinda had
been absent one night but had arrived home the following morning
in European garb.  I sought him out and invited him to dinner. He
accepted, quite disarmed by my friendly manner. On the way I led him
unsuspectingly to a police station. He was surrounded by several
officers whom I had previously selected for their ferocious
appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda agreed to account
for his mysterious conduct.

"'I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant spiritual mood,' he
explained. 'Inspiration filled me at the prospect of meeting the
masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, "During our ecstasies in the
Himalayan caves, tigers will be spellbound and sit around us like
tame pussies," my spirits froze; beads of perspiration formed on
my brow.  "What then?" I thought. "If the vicious nature of the
tigers be not changed through the power of our spiritual trance,
shall they treat us with the kindness of house cats?" In my mind's
eye, I already saw myself the compulsory inmate of some tiger's
stomach-entering there not at once with the whole body, but by
installments of its several parts!'"

My anger at Jatinda's vanishment was evaporated in laughter. The
hilarious sequel on the train was worth all the anguish he had
caused me. I must confess to a slight feeling of satisfaction:
Jatinda too had not escaped an encounter with the police!

"Ananta, {FN4-4} you are a born sleuthhound!" My glance of amusement
was not without some exasperation. "And I shall tell Jatinda I am
glad he was prompted by no mood of treachery, as it appeared, but
only by the prudent instinct of self-preservation!"

At home in Calcutta, Father touchingly requested me to curb my roving
feet until, at least, the completion of my high school studies.
In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for
a saintly pundit, Swami Kebalananda, {FN4-5} to come regularly to
the house.

"The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor," my parent announced
confidently.

Father hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions
from a learned philosopher. But the tables were subtly turned: my
new teacher, far from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the
embers of my God-aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda
was an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The peerless guru had
possessed thousands of disciples, silently drawn to him by the
irresistibility of his divine magnetism. I learned later that Lahiri
Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as RISHI or illumined
sage.

Luxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark eyes were
guileless, with the transparency of a child's. All the movements of
his slight body were marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle
and loving, he was firmly established in the infinite consciousness.
Many of our happy hours together were spent in deep KRIYA meditation.

Kebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient SHASTRAS or sacred
books: his erudition had earned him the title of "Shastri Mahasaya,"
by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit
scholarship was unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake
prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor
obliged me one day by telling me something of his own life with
the master.

"Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for
ten years. His Benares home was my nightly goal of pilgrimage. The
guru was always present in a small front parlor on the first floor.
As he sat in lotus posture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples
garlanded him in a semicircle. His eyes sparkled and danced with
the joy of the Divine. They were ever half closed, peering through
the inner telescopic orb into a sphere of eternal bliss. He seldom
spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze would focus on a student in
need of help; healing words poured then like an avalanche of light.

"An indescribable peace blossomed within me at the master's glance.
I was permeated with his fragrance, as though from a lotus of
infinity.  To be with him, even without exchanging a word for days,
was experience which changed my entire being. If any invisible
barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I would meditate at
the guru's feet. There the most tenuous states came easily within
my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in the presence of lesser
teachers. The master was a living temple of God whose secret doors
were open to all disciples through devotion.

"Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpreter of the scriptures.
Effortlessly he dipped into the 'divine library.' Foam of words and
spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He
had the wondrous clavis which unlocked the profound philosophical
science embedded ages ago in the VEDAS. {FN4-6} If asked to explain
the different planes of consciousness mentioned in the ancient
texts, he would smilingly assent.

"'I will undergo those states, and presently tell you what I
perceive.' He was thus diametrically unlike the teachers who commit
scripture to memory and then give forth unrealized abstractions.

"'Please expound the holy stanzas as the meaning occurs to you.'
The taciturn guru often gave this instruction to a near-by disciple.
'I will guide your thoughts, that the right interpretation be
uttered.' In this way many of Lahiri Mahasaya's perceptions came
to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students.

"The master never counseled slavish belief. 'Words are only shells,'
he said. 'Win conviction of God's presence through your own joyous
contact in meditation.'

"No matter what the disciple's problem, the guru advised KRIYA YOGA
for its solution.

"'The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer
present in the body to guide you. This technique cannot be bound,
filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations.
Continue ceaselessly on your path to liberation through KRIYA,
whose power lies in practice.'

"I myself consider KRIYA the most effective device of salvation through
self-effort ever to be evolved in man's search for the Infinite."
Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. "Through its use,
the omnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated
in the flesh of Lahiri Mahasaya and a number of his disciples."

A Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya took place in Kebalananda's
presence. My saintly tutor recounted the story one day, his eyes
remote from the Sanskrit texts before us.

"A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no
light in his eyes, when he faithfully served our master, in whom
the Divine was fully blazing? One morning I sought to speak to
Ramu, but he sat for patient hours fanning the guru with a hand-made
palm-leaf PUNKHA. When the devotee finally left the room, I followed
him.

"'Ramu, how long have you been blind?'

"'From my birth, sir! Never have my eyes been blessed with a glimpse
of the sun.'

"'Our omnipotent guru can help you. Please make a supplication.'

"The following day Ramu diffidently approached Lahiri Mahasaya. The
disciple felt almost ashamed to ask that physical wealth be added
to his spiritual superabundance.

"'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you
to bring His light into my eyes, that I perceive the sun's lesser
glow.'

"'Ramu, someone has connived to put me in a difficult position. I
have no healing power.'

"'Sir, the Infinite One within you can certainly heal.'

"'That is indeed different, Ramu. God's limit is nowhere! He who
ignites the stars and the cells of flesh with mysterious life-effulgence
can surely bring luster of vision into your eyes.'

"The master touched Ramu's forehead at the point between the eyebrows.
{FN4-7} "'Keep your mind concentrated there, and frequently chant
the name of the prophet Rama {FN4-8} for seven days. The splendor
of the sun shall have a special dawn for you.'

"Lo! in one week it was so. For the first time, Ramu beheld the
fair face of nature. The Omniscient One had unerringly directed his
disciple to repeat the name of Rama, adored by him above all other
saints. Ramu's faith was the devotionally ploughed soil in which
the guru's powerful seed of permanent healing sprouted." Kebalananda
was silent for a moment, then paid a further tribute to his guru.

"It was evident in all miracles performed by Lahiri Mahasaya that
he never allowed the ego-principle {FN4-9} to consider itself a
causative force. By perfection of resistless surrender, the master
enabled the Prime Healing Power to flow freely through him.

"The numerous bodies which were spectacularly healed through Lahiri
Mahasaya eventually had to feed the flames of cremation. Since the
Japanese have been permitted to seek their fortunes in other lands,
they have emigrated in vast numbers.

They are now to be found all over the world.

We have spoken about them in Hawaii, but the Sandwich Islanders are
not the only people to protest against them as colonists.

In British Columbia they have arrived in such hordes that the
Government has been considering laws to keep them out in future.

In California there is a strong opposition to them. They are not
desired in Australia, nor in the English colonies in the Pacific
Ocean.

With all these countries making laws against them, and Hawaii
sending them back from her shores, it would seem that the thrifty
Japanese would have to stay in their own country.

However, a haven has just been offered to them in Mexico.

A Japanese syndicate has secured 300,000 acres in the Mexican State
of Chiapas, on which a Japanese colony is to be established. The
land is to be divided into lots of 20 acres, one lot to be assigned
to each family.

The immigrants are to raise coffee, cotton, tobacco, and sugar, and
to introduce certain Japanese industries.

The first party of colonists are now on their way to Mexico, and
it is thought that thousands will follow them.

The Mexicans are said to be quite pleased with the prospect of the
Japanese settling among them. They need a great many laborers; these
they find it very difficult to obtain, and they expect the new
immigrants to be a great help to them.

It will be interesting to watch how the amiable, active Japanese get
along with the fiery, indolent Mexicans.

* * * * *
Hawaii is disturbed over the news that the Japanese cruiser _Naniwa_
is on its way to Honolulu.

She brings with her a special Japanese Commissioner, who will
investigate the immigration matters, and claim from the Government
of the Sandwich Islands the sum of $100,000 damages for preventing
her citizens from landing.

It is reported that the _Naniwa_ has on board three of the emigrants
who were refused admission, and that she will try and land them,
for the purpose of making the Hawaiian Government prove in the
courts its right to forbid their entry.

The Japanese insist that Hawaii has violated the treaty existing
between Japan and the Sandwich Islands.

The Honolulu lawyers have been studying the treaty, and insist
that the immigrants had no legal right to land, and that the treaty
has not been violated.

In the mean while, the Government of Hawaii is doing all in
its power to get white laborers employed instead of Japanese on
all the sugar and coffee plantations. And as it is feared that
the United States will not care to annex the islands if all the
labor is done by Asiatics and there is no room for white men, it
is trying to get Americans to go over with their families, and is
promising them steady and paying employment.

During
that interim I met a number of sages-the "Perfume Saint," the "Tiger
Swami," Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, Master Mahasaya, and the famous
Bengali scientist, Jagadis Chandra Bose.

My encounter with the "Perfume Saint" had two preambles, one
harmonious and the other humorous.

"God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute
values in the relative world of nature."

These philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as I stood
silently before a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronted a
tall man whose garb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering SADHU.

"You have indeed penetrated the bewilderment of my thoughts!" I
smiled gratefully. "The confusion of benign and terrible aspects
in nature, as symbolized by Kali, {FN5-1} has puzzled wiser heads
than mine!"

"Few there be who solve her mystery! Good and evil is the challenging
riddle which life places sphinxlike before every intelligence.
Attempting no solution, most men pay forfeit with their lives,
penalty now even as in the days of Thebes. Here and there, a towering
lonely figure never cries defeat. From the MAYA {FN5-2} of duality
he plucks the cleaveless truth of unity."

"You speak with conviction, sir."

"I have long exercised an honest introspection, the exquisitely
painful approach to wisdom. Self-scrutiny, relentless observance of
one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes
the stoutest ego. But true self-analysis mathematically operates
to produce seers. The way of 'self-expression,' individual
acknowledgments, results in egotists, sure of the right to their
private interpretations of God and the universe."

"Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality."
I was enjoying the discussion.

"Man can understand no eternal verity until he has freed himself
from pretensions. The human mind, bared to a centuried slime, is
teeming with repulsive life of countless world-delusions. Struggles
of the battlefields pale into insignificance here, when man first
contends with inward enemies! No mortal foes these, to be overcome
by harrowing array of might! Omnipresent, unresting, pursuing man
even in sleep, subtly equipped with a miasmic weapon, these soldiers
of ignorant lusts seek to slay us all. Thoughtless is the man who
buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fate. Can he seem
other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?"

"Respected Sir, have you no sympathy for the bewildered masses?"

The sage was silent for a moment, then answered obliquely.

"To love both the invisible God, Repository of All Virtues, and
visible man, apparently possessed of none, is often baffling! But
ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a unity
in all human minds-the stalwart kinship of selfish motive. In one
sense at least, the brotherhood of man stands revealed. An aghast
humility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion
for one's fellows, blind to the healing potencies of the soul
awaiting exploration."

"The saints of every age, sir, have felt like yourself for the
sorrows of the world."

"Only the shallow man loses responsiveness to the woes of others'
lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of his own." The SADHU'S
austere face was noticeably softened. "The one who practices a
scalpel self-dissection will know an expansion of universal pity.
Release is given him from the deafening demands of his ego. The
love of God flowers on such soil. The creature finally turns to
his Creator, if for no other reason than to ask in anguish: 'Why,
Lord, why?' By ignoble whips of pain, man is driven at last into
the Infinite Presence, whose beauty alone should lure him."

The sage and I were present in Calcutta's Kalighat Temple, whither
I had gone to view its famed magnificence. With a sweeping gesture,
my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity.

"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible tune; the heart opens only
to the human chant of being."

We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs
of devotees were passing to and fro.

"You are young." The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. "India too is
young. The ancient RISHIS {FN5-3} laid down ineradicable patterns
of spiritual living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this day
and land.  Not outmoded, not unsophisticated against the guiles
of materialism, the disciplinary precepts mold India still. By
millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the
skeptic Time has validated Vedic worth. Take it for your heritage."

As I was reverently bidding farewell to the eloquent SADHU, he
revealed a clairvoyant perception:

"After you leave here today, an unusual experience will come your
way."

I quitted the temple precincts and wandered along aimlessly. Turning
a corner, I ran into an old acquaintance-one of those long-winded
fellows whose conversational powers ignore time and embrace eternity.

"I will let you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all
that has happened during the six years of our separation."

"What a paradox! I must leave you now."

But he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information.
He was like a ravenous wolf, I thought in amusement; the longer I
spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned
the Goddess Kali to devise a graceful means of escape.

My companion left me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my
pace, dreading any relapse into the garrulous fever. Hearing rapid
footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back.
But with a bound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my
shoulder.

"I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing
yonder house." He pointed to a dwelling a few yards distant. "Do
meet him; he is interesting. You may have an unusual experience.
Good-by," and he actually left me.

The similarly worded prediction of the SADHU at Kalighat Temple
flashed to my mind. Definitely intrigued, I entered the house and
was ushered into a commodious parlor. A crowd of people were sitting,
Orient-wise, here and there on a thick orange-colored carpet. An
awed whisper reached my ear:

"Behold Gandha Baba on the leopard skin. He can give the natural
perfume of any flower to a scentless one, or revive a wilted blossom,
or make a person's skin exude delightful fragrance."

I looked directly at the saint; his quick gaze rested on mine. He
was plump and bearded, with dark skin and large, gleaming eyes.

"Son, I am glad to see you. Say what you want. Would you like some
perfume?"

"What for?" I thought his remark rather childish.

"To experience the miraculous way of enjoying perfumes."

"Harnessing God to make odors?"

"What of it? God makes perfume anyway."

"Yes, but He fashions frail bottles of petals for fresh use and
discard. Can you materialize flowers?"

"I materialize perfumes, little friend."

"Then scent factories will go out of business."

"I will permit them to keep their trade! My own purpose is to
demonstrate the power of God."

"Sir, is it necessary to prove God? Isn't He performing miracles
in everything, everywhere?"

"Yes, but we too should manifest some of His infinite creative
variety."

"How long did it take to master your art?"

"Twelve years."

"For manufacturing scents by astral means! It seems, my honored
saint, you have been wasting a dozen years for fragrances which
you can obtain with a few rupees from a florist's shop."

"Perfumes fade with flowers."

"Perfumes fade with death. Why should I desire that which pleases
the body only?"

"Mr. Philosopher, you please my mind. Now, stretch forth your right
hand." He made a gesture of blessing.

I was a few feet away from Gandha Baba; no one else was near
enough to contact my body. I extended my hand, which the yogi did
not touch.

"What perfume do you want?"

"Rose."

"Be it so."

To my great surprise, the charming fragrance of rose was wafted
strongly from the center of my palm. I smilingly took a large white
scentless flower from a near-by vase.

"Can this odorless blossom be permeated with jasmine?"

"Be it so."

A jasmine fragrance instantly shot from the petals. I thanked the
wonder-worker and seated myself by one of his students. He informed
me that Gandha Baba, whose proper name was Vishudhananda, had
learned many astonishing yoga secrets from a master in Tibet. The
Tibetan yogi, I was assured, had attained the age of over a thousand
years.

"His disciple Gandha Baba does not always perform his perfume-feats
in the simple verbal manner you have just witnessed." The student
spoke with obvious pride in his master. "His procedure differs
widely, to accord with diversity in temperaments. He is marvelous!
Many members of the Calcutta intelligentsia are among his followers."

I inwardly resolved not to add myself to their number. A guru too
literally "marvelous" was not to my liking. With polite thanks to
Gandha Baba, I departed. Sauntering home, I reflected on the three
varied encounters the day had brought forth.

My sister Uma met me as I entered our Gurpar Road door.

"You are getting quite stylish, using perfumes!"

Without a word, I motioned her to smell my hand.

"What an attractive rose fragrance! It is unusually strong!"

Thinking it was "strongly unusual," I silently placed the astrally
scented blossom under her nostrils.

"Oh, I love jasmine!" She seized the flower. A ludicrous bafflement
passed over her face as she repeatedly sniffed the odor of jasmine
from a type of flower she well knew to be scentless. Her reactions
disarmed my suspicion that Gandha Baba had induced an auto-suggestive
state whereby I alone could detect the fragrances.

Later I heard from a friend, Alakananda, that the "Perfume Saint"
had a power which I wish were possessed by the starving millions
of Asia and, today, of Europe as well.

"I was present with a hundred other guests at Gandha Baba's home
in Burdwan," Alakananda told me. "It was a gala occasion. Because
the yogi was reputed to have the power of extracting objects
out of thin air, I laughingly requested him to materialize some
out-of-season tangerines. Immediately the LUCHIS {FN5-4} which
were present on all the banana-leaf plates became puffed up. Each
of the bread-envelopes proved to contain a peeled tangerine. I bit
into my own with some trepidation, but found it delicious."

Years later I understood by inner realization how Gandha Baba
accomplished his materializations. The method, alas! is beyond the
reach of the world's hungry hordes.

The different sensory stimuli to which man reacts-tactual, visual,
gustatory, auditory, and olfactory-are produced by vibratory
variations in electrons and protons. The vibrations in turn are
regulated by "lifetrons," subtle life forces or finer-than-atomic
energies intelligently charged with the five distinctive sensory
idea-substances.

Gandha Baba, tuning himself with the cosmic force by certain yogic
practices, was able to guide the lifetrons to rearrange their
vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume,
fruit and other miracles were actual materializations of mundane
vibrations, and not inner sensations hypnotically produced. {FN5-5}

Performances of miracles such as shown by the "Perfume Saint" are
spectacular but spiritually useless. Having little purpose beyond
entertainment, they are digressions from a serious search for God.

Hypnotism has been used by physicians in minor operations as a sort
of psychical chloroform for persons who might be endangered by an
anesthetic. But a hypnotic state is harmful to those often subjected to
it; a negative psychological effect ensues which in time deranges
the brain cells. Hypnotism is trespass into the territory of
another's consciousness. Its temporary phenomena have nothing in
common with the miracles performed by men of divine realization.
Awake in God, true saints effect changes in this dream-world by
means of a will harmoniously attuned to the Creative Cosmic Dreamer.

Ostentatious display of unusual powers are decried by masters. The
Persian mystic, Abu Said, once laughed at certain FAKIRS who were
proud of their miraculous powers over water, air, and space.

"A frog is also at home in the water!" Abu Said pointed out in gentle
scorn. "The crow and the vulture easily fly in the air; the Devil
is simultaneously present in the East and in the West! A true man
is he who dwells in righteousness among his fellow men, who buys
and sells, yet is never for a single instant forgetful of God!"
On another occasion the great Persian teacher gave his views on
the religious life thus: "To lay aside what you have in your head
(selfish desires and ambitions); to freely bestow what you have in
your hand; and never to flinch from the blows of adversity!"

Neither the impartial sage at Kalighat Temple nor the Tibetan-trained
yogi had satisfied my yearning for a guru. My heart needed no
tutor for its recognitions, and cried its own "Bravos!" the more
resoundingly because unoften summoned from silence. When I finally
met my master, he taught me by sublimity of example alone the
measure of a true man.

{FN5-1} Kali represents the eternal principle in nature. She is
traditionally pictured as a four-armed woman, standing on the form
of the God Shiva or the Infinite, because nature or the phenomenal
world is rooted in the Noumenon. The four arms symbolize cardinal
attributes, two beneficent, two destructive, indicating the essential
duality of matter or creation.

{FN5-2} Cosmic illusion; literally, "the measurer." MAYA is the
magical power in creation by which limitations and divisions are
apparently present in the Immeasurable and Inseparable.  Emerson
wrote the following poem, to which he gave the title of MAYA:

Illusion works impenetrable,
Weaving webs innumerable,
Her gay pictures never fail,
Crowd each other, veil on veil,
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived.

{FN5-3} The RISHIS, literally "seers," were the authors of the
VEDAS in an indeterminable antiquity..

{FN5-4} Flat, round Indian bread..

{FN5-5} Laymen scarcely realize the vast strides of twentieth-century
science. Transmutation of metals and other alchemical dreams are
seeing fulfillment every day in centers of scientific research over
the world. The eminent French chemist, M. Georges Claude, performed
"miracles" at Fontainebleau in 1928 before a scientific assemblage
through his chemical knowledge of oxygen transformations. His
"magician's wand" was simple oxygen, bubbling in a tube on a table.
The scientist "turned a handful of sand into precious stones,
iron into a state resembling melted chocolate and, after depriving
flowers of their tints, turned them into the consistency of glass.

"M. Claude explained how the sea could be turned by oxygen
transformations into many millions of pounds of horsepower; how
water which boils is not necessarily burning; how little mounds of
sand, by a single whiff of the oxygen blowpipe, could be changed
into sapphires, rubies, and topazes; and he predicted the time when
it will be possible for men to walk on the bottom of the ocean minus
the diver's equipment. Finally the scientist amazed his onlookers
by turning their faces black by taking the red out of the sun's
rays."

This noted French scientist has produced liquid air by an expansion
method in which he has been able to separate the various gases of
the air, and has discovered various means of mechanical utilization
of differences of temperature in sea water.


CHAPTER: 6

THE TIGER SWAMI

"I have discovered the Tiger Swami's address. Let us visit him
tomorrow."

This welcome suggestion came from Chandi, one of my high school
friends. I was eager to meet the saint who, in his premonastic
life, had caught and fought tigers with his naked hands. A boyish
enthusiasm over such remarkable feats was strong within me.

The next day dawned wintry cold, but Chandi and I sallied forth
gaily.  After much vain hunting in Bhowanipur, outside Calcutta, we
arrived at the right house. The door held two iron rings, which I
sounded piercingly. Notwithstanding the clamor, a servant approached
with leisurely gait. His ironical smile implied that visitors,
despite their noise, were powerless to disturb the calmness of a
saint's home.

Feeling the silent rebuke, my companion and I were thankful to be
invited into the parlor. Our long wait there caused uncomfortable
misgivings. India's unwritten law for the truth seeker is patience;
a master may purposely make a test of one's eagerness to meet him.
This psychological ruse is freely employed in the West by doctors
and dentists!

Finally summoned by the servant, Chandi and I entered a sleeping
apartment. The famous Sohong {FN6-1} Swami was seated on his bed.
The sight of his tremendous body affected us strangely. With bulging
eyes, we stood speechless. We had never before seen such a chest or
such football-like biceps. On an immense neck, the swami's fierce
yet calm face was adorned with flowing locks, beard and moustache.
A hint of dovelike and tigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes.
He was unclothed, save for a tiger skin about his muscular waist.

Finding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing
our admiration for his prowess in the extraordinary feline arena.

"Will you not tell us, please, how it is possible to subdue with
bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts, the royal Bengals?"

"My sons, it is nothing to me to fight tigers. I could do it today
if necessary." He gave a childlike laugh. "You look upon tigers as
tigers; I know them as pussycats."

"Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the
thought that tigers are pussycats, but could I make tigers believe
it?"

"Of course strength also is necessary! One cannot expect victory
from a baby who imagines a tiger to be a house cat! Powerful hands
are my sufficient weapon."

He asked us to follow him to the patio, where he struck the edge
of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the sky peered boldly
through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in
astonishment; he who can remove mortared bricks from a solid wall
with one blow, I thought, must surely be able to displace the teeth
of tigers!

"A number of men have physical power such as mine, but still lack
in cool confidence. Those who are bodily but not mentally stalwart
may find themselves fainting at mere sight of a wild beast bounding
freely in the jungle. The tiger in its natural ferocity and habitat
is vastly different from the opium-fed circus animal!

"Many a man with herculean strength has nonetheless been terrorized
into abject helplessness before the onslaught of a royal Bengal.
Thus the tiger has converted the man, in his own mind, to a state
as nerveless as the pussycat's. It is possible for a man, owning a
fairly strong body and an immensely strong determination, to turn
the tables on the tiger, and force it to a conviction of pussycat
defenselessness. How often I have done just that!"

I was quite willing to believe that the titan before me was able to
perform the tiger-pussycat metamorphosis. He seemed in a didactic
mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully.

"Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends
on the energy applied; the power expressed by a man's bodily instrument
depends on his aggressive will and courage. The body is literally
manufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts
from past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into
human consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify
into a desirable or an undesirable body. Outward frailty has
mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-bound body thwarts
the mind. If the master allows himself to be commanded by a servant,
the latter becomes autocratic; the mind is similarly enslaved by
submitting to bodily dictation."

At our entreaty, the impressive swami consented to tell us something
of his own life.

"My earliest ambition was to fight tigers. My will was mighty, but
my body was feeble."

An ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible
that this man, now "with Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear," could
ever have known weakness.

"It was by indomitable persistency in thoughts of health and
strength that I overcame my handicap. I have every reason to extol
the compelling mental vigor which I found to be the real subduer
of royal Bengals."

"Do you think, revered swami, that I could ever fight tigers?" This
was the first, and the last, time that the bizarre ambition ever
visited my mind!

"Yes." He was smiling. "But there are many kinds of tigers; some
roam in jungles of human desires. No spiritual benefit accrues
by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner
prowlers."

"May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to
a tamer of wild passions?"

The Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remoteness came into his gaze,
summoning visions of bygone years. I discerned his slight mental
struggle to decide whether to grant my request. Finally he smiled
in acquiescence.

"When my fame reached a zenith, it brought the intoxication of
pride.  I decided not only to fight tigers but to display them in
various tricks. My ambition was to force savage beasts to behave
like domesticated ones. I began to perform my feats publicly, with
gratifying success.

"One evening my father entered my room in pensive mood.

"'Son, I have words of warning. I would save you from coming ills,
produced by the grinding wheels of cause and effect.'

"'Are you a fatalist, Father? Should superstition be allowed to
discolor the powerful waters or my activities?'

"'I am no fatalist, son. But I believe in the just law of retribution,
as taught in the holy scriptures. There is resentment against you
in the jungle family; sometime it may act to your cost.'

"'Father, you astonish me! You well know what tigers are-beautiful
but merciless! Even immediately after an enormous meal of some
hapless creature, a tiger is fired with fresh lust at sight of new
prey. It may be a joyous gazelle, frisking over the jungle grass.
Capturing it and biting an opening in the soft throat, the malevolent
beast tastes only a little of the mutely crying blood, and goes
its wanton way.

"'Tigers are the most contemptible of the jungle breed! Who knows?
my blows may inject some slight sanity of consideration into their
thick heads. I am headmaster in a forest finishing school, to teach
them gentle manners!

"'Please, Father, think of me as tiger tamer and never as tiger
killer. How could my good actions bring ill upon me? I beg you not
to impose any command that I change my way of life.'"

Chandi and I were all attention, understanding the past dilemma.
In India a child does not lightly disobey his parents' wishes.

"In stoic silence Father listened to my explanation. He followed
it with a disclosure which he uttered gravely.

"'Son, you compel me to relate an ominous prediction from the lips
of a saint. He approached me yesterday as I sat on the veranda in
my daily meditation.

"'"Dear friend, I come with a message for your belligerent son. Let
him cease his savage activities. Otherwise, his next tiger-encounter
shall result in his severe wounds, followed by six months of deathly
sickness. He shall then forsake his former ways and become a monk."'

"This tale did not impress me. I considered that Father had been
the credulous victim of a deluded fanatic."

The Tiger Swami made this confession with an impatient gesture, as
though at some stupidity. Grimly silent for a long time, he seemed
oblivious of our presence. When he took up the dangling thread of
his narrative, it was suddenly, with subdued voice.

"Not long after Father's warning, I visited the capital city of
Cooch Behar. The picturesque territory was new to me, and I expected
a restful change. As usual everywhere, a curious crowd followed me
on the streets. I would catch bits of whispered comment:

"'This is the man who fights wild tigers.'

"'Has he legs, or tree-trunks?'

"'Look at his face! He must be an incarnation of the king of tigers
himself!'

"You know how village urchins function like final editions of a
newspaper! With what speed do the even-later speech-bulletins of
the women circulate from house to house! Within a few hours, the
whole city was in a state of excitement over my presence.

"I was relaxing quietly in the evening, when I heard the hoofbeats
of galloping horses. They stopped in front of my dwelling place.
In came a number of tall, turbaned policemen.

"I was taken aback. 'All things are possible unto these creatures
of human law,' I thought. 'I wonder if they are going to take me to
task about matters utterly unknown to me.' But the officers bowed
with unwonted courtesy.

"'Honored Sir, we are sent to welcome you on behalf of the Prince
of Cooch Behar. He is pleased to invite you to his palace tomorrow
morning.'

"I speculated awhile on the prospect. For some obscure reason I
felt sharp regret at this interruption in my quiet trip. But the
suppliant manner of the policemen moved me; I agreed to go.

"I was bewildered the next day to be obsequiously escorted from my
door into a magnificent coach drawn by four horses. A servant held
an ornate umbrella to protect me from the scorching sunlight. I
enjoyed the pleasant ride through the city and its woodland outskirts.
The royal scion himself was at the palace door to welcome me. He
proffered his own gold-brocaded seat, smilingly placing himself in
a chair of simpler design.

"'All this politeness is certainly going to cost me something!' I
thought in mounting astonishment. The prince's motive emerged after
a few casual remarks.

"'My city is filled with the rumor that you can fight wild tigers
with nothing more than your naked hands. Is it a fact?'

"'It is quite true.'

"'I can scarcely believe it! You are a Calcutta Bengali, nurtured
on the white rice of city folk. Be frank, please; have you not been
fighting only spineless, opium-fed animals?' His voice was loud
and sarcastic, tinged with provincial accent.

"I vouchsafed no reply to his insulting question.

"'I challenge you to fight my newly-caught tiger, Raja Begum.
{FN6-2} If you can successfully resist him, bind him with a chain,
and leave his cage in a conscious state, you shall have this royal
Bengal! Several thousand rupees and many other gifts shall also be
bestowed. If you refuse to meet him in combat, I shall blazon your
name throughout the state as an impostor!'

"His insolent words struck me like a volley of bullets. I shot an
angry acceptance. Half risen from the chair in his excitement, the
prince sank back with a sadistic smile. I was reminded of the Roman
emperors who delighted in setting Christians in bestial arenas.

"'The match will be set for a week hence. I regret that I cannot
give you permission to view the tiger in advance.'

"Whether the prince feared I might seek to hypnotize the beast, or
secretly feed him opium, I know not!

"I left the palace, noting with amusement that the royal umbrella
and panoplied coach were now missing.

"The following week I methodically prepared my mind and body for
the coming ordeal. Through my servant I learned of fantastic tales.
The saint's direful prediction to my father had somehow got abroad,
enlarging as it ran. Many simple villagers believed that an evil
spirit, cursed by the gods, had reincarnated as a tiger which took
various demoniac forms at night, but remained a striped animal
during the day. This demon-tiger was supposed to be the one sent
to humble me.

"Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger
Heaven had achieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was
to be the instrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insulting
to the entire tiger species! A furless, fangless man daring
to challenge a claw-armed, sturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated
venom of all humiliated tigers-the villagers declared-had gathered
momentum sufficient to operate hidden laws and bring about the fall
of the proud tiger tamer.

"My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element
as manager of the bout between man and beast. He had supervised
the erection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate
thousands.  Its center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage,
surrounded by an outer safety room. The captive emitted a ceaseless
series of blood-curdling roars. He was fed sparingly, to kindle a
wrathful appetite.  Perhaps the prince expected me to be the meal
of reward!

"Crowds from the city and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response
to the beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The day of
battle saw hundreds turned away for lack of seats. Many men broke
through the tent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries."

As the Tiger Swami's story approached a climax, my excitement
mounted with it; Chandi also was raptly mute.

"Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub
of the somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly made my appearance. Scantily
clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I
opened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked
it behind me. The tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous
crash on his bars, he sent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience
was hushed with pitiful fear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging
beast.

"In a trice I was within the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja
Begum was headlong upon me. My right hand was desperately torn.
Human blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling
streams.  The prophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.

"I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury
I had ever received. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by
thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a
bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back, swirled around the rear
of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic
punishment rained on his head.

"But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted like the maddening first
sip of wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening
roar, the brute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense
of only one hand left me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I
dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled
as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in
all directions, and blasts of pain and lethal lust came from the
bestial throat.

"'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks arose from the audience.
So fast did man and beast move, that a guard's bullet went amiss.
I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final
concussive blow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly.

"Like a pussycat!" I interjected.

The swami laughed in hearty appreciation, then continued the
engrossing tale.

"Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further
humbled: with my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his
jaws.  For a dramatic moment, I held my head within the yawning
deathtrap. I looked around for a chain. Pulling one from a pile
on the floor, I bound the tiger by his neck to the cage bars. In
triumph I moved toward the door.

"But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his
supposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped
the chain and leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I
fell violently. But in a trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under
merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness.
This time I secured him more carefully. Slowly I left the cage.

"I found myself in a new uproar, this time one of delight. The crowd's
cheer broke as though from a single gigantic throat. Disastrously
mauled, I had yet fulfilled the three conditions of the fight-stunning
the tiger, binding him with a chain, and leaving him without
requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so drastically
injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content
to overlook the opportune prize of my head in his mouth!

"After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds of
gold pieces showered at my feet. The whole city entered a holiday
period. Endless discussions were heard on all sides about my
victory over one of the largest and most savage tigers ever seen.
Raja Begum was presented to me, as promised, but I felt no elation.
A spiritual change had entered my heart. It seemed that with my
final exit from the cage I had also closed the door on my worldly
ambitions.

"A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near death from
blood poisoning. As soon as I was well enough to leave Cooch Behar,
I returned to my native town.

"'I know now that my teacher is the holy man who gave the wise
warning.' I humbly made this confession to my father. 'Oh, if I
could only find him!' My longing was sincere, for one day the saint
arrived unheralded.

"'Enough of tiger taming.' He spoke with calm assurance. 'Come with
me; I will teach you to subdue the beasts of ignorance roaming in
jungles of the human mind. You are used to an audience: let it be
a galaxy of angels, entertained by your thrilling mastery of yoga!'

"I was initiated into the spiritual path by my saintly guru. He
opened my soul-doors, rusty and resistant with long disuse. Hand
in hand, we soon set out for my training in the Himalayas."

Chandi and I bowed at the swami's feet, grateful for his vivid
outline of a life truly cyclonic. I felt amply repaid for the long
probationary wait in the cold parlor!

{FN6-1} SOHONG was his monastic name. He was popularly known as
the "Tiger Swami."

{FN6-2} "Prince Princess"-so named to indicate that this beast
possessed the combined ferocity of tiger and tigress.


CHAPTER: 7

THE LEVITATING SAINT

"I saw a yogi remain in the air, several feet above the ground,
last night at a group meeting." My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury,
spoke impressively.

I gave him an enthusiastic smile. "Perhaps I can guess his name.
Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?"

Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My
inquisitiveness about saints was well-known among my friends; they
delighted in setting me on a fresh track.

"The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him." My
words brought keen interest to Upendra's face, and I made a further
confidence.

"I have seen him in remarkable feats. He has expertly mastered the
various PRANAYAMAS {FN7-1} of the ancient eightfold yoga outlined
by Patanjali. {FN7-2} Once Bhaduri Mahasaya performed the BHASTRIKA
PRANAYAMA before me with such amazing force that it seemed an actual
storm had arisen in the room! Then he extinguished the thundering
breath and remained motionless in a high state of superconsciousness.
{FN7-3} The aura of peace after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting."

"I heard that the saint never leaves his home." Upendra's tone was
a trifle incredulous.

"Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years.
He slightly relaxes his self-imposed rule at the times of our holy
festivals, when he goes as far as his front sidewalk! The beggars
gather there, because Saint Bhaduri is known for his tender heart."

"How does he remain in the air, defying the law of gravitation?"

"A yogi's body loses its grossness after use of certain PRANAYAMAS.
Then it will levitate or hop about like a leaping frog. Even
saints who do not practice a formal yoga {FN7-4} have been known
to levitate during a state of intense devotion to God."

"I would like to know more of this sage. Do you attend his evening
meetings?" Upendra's eyes were sparkling with curiosity.

"Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his
wisdom.  Occasionally my prolonged laughter mars the solemnity of
his gatherings. The saint is not displeased, but his disciples look
daggers!"

On my way home from school that afternoon, I passed Bhaduri Mahasaya's
cloister and decided on a visit. The yogi was inaccessible to the
general public. A lone disciple, occupying the ground floor, guarded
his master's privacy. The student was something of a martinet; he
now inquired formally if I had an "engagement." His guru put in an
appearance just in time to save me from summary ejection.

"Let Mukunda come when he will." The sage's eyes twinkled. "My rule
of seclusion is not for my own comfort, but for that of others.
Worldly people do not like the candor which shatters their delusions.
Saints are not only rare but disconcerting. Even in scripture, they
are often found embarrassing!"

I followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor,
from which he seldom stirred. Masters often ignore the panorama
of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The
contemporaries of a sage are not alone those of the narrow present.

"Maharishi, {FN7-5} you are the first yogi I have known who always
stays indoors."

"God plants his saints sometimes in unexpected soil, lest we think
we may reduce Him to a rule!"

The sage locked his vibrant body in the lotus posture. In his
seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age or sedentary life.
Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in every respect. His face was
that of a RISHI, as described in the ancient texts. Noble-headed,
abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet eyes
fixed on Omnipresence.

The saint and I entered the meditative state. After an hour, his
gentle voice roused me.

"You go often into the silence, but have you developed ANUBHAVA?"
{FN7-6} He was reminding me to love God more than meditation.  "Do
not mistake the technique for the Goal."

He offered me some mangoes. With that good-humored wit that I found
so delightful in his grave nature, he remarked, "People in general
are more fond of JALA YOGA (union with food) than of DHYANA YOGA
(union with God)."

His yogic pun affected me uproariously.

"What a laugh you have!" An affectionate gleam came into his gaze.
His own face was always serious, yet touched with an ecstatic smile.
His large, lotus eyes held a hidden divine laughter.

"Those letters come from far-off America." The sage indicated several
thick envelopes on a table. "I correspond with a few societies
there whose members are interested in yoga. They are discovering
India anew, with a better sense of direction than Columbus! I am
glad to help them. The knowledge of yoga is free to all who will
receive, like the ungarnishable daylight.

"What RISHIS perceived as essential for human salvation need not
be diluted for the West. Alike in soul though diverse in outer
experience, neither West nor East will flourish if some form of
disciplinary yoga be not practiced."

The saint held me with his tranquil eyes. I did not realize that
his speech was a veiled prophetic guidance. It is only now, as I
write these words, that I understand the full meaning in the casual
intimations he often gave me that someday I would carry India's
teachings to America.

[Illustration: BHADURI MAHASAYA, "The Levitating Saint" "Sir,"
I inquired, "why do you not write a book on yoga for the benefit
of the world?" "I am training disciples," He replied. "They and
their students will be living volumes, proof against the natural
disintegrations of time and the unnatural interpretaations of the
critics."--see badhuri.jpg]

"Maharishi, I wish you would write a book on yoga for the benefit
of the world."

"I am training disciples. They and their students will be living
volumes, proof against the natural disintegrations of time and the
unnatural interpretations of the critics." Bhaduri's wit put me
into another gale of laughter.

I remained alone with the yogi until his disciples arrived in the
evening. Bhaduri Mahasaya entered one of his inimitable discourses.
Like a peaceful flood, he swept away the mental debris of his listeners,
floating them Godward. His striking parables were expressed in a
flawless Bengali.

This evening Bhaduri expounded various philosophical points
connected with the life of Mirabai, a medieval Rajputani princess
who abandoned her court life to seek the company of sadhus. One
great-sannyasi refused to receive her because she was a woman; her
reply brought him humbly to her feet.

"Tell the master," she had said, "that I did not know there was
any Male in the universe save God; are we all not females before
Him?" (A scriptural conception of the Lord as the only Positive
Creative Principle, His creation being naught but a passive MAYA.)

Mirabai composed many ecstatic songs which are still treasured in
India; I translate one of them here:

  "If by bathing daily God could be realized
  Sooner would I be a whale in the deep;
  If by eating roots and fruits He could be known
  Gladly would I choose the form of a goat;
  If the counting of rosaries uncovered Him
  I would say my prayers on mammoth beads;
  If bowing before stone images unveiled Him
  A flinty mountain I would humbly worship;
  If by drinking milk the Lord could be imbibed
  Many calves and children would know Him;
  If abandoning one's wife would summon God
  Would not thousands be eunuchs?
  Mirabai knows that to find the Divine One
  The only indispensable is Love."

Several students put rupees in Bhaduri's slippers which lay by his
side as he sat in yoga posture. This respectful offering, customary
in India, indicates that the disciple places his material goods at
the guru's feet. Grateful friends are only the Lord in disguise,
looking after His own.

"Master, you are wonderful!" A student, taking his leave, gazed
ardently at the patriarchal sage. "You have renounced riches and
comforts to seek God and teach us wisdom!" It was well-known that
Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken great family wealth in his early
childhood, when single-mindedly he entered the yogic path.

"You are reversing the case!" The saint's face held a mild rebuke.
"I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic
empire of endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything?
I know the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The
shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates! They
relinquish an unparalleled divine possession for a poor handful of
earthly toys!"

I chuckled over this paradoxical view of renunciation-one which
puts the cap of Croesus on any saintly beggar, whilst transforming
all proud millionaires into unconscious martyrs.

"The divine order arranges our future more wisely than any insurance
company." The master's concluding words were the realized creed
of his faith. "The world is full of uneasy believers in an outward
security.  Their bitter thoughts are like scars on their foreheads.
The One who gave us air and milk from our first breath knows how
to provide day by day for His devotees."

I continued my after-school pilgrimages to the saint's door. With
silent zeal he aided me to attain ANUBHAVA. One day he moved to
Ram Mohan Roy Road, away from the neighborhood of my Gurpar Road
home. His loving disciples had built him a new hermitage, known as
"Nagendra Math." {FN7-7}

Although it throws me ahead of my story by a number of years, I
will recount here the last words given to me by Bhaduri Mahasaya.
Shortly before I embarked for the West, I sought him out and humbly
knelt for his farewell blessing:

"Son, go to America. Take the dignity of hoary India for your
shield.  Victory is written on your brow; the noble distant people
will well receive you."

{FN7-1} Methods of controlling life-force through regulation of
breath.

{FN7-2} The foremost ancient exponent of yoga.

{FN7-3} French professors were the first in the West to be willing
to scientifically investigate the possibilities of the superconscious
mind. Professor Jules-Bois, member of the L'Ecole de Psychologie of
the Sorbonne, lectured in America in 1928; he told his audiences that
French scientists have accorded recognition to the superconsciousness,
"which is the exact opposite of Freud's subconscious mind and is the
faculty which makes man really man and not just a super-animal." M.
Jules-Bois explained that the awakening of the higher consciousness
"was not to be confused with Coueism or hypnotism. The existence
of a superconscious mind has long been recognized philosophically,
being in reality the Oversoul spoken of by Emerson, but only recently
has it been recognized scientifically." The French scientist pointed
out that from the superconsciousness come inspiration, genius, moral
values.  "Belief in this is not mysticism though it recognized and
valued the qualities which mystics preached."

CHAPTER: 8

INDIA'S GREAT SCIENTIST, J.C. BOSE

"Jagadis Chandra Bose's wireless inventions antedated those of
Marconi."

Overhearing this provocative remark, I walked closer to a sidewalk
group of professors engaged in scientific discussion. If my motive
in joining them was racial pride, I regret it. I cannot deny my
keen interest in evidence that India can play a leading part in
physics, and not metaphysics alone.

"What do you mean, sir?"

The professor obligingly explained. "Bose was the first one to invent
a wireless coherer and an instrument for indicating the refraction
of electric waves. But the Indian scientist did not exploit his
inventions commercially. He soon turned his attention from the
inorganic to the organic world. His revolutionary discoveries as a
plant physiologist are outpacing even his radical achievements as
a physicist."

I politely thanked my mentor. He added, "The great scientist is
one of my brother professors at Presidency College."

I paid a visit the next day to the sage at his home, which was close
to mine on Gurpar Road. I had long admired him from a respectful
distance. The grave and retiring botanist greeted me graciously. He
was a handsome, robust man in his fifties, with thick hair, broad
forehead, and the abstracted eyes of a dreamer. The precision in
his tones revealed the lifelong scientific habit.

"I have recently returned from an expedition to scientific societies
of the West. Their members exhibited intense interest in delicate
instruments of my invention which demonstrate the indivisible unity
of all life. {FN8-1} The Bose crescograph has the enormity of ten
million magnifications. The microscope enlarges only a few thousand
times; yet it brought vital impetus to biological science. The
crescograph opens incalculable vistas."

"You have done much, sir, to hasten the embrace of East and West
in the impersonal arms of science."

"I was educated at Cambridge. How admirable is the Western method
of submitting all theory to scrupulous experimental verification!
That empirical procedure has gone hand in hand with the gift for
introspection which is my Eastern heritage. Together they have enabled
me to sunder the silences of natural realms long uncommunicative.
Even at this stage there was a certain individuality of character
among the puppies. Some of them squealed and some of them growled
when dragged out to die. One or two tried to bite. The one that
had been slowest to comprehend the danger, had been the last to
retreat, and so was on top of the pile, and therefore the first
killed.

The one that had first realized the peril had retreated first, and
now crouched at the bottom of the pile. Coolly and remorselessly
the others were killed one by one, and then this prudent little
puppy was seen to be the last of the family. It lay perfectly still,
even when touched, its eyes being half closed, as, guided by
instinct, it tried to "play possum."

One of the men picked it up. It neither squealed nor resisted.
Then Jake, realizing ever the importance of "standing in with the
boss," said: "Say, let's keep that 'un for the children."

So the last of the family was thrown alive into the same bag
with its dead brothers, and, bruised and frightened, lay there very
still, understanding nothing, knowing only that after a long time
of great noise and cruel jolting it was again half strangled by a
grip on its neck and dragged out, where were a lot of creatures
like the diggers.

These were really the inhabitants of the Chimneypot Ranch, whose
brand is the Broad-arrow; and among them were the children for
whom the cub had been brought. The boss had no difficulty in getting
Jake to accept the dollar that the cub Coyote would have brought
in bounty-money, and his present was turned over to the children.
In answer to their question, "What is it?" a Mexican cow-hand,
present said it was a Coyotito--that is, a "little Coyote,"--and
this, afterward shortened to "Tito," became the captive's name.

[Illustration]

II

Tito was a pretty little creature, with woolly body, a puppy-like
expression, and a head that was singularly broad between the ears.

But, as a children's pet, she--for it proved to be a female--was
not a success. She was distant and distrustful. She ate her food
and seemed healthy, but never responded to friendly advances; never
[Illustration:
Coyotito, the Captive] even learned to come out of the box when
called.
Inorganic matter was perceived as anything but inert;
it was athrill under the action of multitudinous forces.

"A universal reaction seemed to bring metal, plant and animal under
a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same phenomena
of fatigue and depression, with possibilities of recovery and of
exaltation, as well as the permanent irresponsiveness associated
with death. Filled with awe at this stupendous generalization, it
was with great hope that I announced my results before the Royal
Society--results demonstrated by experiments. But the physiologists
present advised me to confine myself to physical investigations, in
which my success had been assured, rather than encroach on their
preserves. I had unwittingly strayed into the domain of an unfamiliar
caste system and so offended its etiquette.

"An unconscious theological bias was also present, which confounds
ignorance with faith. It is often forgotten that He who surrounded
us with this ever-evolving mystery of creation has also implanted
in us the desire to question and understand. Through many years
of miscomprehension, I came to know that the life of a devotee of
science is inevitably filled with unending struggle. It is for him
to cast his life as an ardent offering-regarding gain and loss,
success and failure, as one.

"In time the leading scientific societies of the world accepted my
theories and results, and recognized the importance of the Indian
contribution to science. {FN8-4} Can anything small or circumscribed
ever satisfy the mind of India? By a continuous living tradition,
and a vital power of rejuvenescence, this land has readjusted itself
through unnumbered transformations. Indians have always arisen who,
discarding the immediate and absorbing prize of the hour, have
sought for the realization of the highest ideals in life-not through
passive renunciation, but through active struggle. The weakling
who has refused the conflict, acquiring nothing, has had nothing
to renounce.  He alone who has striven and won can enrich the world
by bestowing the fruits of his victorious experience.

"The work already carried out in the Bose laboratory on the
response of matter, and the unexpected revelations in plant life,
have opened out very extended regions of inquiry in physics, in
physiology, in medicine, in agriculture, and even in psychology.
Problems hitherto regarded as insoluble have now been brought within
the sphere of experimental investigation.

"But high success is not to be obtained without rigid exactitude.
Hence the long battery of super-sensitive instruments and apparatus
of my design, which stand before you today in their cases in the
entrance hall. They tell you of the protracted efforts to get behind
the deceptive seeming into the reality that remains unseen, of the
continuous toil and persistence and resourcefulness called forth
to overcome human limitations. All creative scientists know that
the true laboratory is the mind, where behind illusions they uncover
the laws of truth.

"The lectures given here will not be mere repetitions of second-hand
knowledge. They will announce new discoveries, demonstrated for
the first time in these halls. Through regular publication of the
work of the Institute, these Indian contributions will reach the
whole world.  They will become public property. No patents will
ever be taken. The spirit of our national culture demands that we
should forever be free from the desecration of utilizing knowledge
only for personal gain.

"It is my further wish that the facilities of this Institute be
available, so far as possible, to workers from all countries. In
this I am attempting to carry on the traditions of my country. So
far back as twenty-five centuries, India welcomed to its ancient
universities, at Nalanda and Taxila, scholars from all parts of
the world.

"Although science is neither of the East nor of the West but rather
international in its universality, yet India is specially fitted to
make great contributions. {FN8-5} The burning Indian imagination,
which can extort new order out of a mass of apparently contradictory
facts, is held in check by the habit of concentration. This restraint
confers the power to hold the mind to the pursuit of truth with an
infinite patience."

Tears stood in my eyes at the scientist's concluding words. Is
"patience" not indeed a synonym of India, confounding Time and the
historians alike?

I visited the research center again, soon after the day of opening.
The great botanist, mindful of his promise, took me to his quiet
laboratory.

"I will attach the crescograph to this fern; the magnification is
tremendous. If a snail's crawl were enlarged in the same proportion,
the creature would appear to be traveling like an express train!"

My gaze was fixed eagerly on the screen which reflected the magnified
fern-shadow. Minute life-movements were now clearly perceptible;
the plant was growing very slowly before my fascinated eyes. The
scientist touched the tip of the fern with a small metal bar. The
developing pantomime came to an abrupt halt, resuming the eloquent
rhythms as soon as the rod was withdrawn.

"You saw how any slight outside interference is detrimental to the
sensitive tissues," Bose remarked. "Watch; I will now administer
chloroform, and then give an antidote."

The effect of the chloroform discontinued all growth; the antidote
was revivifying. The evolutionary gestures on the screen held me
more raptly than a "movie" plot. My companion (here in the role
of villain) thrust a sharp instrument through a part of the fern;
pain was indicated by spasmodic flutters. When he passed a razor
partially through the stem, the shadow was violently agitated, then
stilled itself with the final punctuation of death.

"By first chloroforming a huge tree, I achieved a successful
transplantation. Usually, such monarchs of the forest die very
quickly after being moved." Jagadis smiled happily as he recounted
the life-saving maneuver. "Graphs of my delicate apparatus have
proved that trees possess a circulatory system; their sap movements
correspond to the blood pressure of animal bodies. The ascent of
sap is not explicable on the mechanical grounds ordinarily advanced,
such as capillary attraction. The phenomenon has been solved through
the crescograph as the activity of living cells. Peristaltic waves
issue from a cylindrical tube which extends down a tree and serves
as an actual heart! The more deeply we perceive, the more striking
becomes the evidence that a uniform plan links every form in manifold
nature."

The great scientist pointed to another Bose instrument.

"I will show you experiments on a piece of tin. The life-force in
metals responds adversely or beneficially to stimuli. Ink markings
will register the various reactions."

Deeply engrossed, I watched the graph which recorded the characteristic
waves of atomic structure. When the professor applied chloroform
to the tin, the vibratory writings stopped. They recommenced as
the metal slowly regained its normal state. My companion dispensed
a poisonous chemical. Simultaneous with the quivering end of the
tin, the needle dramatically wrote on the chart a death-notice.

"Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel
used in scissors and machinery, are subject to fatigue, and regain
efficiency by periodic rest. The life-pulse in metals is seriously
harmed or even extinguished through the application of electric
currents or heavy pressure."

I looked around the room at the numerous inventions, eloquent
testimony of a tireless ingenuity.

"Sir, it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is
not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it
not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory
experiments to indicate the influence of various types of fertilizers
on plant growth?"

"You are right. Countless uses of Bose instruments will be made
by future generations. The scientist seldom knows contemporaneous
reward; it is enough to possess the joy of creative service."

With expressions of unreserved gratitude to the indefatigable sage,
I took my leave. "Can the astonishing fertility of his genius ever
be exhausted?" I thought.

No diminution came with the years. Inventing an intricate instrument,
the "Resonant Cardiograph," Bose then pursued extensive researches
on innumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia
of useful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is constructed with
an unerring accuracy by which a one-hundredth part of a second
is indicated on a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal
pulsations in plant, animal and human structure. The great botanist
predicted that use of his cardiograph will lead to vivisection on
plants instead of animals.

"Side by side recordings of the effects of a medicine given
simultaneously to a plant and an animal have shown astounding
unanimity in result," he pointed out. "Everything in man has been
foreshadowed in the plant. Experimentation on vegetation will
contribute to lessening of human suffering."

Years later Bose's pioneer plant findings were substantiated by other
scientists. Work done in 1938 at Columbia University was reported
by THE NEW YORK TIMES as follows:

It has been determined within the past few years that when the
nerves transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the
body, tiny electrical impulses are being generated. These impulses
have been measured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions
of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory
method had been found to study the passages of the impulses along
the nerve fibers in living animals or man because of the great
speed with which these impulses travel.

Drs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the
long single cells of the fresh-water plant nitella, used frequently
in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single
nerve fibers. Furthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being
excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in every way,
except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man.
The electrical nerve impulses in the plant were found to be much
slower than those in animals. This discovery was therefore seized
upon by the Columbia workers as a means for taking slow motion
pictures of the passage of the electrical impulses in nerves.

The nitella plant thus may become a sort of Rosetta stone for
deciphering the closely guarded secrets close to the very borderland
of mind and matter.

The poet Rabindranath Tagore was a stalwart friend of India's
idealistic scientist. To him, the sweet Bengali singer addressed
the following lines: {FN8-6}

  O Hermit, call thou in the authentic words
  Of that old hymn called SAMA; "Rise! Awake!"
  Call to the man who boasts his SHASTRIC lore
  From vain pedantic wranglings profitless,
  Call to that foolish braggart to come forth
  Out on the face of nature, this broad earth,
  Send forth this call unto thy scholar band;
  Together round thy sacrifice of fire
  Let them all gather. So may our India,
  Our ancient land unto herself return
  O once again return to steadfast work,
  To duty and devotion, to her trance
  Of earnest meditation; let her sit
  Once more unruffled, greedless, strifeless, pure,
  O once again upon her lofty seat
  And platform, teacher of all lands.

{FN8-1} "All science is transcendental or else passes away. Botany
is now acquiring the right theory-the avatars of Brahma will
presently be the textbooks of natural history."-EMERSON.

{FN8-2} From the Latin root, CRESCERE, to increase. For his
crescograph and other inventions, Bose was knighted in 1917.

{FN8-3} The lotus flower is an ancient divine symbol in India; its
unfolding petals suggest the expansion of the soul; the growth of
its pure beauty from the mud of its origin holds a benign spiritual
promise.

{FN8-4} "At present, only the sheerest accident brings India into
the purview of the American college student. Eight universities
(Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, Pennsylvania,
Chicago, and California) have chairs of Indology or Sanskrit,
but India is virtually unrepresented in departments of history,
philosophy, fine arts, political science, sociology, or any of
the other departments of intellectual experience in which, as we
have seen, India has made great contributions. . . . We believe,
consequently, that no department of study, particularly in the
humanities, in any major university can be fully equipped without
a properly trained specialist in the Indic phases of its discipline.
We believe, too, that every college which aims to prepare its
graduates for intelligent work in the world which is to be theirs
to live in, must have on its staff a scholar competent in the
civilization of India."-Extracts from an article by Professor W.
Norman Brown of the University of Pennsylvania which appeared in
the May, 1939, issue of the BULLETIN of the American Council of
Learned Societies, 907 15th St., Washington, D. C., 25 cents copy.
This issue (#28) contains over 100 pages of a "Basic Bibliography
for Indic Studies."

{FN8-5} The atomic structure of matter was well-known to the ancient
Hindus. One of the six systems of Indian philosophy is VAISESIKA,
from the Sanskrit root VISESAS, "atomic individuality." One of the
foremost VAISESIKA expounders was Aulukya, also called Kanada, "the
atom-eater," born about 2800 years ago.

In an article in EAST-WEST, April, 1934, a summary of VAISESIKA
scientific knowledge was given as follows: "Though the modern
'atomic theory' is generally considered a new advance of science,
it was brilliantly expounded long ago by Kanada, 'the atom-eater.'
The Sanskrit ANUS can be properly translated as 'atom' in the latter's
literal Greek sense of 'uncut' or indivisible. Other scientific
expositions of VAISESIKA treatises of the B.C. era include (1) the
movement of needles toward magnets, (2) the circulation of water
in plants, (3) AKASH or ether, inert and structureless, as a basis
for transmitting subtle forces, (4) the solar fire as the cause of
all other forms of heat, (5) heat as the cause of molecular change,
(6) the law of gravitation as caused by the quality that inheres in
earth-atoms to give them their attractive power or downward pull,
(7) the kinetic nature of all energy; causation as always rooted
in an expenditure of energy or a redistribution of motion, (8)
universal dissolution through the disintegration of atoms, (9)
the radiation of heat and light rays, infinitely small particles,
darting forth in all directions with inconceivable speed (the modern
'cosmic rays' theory), (10) the relativity of time and space.

"VAISESIKA assigned the origin of the world to atoms, eternal in
their nature, i.e., their ultimate peculiarities. These atoms were
regarded as possessing an incessant vibratory motion. . . . The
recent discovery that an atom is a miniature solar system would be
no news to the old VAISESIKA philosophers, who also reduced time to
its furthest mathematical concept by describing the smallest unit
of time (KALA) as the period taken by an atom to traverse its own
unit of space."

Manmohan Ghosh, in VISWA-BHARATI.


CHAPTER: 9

THE BLISSFUL DEVOTEE AND HIS COSMIC ROMANCE

"Little sir, please be seated. I am talking to my Divine Mother."

Silently I had entered the room in great awe. The angelic
appearance of Master Mahasaya fairly dazzled me. With silky white
beard and large lustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity.
His upraised chin and folded hands apprized me that my first visit
had disturbed him in the midst of his devotions.

His simple words of greeting produced the most violent effect my
nature had so far experienced. The bitter separation of my mother's
death I had thought the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at
separation from my Divine Mother was an indescribable torture of
the spirit. I fell moaning to the floor.

"Little sir, quiet yourself!" The saint was sympathetically
distressed.

Abandoned in some oceanic desolation, I clutched his feet as the
sole raft of my rescue.

"Holy sir, thy intercession! Ask Divine Mother if I find any favor
in Her sight!"

This promise is one not easily bestowed; the master was constrained
to silence.

Beyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that Master Mahasaya was in
intimate converse with the Universal Mother. It was deep humiliation
to realize that my eyes were blind to Her who even at this moment
was perceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly
gripping his feet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I besought
him again and again for his intervening grace.

"I will make your plea to the Beloved." The master's capitulation
came with a slow, compassionate smile.

What power in those few words, that my being should know release
from its stormy exile?

"Sir, remember your pledge! I shall return soon for Her message!"
Joyful anticipation rang in my voice that only a moment ago had
been sobbing in sorrow.

Descending the long stairway, I was overwhelmed by memories. This
house at 50 Amherst Street, now the residence of Master Mahasaya,
had once been my family home, scene of my mother's death. Here
my human heart had broken for the vanished mother; and here today
my spirit had been as though crucified by absence of the Divine
Mother. Hallowed walls, silent witness of my grievous hurts and
final healing!

My steps were eager as I returned to my Gurpar Road home. Seeking
the seclusion of my small attic, I remained in meditation until
ten o'clock. The darkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly
lit with a wondrous vision.

Haloed in splendor, the Divine Mother stood before me. Her face,
tenderly smiling, was beauty itself.

"Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!"

The celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared.

The sun on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of
decorum when I paid my second visit to Master Mahasaya. Climbing
the staircase in the house of poignant memories, I reached his
fourth-floor room. The knob of the closed door was wrapped around
with a cloth; a hint, I felt, that the saint desired privacy. As
I stood irresolutely on the landing, the door was opened by the
master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his holy feet. In a playful
mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the divine elation.

"Sir, I have come-very early, I confess!-for your message. Did the
Beloved Mother say anything about me?"

"Mischievous little sir!"

Not another remark would he make. Apparently my assumed gravity
was unimpressive.

"Why so mysterious, so evasive? Do saints never speak plainly?"
Perhaps I was a little provoked.

"Must you test me?" His calm eyes were full of understanding. "Could
I add a single word this morning to the assurance you received last
night at ten o'clock from the Beautiful Mother Herself?"

Master Mahasaya possessed control over the flood-gates of my soul:
again I plunged prostrate at his feet. But this time my tears welled
from a bliss, and not a pain, past bearing.

"Think you that your devotion did not touch the Infinite Mercy?
The Motherhood of God, that you have worshiped in forms both human
and divine, could never fail to answer your forsaken cry."

Who was this simple saint, whose least request to the Universal Spirit
met with sweet acquiescence? His role in the world was humble, as
befitted the greatest man of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst
Street house, Master Mahasaya {FN9-1} conducted a small high school
for boys. No words of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and
ferule maintained his discipline. Higher mathematics indeed were
taught in these modest classrooms, and a chemistry of love absent
from the textbooks. He spread his wisdom by spiritual contagion
rather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophisticated
passion for the Divine Mother, the saint no more demanded the
outward forms of respect than a child.

"I am not your guru; he shall come a little later," he told me.
"Through his guidance, your experiences of the Divine in terms of
love and devotion shall be translated into his terms of fathomless
wisdom."

Every late afternoon, I betook myself to Amherst Street. I
sought Master Mahasaya's divine cup, so full that its drops daily
overflowed on my being. Never before had I bowed in utter reverence;
now I felt it an immeasurable privilege even to tread the same
ground which Master Mahasaya sanctified.

"Sir, please wear this champak garland I have fashioned especially
for you." I arrived one evening, holding my chain of flowers. But
shyly he drew away, repeatedly refusing the honor. Perceiving my
hurt, he finally smiled consent.

"Since we are both devotees of the Mother, you may put the garland
on this bodily temple, as offering to Her who dwells within." His
vast nature lacked space in which any egotistical consideration
could gain foothold.

[Illustration: Two Brothers of Therese Neumann, I stand with them
in Konnersreuth, Bavaria.--see nbrothers.jpg]

[Illustration: Master Mahasaya, Ever engrossed in his blissful
cosmic romance.--see mmahasaya.jpg]

"Let us go tomorrow to the Dakshineswar Temple, forever hallowed
by my guru." Master Mahasaya was a disciple of a Christlike master,
Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa.

The four-mile journey on the following morning was taken by boat
on the Ganges. We entered the nine-domed Temple of Kali, where the
figures of the Divine Mother and Shiva rest on a burnished silver
lotus, its thousand petals meticulously chiseled. Master Mahasaya
beamed in enchantment. He was engaged in his inexhaustible romance
with the Beloved. As he chanted Her name, my enraptured heart seemed
shattered into a thousand pieces.

We strolled later through the sacred precincts, halting in a
tamarisk grove. The manna characteristically exuded by this tree
was symbolic of the heavenly food Master Mahasaya was bestowing.
His divine invocations continued. I sat rigidly motionless on the
grass amid the pink feathery tamarisk flowers. Temporarily absent
from the body, I soared in a supernal visit.

This was the first of many pilgrimages to Dakshineswar with the holy
teacher. From him I learned the sweetness of God in the aspect of
Mother, or Divine Mercy. The childlike saint found little appeal in
the Father aspect, or Divine Justice. Stern, exacting, mathematical
judgment was alien to his gentle nature.

"He can serve as an earthly prototype for the very angels of
heaven!" I thought fondly, watching him one day at his prayers.
Without a breath of censure or criticism, he surveyed the world
with eyes long familiar with the Primal Purity. His body, mind,
speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his soul's
simplicity.

"My Master told me so." Shrinking from personal assertion, the
saint ended any sage counsel with this invariable tribute. So deep
was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that Master Mahasaya no longer
considered his thoughts as his own.

Hand in hand, the saint and I walked one evening on the block of his
school. My joy was dimmed by the arrival of a conceited acquaintance
who burdened us with a lengthy discourse.

"I see this man doesn't please you." The saint's whisper to me was
unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his own monologue. "I have
spoken to Divine Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament.
As soon as we get to yonder red house, She has promised to remind
him of more urgent business."

My eyes were glued to the site of salvation. Reaching its red gate,
the man unaccountably turned and departed, neither finishing his
sentence nor saying good-by. The assaulted air was comforted with
peace.

Another day found me walking alone near the Howrah railway station.
I stood for a moment by a temple, silently criticizing a small group
of men with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant.

"How undevotionally they use the Lord's divine name in mechanical
repetition," I reflected. My gaze was astonished by the rapid
approach of Master Mahasaya. "Sir, how come you here?"

The saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. "Isn't it
true, little sir, that the Beloved's name sounds sweet from all
lips, ignorant or wise?" He passed his arm around me affectionately;
I found myself carried on his magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.

"Would you like to see some bioscopes?" This question one afternoon
from Master Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then used in India
to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in
any circumstances. A brisk walk brought us to the garden fronting
Calcutta University. My companion indicated a bench near the GOLDIGHI
or pond.

"Let us sit here for a few minutes. My Master always asked me
to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of water. Here its placidity
reminds us of the vast calmness of God. As all things can be
reflected in water, so the whole universe is mirrored in the lake
of the Cosmic Mind. So my GURUDEVA often said."

Soon we entered a university hall where a lecture was in progress.
It proved abysmally dull, though varied occasionally by lantern
slide illustrations, equally uninteresting.

"So this is the kind of bioscope the master wanted me to see!" My
thought was impatient, yet I would not hurt the saint by revealing
boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.

"I see, little sir, that you don't like this bioscope. I have
mentioned it to Divine Mother; She is in full sympathy with us
both.  She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and
won't be relit until we have a chance to leave the room."

As his whisper ended, the hall was plunged into darkness. The
professor's strident voice was stilled in astonishment, then remarked,
"The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective." By
this time, Master Mahasaya and I were safely across the threshold.
Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our
martyrdom had again become illuminated.

"Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, {FN9-2} but I
think you will like a different one." The saint and I were standing
on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently
slapped my chest over the heart.

A transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern "talkies" become
inaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of
order, so the Divine Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the
earthly bustle. The pedestrians as well as the passing trolley cars,
automobiles, bullock carts, and iron-wheeled hackney carriages were
all in noiseless transit. As though possessing an omnipresent eye,
I beheld the scenes which were behind me, and to each side, as
easily as those in front. The whole spectacle of activity in that
small section of Calcutta passed before me without a sound. Like
a glow of fire dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a mellow
luminescence permeated the panoramic view.

My own body seemed nothing more than one of the many shadows,
though it was motionless, while the others flitted mutely to and
fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; though
they had looked directly at me, it was without recognition.

The unique pantomime brought me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank
deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received another
soft blow from Master Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the world burst
upon my unwilling ears. I staggered, as though harshly awakened
from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my
reach.

"Little sir, I see you found the second bioscope to your liking."
The saint was smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground
before him. "You can't do that to me now; you know God is in your
temple also! I won't let Divine Mother touch my feet through your
hands!"

If anyone observed the unpretentious master and myself as we walked
away from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected
us of intoxication. I felt that the falling shades of evening
were sympathetically drunk with God. When darkness recovered from
its nightly swoon, I faced the new morning bereft of my ecstatic
mood. But ever enshrined in memory is the seraphic son of Divine
Mother-Master Mahasaya!

Trying with poor words to do justice to his benignity, I wonder if
Master Mahasaya, and others among the deep-visioned saints whose
paths crossed mine, knew that years later, in a Western land,
I would be writing about their lives as divine devotees. Their
foreknowledge would not surprise me nor, I hope, my readers, who
have come thus far with me.

{FN9-1} These are respectful titles by which he was customarily
addressed. His name was Mahendra Nath Gupta; he signed his literary
works simply "M."

{FN9-2} The Oxford English Dictionary gives, as rare, this definition
of BIOSCOPE: A view of life; that which gives such a view.

Master Mahasaya's choice of a word was, then, peculiarly justified.


CHAPTER: 10

I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR

"Faith in God can produce any miracle except one-passing an
examination without study." Distastefully I closed the book I had
picked up in an idle moment.

"The writer's exception shows his complete lack of faith," I thought.
"Poor chap, he has great respect for the midnight oil!"

My promise to Father had been that I would complete my high school
studies. I cannot pretend to diligence. The passing months found me
less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the
Calcutta bathing GHATS. The adjoining crematory grounds, especially
gruesome at night, are considered highly attractive by the yogi.
He who would find the Deathless Essence must not be dismayed by a
few unadorned skulls. Human inadequacy becomes clear in the gloomy
abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnight vigils were thus of a
different nature from the scholar's.

The week of final examinations at the Hindu High School was fast
approaching. This interrogatory period, like the sepulchral haunts,
inspires a well-known terror. My mind was nevertheless at peace.
Braving the ghouls, I was exhuming a knowledge not found in lecture
halls. But it lacked the art of Swami Pranabananda, who easily
appeared in two places at one time. My educational dilemma was
plainly a matter for the Infinite Ingenuity. This was my reasoning,
though to many it seems illogic. The devotee's irrationality springs
from a thousand inexplicable demonstrations of God's instancy in
trouble.

"Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glimpse of you these days!" A
classmate accosted me one afternoon on Gurpar Road.

"Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at school has actually placed me
there in a decidedly awkward position." I unburdened myself under
his friendly gaze.

Nantu, who was a brilliant student, laughed heartily; my predicament
was not without a comic aspect.

"You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to
me to help you!"

The simple words conveyed divine promise to my ears; with alacrity
I visited my friend's home. He kindly outlined the solutions to
various problems he considered likely to be set by the instructors.

"These questions are the bait which will catch many trusting boys
in the examination trap. Remember my answers, and you will escape
without injury."

The night was far gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned
erudition, I devoutly prayed it would remain for the next few
critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but,
under press of time, had forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently
I reminded God of the oversight.

I set out on a short walk the next morning, assimilating my new
knowledge to the rhythm of swinging footsteps. As I took a short
cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose
printed sheets. A triumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse.
I sought out a pundit for aid in my stumbling interpretation. His
rich voice filled the air with the edgeless, honeyed beauty of the
ancient tongue. {FN10-1}

"These exceptional stanzas cannot possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit
test." The scholar dismissed them skeptically.

But familiarity with that particular poem enabled me on the following
day to pass the Sanskrit examination. Through the discerning help
Nantu had given, I also attained the minimum grade for success in
all my other subjects.

Father was pleased that I had kept my word and concluded my secondary
school course. My gratitude sped to the Lord, whose sole guidance
I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unhabitual route
of the debris-filled lot. Playfully He had given a dual expression
to His timely design for my rescue.

I came across the discarded book whose author had denied God
precedence in the examination halls. I could not restrain a chuckle
at my own silent comment:

"It would only add to this fellow's confusion, if I were to tell
him that divine meditation among the cadavers is a short cut to a
high school diploma!"

In my new dignity, I was now openly planning to leave home. Together
with a young friend, Jitendra Mazumdar, {FN10-2} I decided to join a
Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its spiritual discipline.

A desolation fell over me one morning at thought of separation from
my family. Since Mother's death, my affection had grown especially
tender for my two younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed
to my retreat, the little attic which had witnessed so many scenes
in my turbulent SADHANA. {FN10-3} After a two-hour flood of tears,
I felt singularly transformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All
attachment {FN10-4} disappeared; my resolution to seek God as the
Friend of friends set like granite within me. I quickly completed
my travel preparations.

"I make one last plea." Father was distressed as I stood before him
for final blessing. "Do not forsake me and your grieving brothers
and sisters."

"Revered Father, how can I tell my love for you! But even greater
is my love for the Heavenly Father, who has given me the gift of
a perfect father on earth. Let me go, that I someday return with
a more divine understanding."

With reluctant parental consent, I set out to join Jitendra, already
in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival the young head swami,
Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien,
he impressed me favorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure.

I was pleased that my new home possessed an attic, where I managed
to spend the dawn and morning hours. The ashram members, knowing
little of meditation practices, thought I should employ my whole
time in organizational duties. They gave me praise for my afternoon
work in their office.

"Don't try to catch God so soon!" This ridicule from a fellow
resident accompanied one of my early departures toward the attic. I
went to Dyananda, busy in his small sanctum overlooking the Ganges.

"Swamiji, {FN10-5} I don't understand what is required of me here.
I am seeking direct perception of God. Without Him, I cannot be
satisfied with affiliation or creed or performance of good works."

The orange-robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging
a mock rebuke, he admonished a few near-by disciples. "Don't bother
Mukunda. He will learn our ways."

I politely concealed my doubt. The students left the room, not overly
bent with their chastisement. Dyananda had further words for me.

"Mukunda, I see your father is regularly sending you money. Please
return it to him; you require none here. A second injunction for
your discipline concerns food. Even when you feel hunger, don't
mention it."

Whether famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry,
I knew only too well. The invariable hour for the first hermitage
meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a
large breakfast at nine o'clock.

The three-hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the
Calcutta years when I could rebuke the cook for a ten-minute delay.
Now I tried to control my appetite; one day I undertook a twenty-four
hour fast. With double zest I awaited the following midday.

"Dyanandaji's train is late; we are not going to eat until he
arrives." Jitendra brought me this devastating news. As gesture
of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for two weeks, many
delicacies were in readiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air.
Nothing else offering, what else could be swallowed except pride
over yesterday's achievement of a fast?

"Lord hasten the train!" The Heavenly Provider, I thought, was hardly
included in the interdiction with which Dyananda had silenced me.
Divine Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered
the hours. Darkness was descending as our leader entered the door.
My greeting was one of unfeigned joy.

"Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food."
Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill omen.

I was in near-collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation,
protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of famine victims
passed wraithlike before me.

"The next Benares death from starvation is due at once in this
hermitage," I thought. Impending doom averted at nine o'clock.
Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of life's
perfect hours.

Intense absorption yet permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate
absent-mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures.

"Swamiji, weren't you hungry?" Happily surfeited, I was alone with
the leader in his study.

"O yes! I have spent the last four days without food or drink.
I never eat on trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of
worldly people. Strictly I observe the SHASTRIC {FN10-6} rules for
monks of my particular order.

"Certain problems of our organizational work lie on my mind.
Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. What's the hurry? Tomorrow
I'll make it a point to have a proper meal." He laughed merrily.

Shame spread within me like a suffocation. But the past day of my
torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark.

"Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never
asked for food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death."

"Die then!" This alarming counsel split the air. "Die if you must
Mukunda! Never admit that you live by the power of food and not by
the power of God! He who has created every form of nourishment, He
who has bestowed appetite, will certainly see that His devotee is
sustained!  Do not imagine that rice maintains you, or that money
or men support you! Could they aid if the Lord withdraws your
life-breath? They are His indirect instruments merely. Is it by
any skill of yours that food digests in your stomach? Use the sword
of your discrimination, Mukunda! Cut through the chains of agency
and perceive the Single Cause!"

I found his incisive words entering some deep marrow. Gone was
an age-old delusion by which bodily imperatives outwit the soul.
There and then I tasted the Spirit's all-sufficiency. In how many
strange cities, in my later life of ceaseless travel, did occasion
arise to prove the serviceability of this lesson in a Benares
hermitage!

The sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the
SADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to me by Mother. Guarding it for
years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew
my joy in the talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked
box.  The sealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet was gone.
Mournfully I tore open its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It
had vanished, in accordance with the SADHU'S prediction, into the
ether whence he had summoned it.

My relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The
household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict
adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left
home and all worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on
all sides.

Torn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved
to pray until answer was vouchsafed.

"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions,
or through a guru sent by Thee!"

The passing hours found my sobbing pleas without response. Suddenly
I felt lifted as though bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.

"Thy Master cometh today!" A divine womanly voice came from everywhere
and nowhere.

This supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite
locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the
downstairs kitchen.

"Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand."

Another day I might have replied impatiently; now I wiped
my tear-swollen face and meekly obeyed the summons. Together Habu
and I set out for a distant market place in the Bengali section of
Benares. The ungentle Indian sun was not yet at zenith as we made
our purchases in the bazaars. We pushed our way through the colorful
medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified
Brahmins, and the ubiquitous holy bulls. Passing an inconspicuous
lane, I turned my head and surveyed the narrow length.

A Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at
the end of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed;
my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.

"You are confusing this wandering monk with someone known to you,"
I thought. "Dreamer, walk on."

After ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As though
turned to stone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously
I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite
direction; again the curious weight oppressed me.

"The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!" With this thought,
I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had been observing
my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.

"What ails you? Are you crazy?"

My tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away.

Retracing my steps as though wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane.
My quick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my
direction. A few eager steps and I was at his feet.

"Gurudeva!" {FN10-7} The divine face was none other than he of my
thousand visions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine head with pointed
beard and flowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal
reveries, holding a promise I had not fully understood.

"O my own, you have come to me!" My guru uttered the words again
and again in Bengali, his voice tremulous with joy. "How many years
I have waited for you!"

We entered a oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest
superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of
master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed
that my guru knew God, and would lead me to Him. The obscuration
of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories.
Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes.
This was not the first sun to find me at these holy feet!

My hand in his, my guru led me to his temporary residence in the
Rana Mahal section of the city. His athletic figure moved with firm
tread.  Tall, erect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active
and vigorous as a young man. His dark eyes were large, beautiful with
plumbless wisdom. Slightly curly hair softened a face of striking
power.  Strength mingled subtly with gentleness.

As we made our way to the stone balcony of a house overlooking the
Ganges, he said affectionately:

"I will give you my hermitages and all I possess."

"Sir, I come for wisdom and God-contact. Those are your treasure-troves
I am after!"

The swift Indian twilight had dropped its half-curtain before my
master spoke again. His eyes held unfathomable tenderness.

"I give you my unconditional love."

Precious words! A quarter-century elapsed before I had another
auricular proof of his love. His lips were strange to ardor; silence
became his oceanic heart.

"Will you give me the same unconditional love?" He gazed at me with
childlike trust.

"I will love you eternally, Gurudeva!"

"Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions.
Divine love is without condition, without boundary, without change.
The flux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch
of pure love." He added humbly, "If ever you find me falling from
a state of God-realization, please promise to put my head on your
lap and help to bring me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship."

He rose then in the gathering darkness and guided me to an inner
room.  As we ate mangoes and almond sweetmeats, he unobtrusively
wove into his conversation an intimate knowledge of my nature. I
was awe-struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended
with an innate humility.

"Do not grieve for your amulet. It has served its purpose." Like
a divine mirror, my guru apparently had caught a reflection of my
whole life.

"The living reality of your presence, Master, is joy beyond any
symbol."

"It is time for a change, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated
in the hermitage."

I had made no references to my life; they now seemed superfluous!
By his natural, unemphatic manner, I understood that he wished no
astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance.

"You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your
love of humanity?"

His suggestion dismayed me. My family was predicting my return,
though I had been unresponsive to many pleas by letter. "Let the
young bird fly in the metaphysical skies," Ananta had remarked.
"His wings will tire in the heavy atmosphere. We shall yet see him
swoop toward home, fold his pinions, and humbly rest in our family
nest." This discouraging simile fresh in my mind, I was determined
to do no "swooping" in the direction of Calcutta.

"Sir, I am not returning home. But I will follow you anywhere.
Please give me your address, and your name."

"Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. My chief hermitage is in Serampore, on
Rai Ghat Lane. I am visiting my mother here for only a few days."

I wondered at God's intricate play with His devotees. Serampore is
but twelve miles from Calcutta, yet in those regions I had never
caught a glimpse of my guru. We had had to travel for our meeting
to the ancient city of Kasi (Benares), hallowed by memories of
Lahiri Mahasaya. Here too the feet of Buddha, Shankaracharya and
other Yogi--Christs had blessed the soil.

"You will come to me in four weeks." For the first time, Sri
Yukteswar's voice was stern. "Now I have told my eternal affection,
and have shown my happiness at finding you-that is why you disregard
my request. The next time we meet, you will have to reawaken my
interest: I won't accept you as a disciple easily. There must be
complete surrender by obedience to my strict training."

I remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my
difficulty.

"Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?"

"I will not return."

"You will return in thirty days."

"Never." They gave us the names, which I hope to describe their names
in the end of this most imperfect discours, at least those that I can
remember. Among others they told us of a nation called Nadoneceronon,
which is very strong, with whome they weare in warres with, & another
wandering nation, living onely uppon what they could come by.
Their dwelling was on the side of the salt watter in summer time,
& in the land in the winter time, for it's cold in their country.

They calle themselves Christinos, & their confederats from all
times, by reason of their speech, which is the same, & often
have joyned together & have had companys of souldiers to warre
against that great nation.

We desired not to goe to the North till we had made a discovery
in the South, being desirous to know what they did.
They told us if we would goe with them to the great lake of the
stinkings, the time was come of their trafick, which was of as
many knives as they could gett from the french nation, because of
their dwellings, which was att the coming in of a lake called
Superior, but since the destructions of many neighboring nations
they retired themselves to the height of the lake.

We knewed those people well. We went to them almost yearly, and
the company that came up with us weare of the said nation, but
never could tell punctually where they lived because they make the
barre of the Christinos from whence they have the Castors that they
bring to the french.

This place is 600 leagues off, by reason of the circuit that we must
doe.

The hurrons & the Octanacks, from whence we came last, furnishes
them also, & comes to the furthest part of the lake of the stinkings,
there to have light earthen pots, and girdles made of goat's hairs,
& small shells that grow art the sea side, with which they trim
their cloath made of skin.

We finding this opportunity would not lett it slippe, but made
guifts, telling that the other nation would stand in feare of them
because of us.

We flattered them, saying none would dare to give them the least
wrong, in so much that many of the Octanacks that weare present
to make the same voyage. I can assure you I liked noe country as
I have that wherein we wintered; ffor whatever a man could desire
was to be had in great plenty; viz. staggs, fishes in abundance,
& all sort of meat, corne enough.

Those of the 2 nations would not come with us, but turned back to
their nation.

We neverthelesse put ourselves in hazard, for our curiosity, of
stay 2 or 3 years among that nation.

We ventured, for that we understand some of their idiome & trusted
to that.

We embarked ourselves on the delightfullest lake of the world. I tooke
notice of their Cottages & of the journeys of our navigation, for
because that the country was so pleasant, so beautifull & fruitfull
that it grieved me to see that the world could not discover such
inticing countrys to live in.

This I say because that the Europeans fight for a rock in the sea
against one another, or for a sterill land and horrid country,
that the people sent heere or there by the changement of the aire
ingenders sicknesse and dies thereof.

Contrarywise those kingdoms are so delicious & under so temperat
a climat, plentifull of all things, the earth bringing foorth its
fruit twice a yeare, the people live long & lusty & wise in
their way. What conquest would that bee att litle or no cost;
what laborinth of pleasure should millions of people have, instead
that millions complaine of misery & poverty! What should not men
reape out of the love of God in converting the souls heere, is
more to be gained to heaven then what is by differences of nothing
there, should not be so many dangers committed under the pretence
of religion! Why so many thoesoever are hid from us by our owne
faults, by our negligence, covetousnesse, & unbeliefe.

It's true, I confesse, that the accesse is difficult, but must say
that we are like the Cockscombs of Paris, when first they
begin to have wings, imagining that the larks will fall in their
mouths roasted; but we ought [to remember] that vertue is not
acquired without labour & taking great paines.

We meet with severall nations, all sedentary, amazed to see us, &
weare very civil.

The further we sejourned the delightfuller the land was to us.

I can say that [in] my lifetime I never saw a more incomparable
country, for all I have ben in Italy; yett Italy comes short of it,
as I think, when it was inhabited, & now forsaken of the wildmen.

Being about the great sea, we conversed with people that dwelleth
about the salt water, [Footnote:
"That dwelleth about the salt water;" namely, Hudson's Bay.] who
tould us that they saw some great white thing sometimes uppon the
water, & came towards the shore, & men in the top of it, and made
a noise like a company of swans; which made me believe that they
weare mistaken, for I could not imagine what it could be, except
the Spaniard; & the reason is that we found a barill broken as they
use in Spaine.

Those people have their haires long.
Life has shielded you thus far! What a plight
if you were forced to look to the Invisible Hand for your food and
shelter!  You would soon be begging on the streets!"

"Never! I would not put faith in passers-by rather than God! He can
devise for His devotee a thousand resources besides the begging-bowl!"

"More rhetoric! Suppose I suggest that your vaunted philosophy be
put to a test in this tangible world?"


"I would agree! Do you confine God to a speculative world?"

"We shall see; today you shall have opportunity either to enlarge
or to confirm my own views!" Ananta paused for a dramatic moment;
then spoke slowly and seriously.

"I propose that I send you and your fellow disciple Jitendra this
morning to the near-by city of Brindaban. You must not take a
single rupee; you must not beg, either for food or money; you must
not reveal your predicament to anyone; you must not go without your
meals; and you must not be stranded in Brindaban. If you return
to my bungalow here before twelve o'clock tonight, without having
broken any rule of the test, I shall be the most astonished man in
Agra!"

"I accept the challenge." No hesitation was in my words or in
my heart. Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Beneficence:
my healing of deadly cholera through appeal to Lahiri Mahasaya's
picture; the playful gift of the two kites on the Lahore roof with
Uma; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement; the decisive
message through the unknown Benares SADHU outside the compound of
the pundit's home; the vision of Divine Mother and Her majestic
words of love; Her swift heed through Master Mahasaya to my trifling
embarrassments; the last-minute guidance which materialized my
high school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living Master from
the mist of lifelong dreams.  Never could I admit my "philosophy"
unequal to any tussle on the world's harsh proving ground!

"Your willingness does you credit. I'll escort you to the train
at once." Ananta turned to the openmouthed Jitendra. "You must go
along as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!"

A half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way
tickets for our impromptu trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner
of the station, to a search of our persons. Ananta was quickly
satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple DHOTIS
{FN11-3} concealed nothing more than was necessary.

As faith invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke
protestingly. "Ananta, give me one or two rupees as a safeguard.
Then I can telegraph you in case of misfortune."

"Jitendra!" My ejaculation was sharply reproachful. "I will not
proceed with the test if you take any money as final security."

"There is something reassuring about the clink of coins." Jitendra
said no more as I regarded him sternly.

"Mukunda, I am not heartless." A hint of humility had crept into
Ananta's voice. It may be that his conscience was smiting him;
perhaps for sending two insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps
for his own religious skepticism. "If by any chance or grace you
pass successfully through the Brindaban ordeal, I shall ask you to
initiate me as your disciple."

This promise had a certain irregularity, in keeping with the
unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an Indian family
seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience
second only to a father. But no time remained for my comment; our
train was at point of departure.

Jitendra maintained a lugubrious silence as our train covered the
miles. Finally he bestirred himself; leaning over, he pinched me
painfully at an awkward spot.

"I see no sign that God is going to supply our next meal!"

"Be quiet, doubting Thomas; the Lord is working with us."

"Can you also arrange that He hurry? Already I am famished merely
at the prospect before us. I left Benares to view the Taj's mausoleum,
not to enter my own!"

"Cheer up, Jitendra! Are we not to have our first glimpse of the
sacred wonders of Brindaban? {FN11-4} I am in deep joy at thought
of treading the ground hallowed by feet of Lord Krishna."

The door of our compartment opened; two men seated themselves. The
next train stop would be the last.

"Young lads, do you have friends in Brindaban?" The stranger opposite
me was taking a surprising interest.

"None of your business!" Rudely I averted my gaze.

"You are probably flying away from your families under the enchantment
of the Stealer of Hearts. {FN11-5} I am of devotional temperament
myself. I will make it my positive duty to see that you receive
food, and shelter from this overpowering heat."

"No, sir, let us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in
judging us to be truants from home."

No further conversation ensued; the train came to a halt. As Jitendra
and I descended to the platform, our chance companions linked arms
with us and summoned a horse cab.

We alit before a stately hermitage, set amidst the evergreen trees
of well-kept grounds. Our benefactors were evidently known here; a
smiling lad led us without comment to a parlor. We were soon joined
by an elderly woman of dignified bearing.

"Gauri Ma, the princes could not come." One of the men addressed
the ashram hostess. "At the last moment their plans went awry; they
send deep regrets. But we have brought two other guests. As soon
as we met on the train, I felt drawn to them as devotees of Lord
Krishna."

on the "penniless test" at Brindaban; Lalit-da, my cousin; Swami

Mountains near Ranikhet in the Himalayas. A grandson of Lahiri
Mahasaya, Ananda Mohan Lahiri (second from right, in white), and
three other devotees are visiting the sacred spot.--see cave.jpg]

"Good-by, young friends." Our two acquaintances walked to the door.
"We shall meet again, if God be willing."

"You are welcome here." Gauri Ma smiled in motherly fashion on her
two unexpected charges. "You could not have come on a better day.
I was expecting two royal patrons of this hermitage. What a shame
if my cooking had found none to appreciate it!"

These appetizing words had disastrous effect on Jitendra: he burst
into tears. The "prospect" he had feared in Brindaban was turning
out as royal entertainment; his sudden mental adjustment proved
too much for him. Our hostess looked at him with curiosity, but
without remark; perhaps she was familiar with adolescent quirks.

Lunch was announced; Gauri Ma led the way to a dining patio, spicy
with savory odors. She vanished into an adjoining kitchen.

I had been premeditating this moment. Selecting the appropriate
spot on Jitendra's anatomy, I administered a pinch as resounding
as the one he had given me on the train.

"Doubting Thomas, the Lord works-in a hurry, too!"

The hostess reentered with a PUNKHA. She steadily fanned us in the
Oriental fashion as we squatted on ornate blanket-seats. Ashram
disciples passed to and fro with some thirty courses. Rather than
"meal," the description can only be "sumptuous repast." Since
arriving on this planet, Jitendra and I had never before tasted
such delicacies.

"Dishes fit for princes indeed, Honored Mother! What your royal
patrons could have found more urgent than attending this banquet,
I cannot imagine! You have given us a memory for a lifetime!"

Silenced as we were by Ananta's requirement, we could not explain
to the gracious lady that our thanks held a double significance.
Our sincerity at least was patent. We departed with her blessing
and an attractive invitation to revisit the hermitage.

The heat outdoors was merciless. My friend and I made for the
shelter of a lordly cadamba tree at the ashram gate. Sharp words
followed; once again Jitendra was beset with misgivings.

"A fine mess you have got me into! Our luncheon was only accidental
good fortune! How can we see the sights of this city, without a
single pice between us? And how on earth are you going to take me
back to Ananta's?"

"You forget God quickly, now that your stomach is filled." My words,
not bitter, were accusatory. How short is human memory for divine
favors! No man lives who has not seen certain of his prayers granted.

"I am not likely to forget my folly in venturing out with a madcap
like you!"

"Be quiet, Jitendra! The same Lord who fed us will show us Brindaban,
and return us to Agra."

A slight young man of pleasing countenance approached at rapid
pace.  Halting under our tree, he bowed before me.

"Dear friend, you and your companion must be strangers here. Permit
me to be your host and guide."

It is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendra's face
was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer.

"You are surely not banishing me?" The stranger's alarm would have
been comic in any other circumstances.

"Why not?"

"You are my guru." His eyes sought mine trustfully. "During my
midday devotions, the blessed Lord Krishna appeared in a vision.
He showed me two forsaken figures under this very tree. One face
was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation! What joy
if you accept my humble services!"

"I too am glad you have found me. Neither God nor man has forsaken
us!" Though I was motionless, smiling at the eager face before me,
an inward obeisance cast me at the Divine Feet.

"Dear friends, will you not honor my home for a visit?"

"You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests
of my brother in Agra."

"At least give me memories of touring Brindaban with you."

I gladly consented. The young man, who said his name was Pratap
Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple
and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our
temple devotions.

"Excuse me while I get SANDESH." {FN11-6} Pratap entered a shop
near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the
wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend
was absent for some time, but finally returned with gifts of many
sweetmeats.

"Please allow me to gain this religious merit." Pratap smiled
pleadingly as he held out a bundle of rupee notes and two tickets,
just purchased, to Agra.

The reverence of my acceptance was for the Invisible Hand. Scoffed
at by Ananta, had Its bounty not far exceeded necessity?

We sought out a secluded spot near the station.

"Pratap, I will instruct you in the KRIYA of Lahiri Mahasaya, the
greatest yogi of modern times. His technique will be your guru."

The initiation was concluded in a half hour. "KRIYA is your CHINTAMANI,"
{FN11-7} I told the new student. "The technique, which as you see
is simple, embodies the art of quickening man's spiritual evolution.
Hindu scriptures teach that the incarnating ego requires a million
years to obtain liberation from MAYA. This natural period is
greatly shortened through KRIYA YOGA. Just as Jagadis Chandra Bose
has demonstrated that plant growth can be accelerated far beyond
its normal rate, so man's psychological development can be also
speeded by an inner science. Be faithful in your practice; you will
approach the Guru of all gurus."

"I am transported to find this yogic key, long sought!" Pratap
spoke thoughtfully. "Its unshackling effect on my sensory bonds
will free me for higher spheres. The vision today of Lord Krishna
could only mean my highest good."

We sat awhile in silent understanding, then walked slowly to the
station. Joy was within me as I boarded the train, but this was
Jitendra's day for tears. My affectionate farewell to Pratap had
been punctuated by stifled sobs from both my companions. The journey
once more found Jitendra in a welter of grief. Not for himself this
time, but against himself.

"How shallow my trust! My heart has been stone! Never in future
shall I doubt God's protection!"

Midnight was approaching. The two "Cinderellas," sent forth
penniless, entered Ananta's bedroom. His face, as he had promised,
was a study in astonishment. Silently I showered the table with
rupees.

"Jitendra, the truth!" Ananta's tone was jocular. "Has not this
youngster been staging a holdup?"

But as the tale was unfolded, my brother turned sober, then solemn.

"The law of demand and supply reaches into subtler realms than I
had supposed." Ananta spoke with a spiritual enthusiasm never before
noticeable. "I understand for the first time your indifference to
the vaults and vulgar accumulations of the world."

Late as it was, my brother insisted that he receive DIKSHA {FN11-8}
into KRIYA YOGA. The "guru" Mukunda had to shoulder the responsibility
of two unsought disciples in one day.

Breakfast the following morning was eaten in a harmony absent the
day before. I smiled at Jitendra.

"You shall not be cheated of the Taj. Let us view it before starting
for Serampore."

Bidding farewell to Ananta, my friend and I were soon before the
glory of Agra, the Taj Mahal. White marble dazzling in the sun,
it stands a vision of pure symmetry. The perfect setting is dark
cypress, glossy lawn, and tranquil lagoon. The interior is exquisite
with lacelike carvings inlaid with semiprecious stones. Delicate
wreaths and scrolls emerge intricately from marbles, brown and
violet. Illumination from the dome falls on the cenotaphs of Emperor
Shah-Jahan and Mumtaz Mahall, queen of his realm and his heart.

Enough of sight-seeing! I was longing for my guru. Jitendra and I
were shortly traveling south by train toward Bengal.

"Mukunda, I have not seen my family in months. I have changed my
mind; perhaps later I shall visit your master in Serampore."

My friend, who may mildly be described as vacillating in temperament,
left me in Calcutta. By local train I soon reached Serampore, twelve
miles to the north.

A throb of wonderment stole over me as I realized that twenty-eight
days had elapsed since the Benares meeting with my guru. "You will
come to me in four weeks!" Here I was, heart pounding, standing
within his courtyard on quiet Rai Ghat Lane. I entered for the first
time the hermitage where I was to spend the best part of the next
ten years with India's JYANAVATAR, "incarnation of wisdom."

CHAPTER: 12

YEARS IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE

"You have come." Sri Yukteswar greeted me from a tiger skin on the
floor of a balconied sitting room. His voice was cold, his manner
unemotional.

"Yes, dear Master, I am here to follow you." Kneeling, I touched
his feet.

"How can that be? You ignore my wishes."

"No longer, Guruji! Your wish shall be my law!"

"That is better! Now I can assume responsibility for your life."

"I willingly transfer the burden, Master."

"My first request, then, is that you return home to your family.
I want you to enter college in Calcutta. Your education should be
continued."

"Very well, sir." I hid my consternation. Would importunate books
pursue me down the years? First Father, now Sri Yukteswar!


"Someday you will go to the West. Its people will lend ears more
receptive to India's ancient wisdom if the strange Hindu teacher
has a university degree."

"You know best, Guruji." My gloom departed. The reference to the
West I found puzzling, remote; but my opportunity to please Master
by obedience was vitally immediate.

"You will be near in Calcutta; come here whenever you find time."

"Every day if possible, Master! Gratefully I accept your authority
in every detail of my life-on one condition."

"Yes?"

"That you promise to reveal God to me!"

An hour-long verbal tussle ensued. A master's word cannot be
falsified; it is not lightly given. The implications in the pledge
open out vast metaphysical vistas. A guru must be on intimate
terms indeed with the Creator before he can obligate Him to appear!
I sensed Sri Yukteswar's divine unity, and was determined, as his
disciple, to press my advantage.

"You are of exacting disposition!" Then Master's consent rang out
with compassionate finality:

"Let your wish be my wish."

Lifelong shadow lifted from my heart; the vague search, hither and
yon, was over. I had found eternal shelter in a true guru.

"Come; I will show you the hermitage." Master rose from his tiger
mat.  I glanced about me; my gaze fell with astonishment on a wall
picture, garlanded with a spray of jasmine.

"Lahiri Mahasaya!"

"Yes, my divine guru." Sri Yukteswar's tone was reverently vibrant.
"Greater he was, as man and yogi, than any other teacher whose life
came within the range of my investigations."

Silently I bowed before the familiar picture. Soul-homage sped to
the peerless master who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps
to this hour.

Led by my guru, I strolled over the house and its grounds.
Large, ancient and well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a
massive-pillared courtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons
fluttered over the flat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the
ashram quarters.  A rear garden was pleasant with jackfruit, mango,
and plantain trees.  Balustraded balconies of upper rooms in the
two-storied building faced the courtyard from three sides. A spacious
ground-floor hall, with high ceiling supported by colonnades, was
used, Master said, chiefly during the annual festivities of DURGAPUJA.
{FN12-1} A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswar's sitting room,
whose small balcony overlooked the street. The ashram was plainly
furnished; everything was simple, clean, and utilitarian. Several
Western styled chairs, benches, and tables were in evidence.

Master invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was
served by two young disciples who were receiving hermitage training.

"Guruji, please tell me something of your life." I was squatting
on a straw mat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very
close, it seemed, beyond the balcony.

"My family name was Priya Nath Karar. I was born {FN12-2} here
in Serampore, where Father was a wealthy businessman. He left me
this ancestral mansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was
little; I found it slow and shallow. In early manhood, I undertook
the responsibilities of a householder, and have one daughter, now
married.  My middle life was blessed with the guidance of Lahiri
Mahasaya. After my wife died, I joined the Swami Order and received
the new name of Sri Yukteswar Giri. {FN12-3} Such are my simple
annals."

Master smiled at my eager face. Like all biographical sketches,
his words had given the outward facts without revealing the inner
man.

"Guruji, I would like to hear some stories of your childhood."

"I will tell you a few-each one with a moral!" Sri Yukteswar's
eyes twinkled with his warning. "My mother once tried to frighten
me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber. I went
there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed
the ghost. Mother never told me another horror-tale. Moral: Look
fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you.

"Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to
a neighbor. I kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that
dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing
appearance.  Moral: Attachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary
halo of attractiveness to the object of desire.

"A third story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I
heard my mother remark occasionally: 'A man who accepts a job under
anyone is a slave.' That impression became so indelibly fixed that
even after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by
investing my family endowment in land. Moral: Good and positive
suggestions should instruct the sensitive ears of children. Their
early ideas long remain sharply etched."

Master fell into tranquil silence. Around midnight he led me to
a narrow cot. Sleep was sound and sweet the first night under my
guru's roof.

Sri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his KRIYA YOGA
initiation. The technique I had already received from two disciples
of Lahiri Mahasaya-Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda-but in
Master's presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a great
light broke upon my being, like glory of countless suns blazing
together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my heart to an
innermost core, continued during the following day. It was late
that afternoon before I could bring myself to leave the hermitage.

"You will return in thirty days." As I reached my Calcutta home,
the fulfillment of Master's prediction entered with me. None of my
relatives made the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance
of the "soaring bird."

I climbed to my little attic and bestowed affectionate glances,
as though on a living presence. "You have witnessed my meditations,
and the tears and storms of my SADHANA. Now I have reached the
harbor of my divine teacher."

"Son, I am happy for us both." Father and I sat together in the
evening calm. "You have found your guru, as in miraculous fashion
I once found my own. The holy hand of Lahiri Mahasaya is guarding
our lives. Your master has proved no inaccessible Himalayan saint,
but one near-by. My prayers have been answered: you have not in
your search for God been permanently removed from my sight."

Father was also pleased that my formal studies would be resumed;
he made suitable arrangements. I was enrolled the following day at
the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.

Happy months sped by. My readers have doubtless made the perspicacious
surmise that I was little seen in the college classrooms. The
Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. Master accepted
my ubiquitous presence without comment. To my relief, he seldom
referred to the halls of learning. Though it was plain to all that
I was never cut out for a scholar, I managed to attain minimum
passing grades from time to time.

Daily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My
guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed,
he entered a state of SAMADHI. {FN12-4} It was simplicity itself
to discover when Master had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous
snores. {FN12-5} A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a
soundless state of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy.

Breakfast did not follow; first came a long walk by the Ganges.
Those morning strolls with my guru-how real and vivid still! In
the easy resurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side:
the early sun is warming the river. His voice rings out, rich with
the authenticity of wisdom.

A bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, according to Master's
daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My
guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had
eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple
diet which proved suited to one's constitution.

Master ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of
beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo GHEE or melted
butter.  Another day he might have lentil-DHAL or CHANNA {FN12-6}
curry with vegetables. For dessert, mangoes or oranges with rice
pudding, or jackfruit juice.

Visitors appeared in the afternoons. A steady stream poured from
the world into the hermitage tranquillity. Everyone found in Master
an equal courtesy and kindness. To a man who has realized himself
as a soul, not the body or the ego, the rest of humanity assumes
a striking similarity of aspect.

The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped
MAYA; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast
an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration
to those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did
he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would listen
respectfully to words of truth from a child, and openly ignore a
conceited pundit.

[Illustration: My Master, Sri Yukteswar, Disciple of Lahiri
Mahasaya--see yukteswar.jpg]

Eight o'clock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering
guests. My guru would not excuse himself to eat alone; none left his
ashram hungry or dissatisfied. Sri Yukteswar was never at a loss,
never dismayed by unexpected visitors; scanty food would emerge
a banquet under his resourceful direction. Yet he was economical;
his modest funds went far. "Be comfortable within your purse,"
he often said. "Extravagance will buy you discomfort." Whether in
the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair
work, or other practical concerns, Master manifested the originality
of a creative spirit.

Quiet evening hours often brought one of my guru's discourses,
treasures against time. His every utterance was measured and chiseled
by wisdom. A sublime self-assurance marked his mode of expression:
it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke.
His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination
before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth,
all-pervasive with even a physiological aspect, came from him like
a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I
was in the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight
of his divinity automatically bowed my head before him.

If late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed
with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conversation. He was
incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal.
Always one with the Lord, he needed no separate time for communion.
A self-realized master has already left behind the stepping stone
of meditation. "The flower falls when the fruit appears." But saints
often cling to spiritual forms for the encouragement of disciples.

As midnight approached, my guru might fall into a doze with the
naturalness of a child. There was no fuss about bedding. He often
lay down, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was
the background for his customary tiger-skin seat.

A night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple
could summon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredness then,
no desire for sleep; Master's living words were sufficient. "Oh,
it is dawn! Let us walk by the Ganges." So ended many of my periods
of nocturnal edification.

My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-"How
to Outwit a Mosquito." At home my family always used protective
curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore
hermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. Yet the
insects were in full residency; I was bitten from head to foot. My
guru took pity on me.

"Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me." He laughed and added,
"If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate
on me!"

I was more than thankful to comply. Every night that I spent in
Serampore, my guru would ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains.

The mosquitoes one evening were especially virulent. But Master
failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to
the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a
propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later,
I coughed pretentiously to attract my guru's attention. I thought
I would go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as
the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites.

No responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was
not breathing. This was my first observation of him in the yogic
trance; it filled me with fright.

"His heart must have failed!" I placed a mirror under his nose;
no breath-vapor appeared. To make doubly certain, for minutes I
closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold
and motionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help.

"So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!" Master's voice was
shaky with laughter. "Why don't you go to bed? Is the whole world
going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito
consciousness."

Meekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized
that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please
me; he had no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic power was such that
he either could will them not to bite, or could escape to an inner
invulnerability.

"He was giving me a demonstration," I thought. "That is the yogic
state I must strive to attain." A yogi must be able to pass into,
and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of multitudinous
distractions never absent from this earth. Whether in the buzz of
insects or the pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the
senses must be barred. Sound and sight come then indeed, but to
worlds fairer than the banished Eden. {FN12-7}

The instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the
ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matchlessly
interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace.
A rude mosquito entered the idyl and competed for my attention. As
it dug a poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I automatically
raised an avenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An
opportune memory came to me of one of Patanjali's yoga aphorisms-that
on AHIMSA (harmlessness).

"Why didn't you finish the job?"

"Master! Do you advocate taking life?"

"No; but the deathblow already had been struck in your mind."

"I don't understand."

"Patanjali's meaning was the removal of DESIRE to kill." Sri
Yukteswar had found my mental processes an open book. "This world
is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of AHIMSA. Man
may be compelled to exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under
similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of life
have equal right to the air of MAYA. The saint who uncovers the
secret of creation will be in harmony with its countless bewildering
expressions. All men may approach that understanding who curb the
inner passion for destruction."

"Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a
wild beast?"

"No; man's body is precious. It has the highest evolutionary
value because of unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the
advanced devotee to fully grasp and express the loftiest aspects
of divinity.  No lower form is so equipped. It is true that one
incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or
any living thing. But the VEDAS teach that wanton loss of a human
body is a serious transgression against the karmic law."

I sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of one's natural
instincts is not always forthcoming.

It so happened that I never saw Master at close quarters with a
leopard or a tiger. But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only
to be conquered by my guru's love. This variety of snake is much
feared in India, where it causes more than five thousand deaths
annually. The dangerous encounter took place at Puri, where Sri
Yukteswar had a second hermitage, charmingly situated near the Bay
of Bengal.  Prafulla, a young disciple of later years, was with
Master on this occasion.

"We were seated outdoors near the ashram," Prafulla told me. "A
cobra appeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terror. Its
hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. My guru gave a
welcoming chuckle, as though to a child. I was beside myself with
consternation to see Master engage in a rhythmical clapping of
hands. {FN12-8} He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained
absolutely quiet, inwardly ejaculating what fervent prayers I could
muster. The serpent, very close to my guru, was now motionless,
seemingly magnetized by his caressing attitude. The frightful hood
gradually contracted; the snake slithered between Master's feet
and disappeared into the bushes.

"Why my guru would move his hands, and why the cobra would not
strike them, were inexplicable to me then," Prafulla concluded. "I
have since come to realize that my divine master is beyond fear of
hurt from any living creature."

One afternoon during my early months at the ashram, found Sri
Yukteswar's eyes fixed on me piercingly.

"You are too thin, Mukunda."

His remark struck a sensitive point. That my sunken eyes and
emaciated appearance were far from my liking was testified to by
rows of tonics in my room at Calcutta. Nothing availed; chronic
dyspepsia had pursued me since childhood. My despair reached an
occasional zenith when I asked myself if it were worth-while to
carry on this life with a body so unsound.

"Medicines have limitations; the creative life-force has none.
Believe that: you shall be well and strong."

Sri Yukteswar's words aroused a conviction of personally-applicable
truth which no other healer-and I had tried many!-had been able to
summon within me.

Day by day, behold! I waxed. Two weeks after Master's hidden
blessing, I had accumulated the invigorating weight which eluded
me in the past.  My persistent stomach ailments vanished with
a lifelong permanency. On later occasions I witnessed my guru's
instantaneous divine healings of persons suffering from ominous
disease-tuberculosis, diabetes, epilepsy, or paralysis. Not one
could have been more grateful for his cure than I was at sudden
freedom from my cadaverous aspect.

"Years ago, I too was anxious to put on weight," Sri Yukteswar told
me. "During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri
Mahasaya in Benares.

"'Sir, I have been very sick and lost many pounds.'

"'I see, Yukteswar, {FN12-9} you made yourself unwell, and now you
think you are thin.'

"This reply was far from the one I had expected; my guru, however,
added encouragingly:

"'Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.'

"Taking his words as a gesture of secret healing toward my receptive
mind, I was not surprised the next morning at a welcome accession
of strength. I sought out my master and exclaimed exultingly, 'Sir,
I feel much better today.'

"'Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.'

"'No, master!' I protested. 'It was you who helped me; this is the
first time in weeks that I have had any energy.'

"'O yes! Your malady has been quite serious. Your body is frail
yet; who can say how it will be tomorrow?'

"The thought of possible return of my weakness brought me a shudder
of cold fear. The following morning I could hardly drag myself to
Lahiri Mahasaya's home.

"'Sir, I am ailing again.'

"My guru's glance was quizzical. 'So! Once more you indispose
yourself.'

"'Gurudeva, I realize now that day by day you have been ridiculing
me.' My patience was exhausted. 'I don't understand why you disbelieve
my truthful reports.'

"'Really, it has been your thoughts that have made you feel
alternately weak and strong.' My master looked at me affectionately.
'You have seen how your health has exactly followed your expectations.
Thought is a force, even as electricity or gravitation. The human
mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God. I could show
you that whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely would
instantly come to pass.'

"Knowing that Lahiri Mahasaya never spoke idly, I addressed him
with great awe and gratitude: 'Master, if I think I am well and
have regained my former weight, shall that happen?'

"'It is so, even at this moment.' My guru spoke gravely, his gaze
concentrated on my eyes.

"Lo! I felt an increase not alone of strength but of weight. Lahiri
Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few hours at his feet, I
returned to my mother's home, where I stayed during my visits to
Benares.

"'My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy?' Mother
could hardly believe her eyes. My body was now of the same robust
dimensions it had possessed before my illness.

"I weighed myself and found that in one day I had gained fifty
pounds; they remained with me permanently. Friends and acquaintances
who had seen my thin figure were aghast with wonderment. A number
of them changed their mode of life and became disciples of Lahiri
Mahasaya as a result of this miracle.

"My guru, awake in God, knew this world to be nothing but an objectivized
dream of the Creator. Because he was completely aware of his unity
with the Divine Dreamer, Lahiri Mahasaya could materialize or
dematerialize or make any change he wished in the cosmic vision.
{FN12-10}

"All creation is governed by law," Sri Yukteswar concluded. "The ones
which manifest in the outer universe, discoverable by scientists,
are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the
realms of consciousness which can be known only through the inner
science of yoga. The hidden spiritual planes also have their
natural and lawful principles of operation. It is not the physical
scientist but the fully self-realized master who comprehends the
true nature of matter.  Thus Christ was able to restore the servant's
ear after it had been severed by one of the disciples." {FN12-11}

Sri Yukteswar was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures. Many of
my happiest memories are centered in his discourses. But his jeweled
thoughts were not cast into ashes of heedlessness or stupidity. One
restless movement of my body, or my slight lapse into absent-mindedness,
sufficed to put an abrupt period to Master's exposition.

"You are not here." Master interrupted himself one afternoon with
this disclosure. As usual, he was keeping track of my attention
with a devastating immediacy.

"Guruji!" My tone was a protest. "I have not stirred; my eyelids
have not moved; I can repeat each word you have uttered!"

"Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me
to remark that in your mental background you were creating three
institutions. One was a sylvan retreat on a plain, another on a
hilltop, a third by the ocean."

Those vaguely formulated thoughts had indeed been present almost
subconsciously. I glanced at him apologetically.

"What can I do with such a master, who penetrates my random musings?"

[Illustration: Main building at the Mount Washington Estates in
Los Angeles, established in 1925 as American headquarters for the
Self-Realization Fellowship.--see mtwash.jpg]

[Illustration:  Self-Realization Church of All Religions, Hollywood,
California.--see hollywood.jpg]

"You have given me that right. The subtle truths I am expounding
cannot be grasped without your complete concentration. Unless
necessary I do not invade the seclusion of others' minds. Man has
the natural privilege of roaming secretly among his thoughts. The
unbidden Lord does not enter there; neither do I venture intrusion."

"You are ever welcome, Master!"

"Your architectural dreams will materialize later. Now is the time
for study!"

Thus incidentally my guru revealed in his simple way the coming of
three great events in my life. Since early youth I had had enigmatic
glimpses of three buildings, each in a different setting. In the
exact sequence Sri Yukteswar had indicated, these visions took
ultimate form. First came my founding of a boys' yoga school on a
Ranchi plain, then my American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop,
finally a hermitage in southern California by the vast Pacific.

Master never arrogantly asserted: "I prophesy that such and such
an event shall occur!" He would rather hint: "Don't you think it
may happen?" But his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no
recanting; never did his slightly veiled words prove false.

Sri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanor. There
was naught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His feet
were firm on the earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical
people aroused his admiration. "Saintliness is not dumbness! Divine
perceptions are not incapacitating!" he would say. "The active
expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence."

In Master's life I fully discovered the cleavage between spiritual
realism and the obscure mysticism that spuriously passes as
a counterpart. My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical
realms. His only "marvelous" aura was one of perfect simplicity.
In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he was
freely expressive. Others talked of miracles but could manifest
nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned the subtle laws but secretly
operated them at will.

"A man of realization does not perform any miracle until he
receives an inward sanction," Master explained. "God does not wish
the secrets of His creation revealed promiscuously. {FN12-12} Also,
every individual in the world has inalienable right to his free
will. A saint will not encroach upon that independence."

The silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep
perceptions of the Infinite. No time remained for the interminable
"revelations" that occupy the days of teachers without self-realization.
"In shallow men the fish of little thoughts cause much commotion.
In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle."
This observation from the Hindu scriptures is not without discerning
humor.

Because of my guru's unspectacular guise, only a few of his
contemporaries recognized him as a superman. The popular adage: "He
is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom," could never be applied
to Sri Yukteswar. Though born a mortal like all others, Master had
achieved identity with the Ruler of time and space. In his life I
perceived a godlike unity. He had not found any insuperable obstacle
to mergence of human with Divine. No such barrier exists, I came
to understand, save in man's spiritual unadventurousness.

I always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar's holy feet.
Yogis teach that a disciple is spiritually magnetized by reverent
contact with a master; a subtle current is generated. The devotee's
undesirable habit-mechanisms in the brain are often cauterized; the
groove of his worldly tendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily
at least he may find the secret veils of MAYA lifting, and glimpse
the reality of bliss. My whole body responded with a liberating
glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru.

"Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent," Master told me, "or when
he conversed on other than strictly religious topics, I discovered
that nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge."

Sri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in
a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly
changed. A healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. Every
day with him was a new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never
did I find him deluded or intoxicated with greed or emotion or
anger or any human attachment.

"The darkness of MAYA is silently approaching. Let us hie homeward
within." With these words at dusk Master constantly reminded his
disciples of their need for KRIYA YOGA. A new student occasionally
expressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga
practice.

"Forget the past," Sri Yukteswar would console him. "The vanished
lives of all men are dark with many shames. Human conduct is ever
unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will
improve if you are making a spiritual effort now."

Master always had young CHELAS {FN12-13} in his hermitage. Their
spiritual and intellectual education was his lifelong interest:
even shortly before he passed on, he accepted for training two
six-year-old boys and one youth of sixteen. He directed their minds
and lives with that careful discipline in which the word "disciple"
is etymologically rooted. The ashram residents loved and revered
their guru; a slight clap of his hands sufficed to bring them
eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no one
ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, children looked
upon him as their own.

Master seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor would
he accept help from a student unless the willingness were sincere.
My guru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overlooked that
privileged task. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher-colored
swami robe; his laceless shoes, in accordance with yogi custom,
were of tiger or deer skin.

Master spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his
Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by
certain short cuts which he had ingeniously devised for the study
of English and Sanskrit.

Master was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous
attachment. The Infinite, he pointed out, properly manifests through
physical and mental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A
disciple once started a long fast. My guru only laughed: "Why not
throw the dog a bone?"

Sri Yukteswar's health was excellent; I never saw him unwell.
{FN12-14} He permitted students to consult doctors if it seemed
advisable. His purpose was to give respect to the worldly custom:
"Physicians must carry on their work of healing through God's laws
as applied to matter." But he extolled the superiority of mental
therapy, and often repeated: "Wisdom is the greatest cleanser."

"The body is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more,"
he said.  "Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities
with calmness, while trying at the same time to remove their hold.
Imagination is the door through which disease as well as healing
enters. Disbelieve in the reality of sickness even when you are
ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!"

Master numbered many doctors among his disciples. "Those who have
ferreted out the physical laws can easily investigate the science
of the soul," he told them. "A subtle spiritual mechanism is hidden
just behind the bodily structure." {FN12-15}

Sri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of
Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in
outer habits, inwardly he was the spiritual Oriental. He praised
the progressive, resourceful and hygienic habits of the West, and
the religious ideals which give a centuried halo to the East.

Discipline had not been unknown to me: at home Father was strict,
Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswar's training cannot be described
as other than drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical
of his disciples, whether in matters of moment or in the subtle
nuances of behavior.

"Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,"
he remarked on suitable occasion. "Straightforwardness without
civility is like a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor
with courtesy is helpful and admirable."

Master was apparently satisfied with my spiritual progress, for he
seldom referred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers
to reproof. My chief offenses were absentmindedness, intermittent
indulgence in sad moods, non-observance of certain rules of etiquette,
and occasional unmethodical ways.

"Observe how the activities of your father Bhagabati are well-organized
and balanced in every way," my guru pointed out. The two disciples
of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages
to Serampore. Father and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the
other's worth. Both had built an inner life of spiritual granite,
insoluble against the ages.

From transient teachers of my earlier life I had imbibed a few
erroneous lessons. A CHELA, I was told, need not concern himself
strenuously over worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly
performed my tasks, I was not chastised. Human nature finds such
instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Master's unsparing
rod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of
irresponsibility.

"Those who are too good for this world are adorning some other,"
Sri Yukteswar remarked. "So long as you breathe the free air of
earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. He alone
who has fully mastered the breathless state {FN12-16} is freed from
cosmic imperatives. I will not fail to let you know when you have
attained the final perfection."

My guru could never be bribed, even by love. He showed no leniency
to anyone who, like myself, willingly offered to be his disciple.
Whether Master and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers,
or were alone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided
sharply. No trifling lapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped
his rebuke.  This flattening treatment was hard to endure, but my
resolve was to allow Sri Yukteswar to iron out each of my psychological
kinks. As he labored at this titanic transformation, I shook many
times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer.

"If you don't like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any
time," Master assured me. "I want nothing from you but your own
improvement.  Stay only if you feel benefited."

For every humbling blow he dealt my vanity, for every tooth in my
metaphorical jaw he knocked loose with stunning aim, I am grateful
beyond any facility of expression. The hard core of human egotism
is hardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the
Divine finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to
percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness.

Sri Yukteswar's wisdom was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks,
he often replied to one's unspoken observation. "What a person
imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, may
be poles apart," he said. "Try to feel the thoughts behind the
confusion of men's verbiage."

But divine insight is painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular
with superficial students. The wise, always few in number, deeply
revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar would have been the most
soughtafter guru in India had his words not been so candid and so
censorious.

"I am hard on those who come for my training," he admitted to me.
"That is my way; take it or leave it. I will never compromise. But
you will be much kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try
to purify only in the fires of severity, searing beyond the average
toleration. The gentle approach of love is also transfiguring. The
inflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied
with wisdom. You will go to foreign lands, where blunt assaults
on the ego are not appreciated. A teacher could not spread India's
message in the West without an ample fund of accommodative patience
and forbearance." I refuse to state the amount of truth I later
came to find in Master's words!

Though Sri Yukteswar's undissembling speech prevented a large
following during his years on earth, nevertheless his living spirit
manifests today over the world, through sincere students of his
KRIYA YOGA and other teachings. He has further dominion in men's
souls than ever Alexander dreamed of in the soil.

Father arrived one day to pay his respects to Sri Yukteswar. My
parent expected, very likely, to hear some words in my praise. He
was shocked to be given a long account of my imperfections. It was
Master's practice to recount simple, negligible shortcomings with
an air of portentous gravity. Father rushed to see me. "From your
guru's remarks I thought to find you a complete wreck!" My parent
was between tears and laughter.

The only cause of Sri Yukteswar's displeasure at the time was that
I had been trying, against his gentle hint, to convert a certain
man to the spiritual path.

With indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with
downcast eyes, as though conscious of guilt. It was the only time
I ever saw the divine lion meek before me. The unique moment was
savored to the full.

"Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded
father?  Was that just?"

"I will not do it again." Master's tone was apologetic.

Instantly I was disarmed. How readily the great man admitted his
fault! Though he never again upset Father's peace of mind, Master
relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose.

New disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism
of others. Wise like the guru! Models of flawless discrimination!
But he who takes the offensive must not be defenseless. The same
carping students fled precipitantly as soon as Master publicly
unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical quiver.

"Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure,
are like diseased parts of the body, recoiling before even delicate
handling." This was Sri Yukteswar's amused comment on the flighty
ones.

There are disciples who seek a guru made in their own image. Such
students often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar.

"Neither do you comprehend God!" I retorted on one occasion. "When
a saint is clear to you, you will be one." Among the trillion
mysteries, breathing every second the inexplicable air, who may
venture to ask that the fathomless nature of a master be instantly
grasped?

Students came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of
oily sympathy and comfortable recognitions did not find it at the
hermitage. Master offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons,
but many disciples miserly demanded ego-balm as well. They departed,
preferring life's countless humiliations before any humility.
Master's blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom,
were too powerful for their spiritual sickness. They sought some
lesser teacher who, shading them with flattery, permitted the fitful
sleep of ignorance.

During my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive
fear of his reprimands. These were reserved, I soon saw, for disciples
who had asked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing student
made a protest, Sri Yukteswar would become unoffendedly silent.
His words were never wrathful, but impersonal with wisdom.

Master's insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he
seldom remarked on their defects, even if conspicuous. But toward
students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious
responsibility. Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform
the crude ore of ego-permeated humanity! A saint's courage roots
in his compassion for the stumbling eyeless of this world.

When I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked decrease
in my chastisement. In a very subtle way, Master melted into
comparative clemency. In time I demolished every wall of rationalization
and subconscious reservation behind which the human personality
generally shields itself. {FN12-17} The reward was an effortless
harmony with my guru. I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate,
and silently loving. Undemonstrative, however, he bestowed no word
of affection.

My own temperament is principally devotional. It was disconcerting
at first to find that my guru, saturated with JNANA but seemingly
dry of BHAKTI, {FN12-18} expressed himself only in terms of
cold spiritual mathematics. But as I tuned myself to his nature,
I discovered no diminution but rather increase in my devotional
approach to God. A self-realized master is fully able to guide his
various disciples along natural lines of their essential bias.

My relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless
possessed all eloquence. Often I found his silent signature on my
thoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting beside him, I
felt his bounty pouring peacefully over my being.

Sri Yukteswar's impartial justice was notably demonstrated during
the summer vacation of my first college year. I welcomed the opportunity
to spend uninterrupted months at Serampore with my guru.

"You may be in charge of the hermitage." Master was pleased over
my enthusiastic arrival. "Your duties will be the reception of
guests, and supervision of the work of the other disciples."

Kumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight
later for hermitage training. Remarkably intelligent, he quickly
won Sri Yukteswar's affection. For some unfathomable reason, Master
was very lenient to the new resident.

"Mukunda, let Kumar assume your duties. Employ your own time in
sweeping and cooking." Master issued these instructions after the
new boy had been with us for a month.

Exalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny.
In silent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for
daily counsel.

"Mukunda is impossible! You made me supervisor, yet the others go
to him and obey him." Three weeks later Kumar was complaining to
our guru. I overheard him from an adjoining room.

"That's why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlor."
Sri Yukteswar's withering tones were new to Kumar. "In this way you
have come to realize that a worthy leader has the desire to serve,
and not to dominate. You wanted Mukunda's position, but could not
maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier work as cook's
assistant."

After this humbling incident, Master resumed toward Kumar a former
attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who can solve the mystery of
attraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which
did not spurt for the fellow disciples. Though the new boy was
obviously Sri Yukteswar's favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal
idiosyncrasies, possessed even by masters, lend a rich complexity
to the pattern of life. My nature is seldom commandeered by a detail;
I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a more inaccessible benefit than
an outward praise.

Kumar spoke venomously to me one day without reason; I was deeply
hurt.

"Your head is swelling to the bursting point!" I added a warning
whose truth I felt intuitively: "Unless you mend your ways, someday
you will be asked to leave this ashram."

Laughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who
had just entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired
meekly to a corner.

"Maybe Mukunda is right." Master's reply to the boy came with
unusual coldness. I escaped without castigation.

A year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home.
He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never
authoritatively controlled his disciples' movements. On the boy's
return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly
apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing face.
Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, one who had lately
acquired a number of evil habits.

Master summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the
boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life.

"Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the
ashram tomorrow; I can't do it!" Tears stood in Sri Yukteswar's
eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. "The boy would never have
fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone away to
mix with undesirable companions. He has rejected my protection;
the callous world must be his guru still."

Kumar's departure brought me no elation; sadly I wondered how one
with power to win a master's love could ever respond to cheaper
allures.  Enjoyment of wine and sex are rooted in the natural man,
and require no delicacies of perception for their appreciation.
Sense wiles are comparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant with
its multicolored flowers: every part of the plant is poisonous. The
land of healing lies within, radiant with that happiness blindly
sought in a thousand misdirections. {FN12-19}

"Keen intelligence is two-edged," Master once remarked in reference
to Kumar's brilliant mind. "It may be used constructively or
destructively like a knife, either to cut the boil of ignorance,
or to decapitate one's self. Intelligence is rightly guided only
after the mind has acknowledged the inescapability of spiritual
law."

My guru mixed freely with men and women disciples, treating
all as his children. Perceiving their soul equality, he showed no
distinction or partiality.

"In sleep, you do not know whether you are a man or a woman," he
said.  "Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not become one,
so the soul, impersonating both man and woman, has no sex. The soul
is the pure, changeless image of God."

Sri Yukteswar never avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction.
Men, he said, were also a temptation to women. I once inquired of
my guru why a great ancient saint had called women "the door to
hell."

"A girl must have proved very troublesome to his peace of mind in
his early life," my guru answered causticly. "Otherwise he would have
denounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self-control."

If a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage,
Master would maintain an unresponsive silence. "Do not allow yourself
to be thrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face," he told
the disciples. "How can sense slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle
flavors escape them while they grovel in primal mud. All nice
discriminations are lost to the man of elemental lusts."

Students seeking to escape from the dualistic MAYA delusion received
from Sri Yukteswar patient and understanding counsel.

"Just as the purpose of eating is to satisfy hunger, not greed,
so the sex instinct is designed for the propagation of the species
according to natural law, never for the kindling of insatiable
longings," he said. "Destroy wrong desires now; otherwise they
will follow you after the astral body is torn from its physical
casing. Even when the flesh is weak, the mind should be constantly
resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome it
by impersonal analysis and indomitable will. Every natural passion
can be mastered.

"Conserve your powers. Be like the capacious ocean, absorbing
within all the tributary rivers of the senses. Small yearnings are
openings in the reservoir of your inner peace, permitting healing
waters to be wasted in the desert soil of materialism. The forceful
activating impulse of wrong desire is the greatest enemy to the
happiness of man.  Roam in the world as a lion of self-control;
see that the frogs of weakness don't kick you around."

The devotee is finally freed from all instinctive compulsions. He
transforms his need for human affection into aspiration for God
alone, a love solitary because omnipresent.

Sri Yukteswar's mother lived in the Rana Mahal district of Benares
where I had first visited my guru. Gracious and kindly, she was
yet a woman of very decided opinions. I stood on her balcony one
day and watched mother and son talking together. In his quiet,
sensible way, Master was trying to convince her about something.
He was apparently unsuccessful, for she shook her head with great
vigor.

"Nay, nay, my son, go away now! Your wise words are not for me! I
am not your disciple!"

Sri Yukteswar backed away without further argument, like a scolded
child. I was touched at his great respect for his mother even in
her unreasonable moods. She saw him only as her little boy, not as a
sage.  There was a charm about the trifling incident; it supplied
a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and
outwardly unbendable.

The monastic regulations do not allow a swami to retain connection
with worldly ties after their formal severance. He cannot perform
the ceremonial family rites which are obligatory on the householder.
Yet Shankara, the ancient founder of the Swami Order, disregarded
the injunctions. At the death of his beloved mother, he cremated her
body with heavenly fire which he caused to spurt from his upraised
hand.

Sri Yukteswar also ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less
spectacular. When his mother passed on, he arranged the crematory
services by the holy Ganges in Benares, and fed many Brahmins in
conformance with age-old custom.

The SHASTRIC prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome
narrow identifications. Shankara and Sri Yukteswar had wholly merged
their beings in the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by
rule.  Sometimes, too, a master purposely ignores a canon in order
to uphold its principle as superior to and independent of form. Thus
Jesus plucked ears of corn on the day of rest. To the inevitable
critics he said: "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for
the sabbath." {FN12-20}

Outside of the scriptures, seldom was a book honored by Sri
Yukteswar's perusal. Yet he was invariably acquainted with the
latest scientific discoveries and other advancements of knowledge.
A brilliant conversationalist, he enjoyed an exchange of views on
countless topics with his guests. My guru's ready wit and rollicking
laugh enlivened every discussion. Often grave, Master was never
gloomy. "To seek the Lord, one need not disfigure his face," he
would remark. "Remember that finding God will mean the funeral of
all sorrows."

Among the philosophers, professors, lawyers and scientists who came
to the hermitage, a number arrived for their first visit with the
expectation of meeting an orthodox religionist. A supercilious
smile or a glance of amused tolerance occasionally betrayed that
the newcomers anticipated nothing more than a few pious platitudes.
Yet their reluctant departure would bring an expressed conviction
that Sri Yukteswar had shown precise insight into their specialized
fields.

My guru ordinarily was gentle and affable to guests; his welcome was
given with charming cordiality. Yet inveterate egotists sometimes
suffered an invigorating shock. They confronted in Master either
a frigid indifference or a formidable opposition: ice or iron!

A noted chemist once crossed swords with Sri Yukteswar. The
visitor would not admit the existence of God, inasmuch as science
has devised no means of detecting Him.

"So you have inexplicably failed to isolate the Supreme Power in
your test tubes!" Master's gaze was stern. "I recommend an unheard-of
experiment. Examine your thoughts unremittingly for twenty-four
hours.  Then wonder no longer at God's absence."

A celebrated pundit received a similar jolt. With ostentatious
zeal, the scholar shook the ashram rafters with scriptural lore.
Resounding passages poured from the MAHABHARATA, the UPANISHADS,
{FN12-21} the BHASYAS {FN12-22} of Shankara.

"I am waiting to hear you." Sri Yukteswar's tone was inquiring, as
though utter silence had reigned. The pundit was puzzled.

"Quotations there have been, in superabundance." Master's words
convulsed me with mirth, as I squatted in my corner, at a respectful
distance from the visitor. "But what original commentary can you
supply, from the uniqueness of your particular life? What holy
text have you absorbed and made your own? In what ways have these
timeless truths renovated your nature? Are you content to be a
hollow victrola, mechanically repeating the words of other men?"

"I give up!" The scholar's chagrin was comical. "I have no inner
realization."

For the first time, perhaps, he understood that discerning placement
of the comma does not atone for a spiritual coma.

"These bloodless pedants smell unduly of the lamp," my guru remarked
after the departure of the chastened one. "They prefer philosophy
to be a gentle intellectual setting-up exercise. Their elevated
thoughts are carefully unrelated either to the crudity of outward
action or to any scourging inner discipline!"

Master stressed on other occasions the futility of mere book
learning.

"Do not confuse understanding with a larger vocabulary," he remarked.
"Sacred writings are beneficial in stimulating desire for inward
realization, if one stanza at a time is slowly assimilated. Continual
intellectual study results in vanity and the false satisfaction of
an undigested knowledge."

Sri Yukteswar related one of his own experiences in scriptural
edification. The scene was a forest hermitage in eastern Bengal,
where he observed the procedure of a renowned teacher, Dabru Ballav.
His method, at once simple and difficult, was common in ancient
India.

Dabru Ballav had gathered his disciples around him in the sylvan
solitudes. The holy BHAGAVAD GITA was open before them. Steadfastly
they looked at one passage for half an hour, then closed their eyes.
Another half hour slipped away. The master gave a brief comment.
Motionless, they meditated again for an hour. Finally the guru
spoke.

"Have you understood?"

"Yes, sir." One in the group ventured this assertion.

"No; not fully. Seek the spiritual vitality that has given these
words the power to rejuvenate India century after century." Another
hour disappeared in silence. The master dismissed the students,
and turned to Sri Yukteswar.

"Do you know the BHAGAVAD GITA?"

"No, sir, not really; though my eyes and mind have run through its
pages many times."

"Thousands have replied to me differently!" The great sage smiled
at Master in blessing. "If one busies himself with an outer display
of scriptural wealth, what time is left for silent inward diving
after the priceless pearls?"

Sri Yukteswar directed the study of his own disciples by the same
intensive method of one-pointedness. "Wisdom is not assimilated
with the eyes, but with the atoms," he said. "When your conviction
of a truth is not merely in your brain but in your being, you may
diffidently vouch for its meaning." He discouraged any tendency a
student might have to construe book-knowledge as a necessary step
to spiritual realization.

"The RISHIS wrote in one sentence profundities that commentating
scholars busy themselves over for generations," he remarked. "Endless
literary controversy is for sluggard minds. What more liberating
thought than 'God is'-nay, 'God'?"

But man does not easily return to simplicity. It is seldom "God"
for him, but rather learned pomposities. His ego is pleased, that
he can grasp such erudition.

Men who were pridefully conscious of high worldly position were likely,
in Master's presence, to add humility to their other possessions.
A local magistrate once arrived for an interview at the seaside
hermitage in Puri. The man, who held a reputation for ruthlessness, had
it well within his power to oust us from the ashram.  I cautioned
my guru about the despotic possibilities. But he seated himself
with an uncompromising air, and did not rise to greet the visitor.
Slightly nervous, I squatted near the door. The man had to content
himself with a wooden box; my guru did not request me to fetch
a chair. There was no fulfillment of the magistrate's obvious
expectation that his importance would be ceremoniously acknowledged.

A metaphysical discussion ensued. The guest blundered through
misinterpretations of the scriptures. As his accuracy sank, his
ire rose.

"Do you know that I stood first in the M. A. examination?" Reason
had forsaken him, but he could still shout.

"Mr. Magistrate, you forget that this is not your courtroom," Master
replied evenly. "From your childish remarks I would have surmised
that your college career was unremarkable. A university degree,
in any case, is not remotely related to Vedic realization. Saints
are not produced in batches every semester like accountants."

After a stunned silence, the visitor laughed heartily.

"This is my first encounter with a heavenly magistrate," he said.
Later he made a formal request, couched in the legal terms which
were evidently part and parcel of his being, to be accepted as a
"probationary" disciple.

My guru personally attended to the details connected with the
management of his property. Unscrupulous persons on various occasions
attempted to secure possession of Master's ancestral land. With
determination and even by instigating lawsuits, Sri Yukteswar
outwitted every opponent. He underwent these painful experiences from
a desire never to be a begging guru, or a burden on his disciples.

His financial independence was one reason why my alarmingly
outspoken Master was innocent of the cunnings of diplomacy. Unlike
those teachers who have to flatter their supporters, my guru was
impervious to the influences, open or subtle, of others' wealth.
Never did I hear him ask or even hint for money for any purpose.
His hermitage training was given free and freely to all disciples.

An insolent court deputy arrived one day at the Serampore ashram
to serve Sri Yukteswar with a legal summons. A disciple named Kanai
and myself were also present. The officer's attitude toward Master
was offensive.

"It will do you good to leave the shadows of your hermitage and breathe
the honest air of a courtroom." The deputy grinned contemptuously.
I could not contain myself.

"Another word of your impudence and you will be on the floor!" I
advanced threateningly.

"You wretch!" Kanai's shout was simultaneous with my own. "Dare
you bring your blasphemies into this sacred ashram?"

But Master stood protectingly in front of his abuser. "Don't get
excited over nothing. This man is only doing his rightful duty."

The officer, dazed at his varying reception, respectfully offered
a word of apology and sped away.

Amazing it was to find that a master with such a fiery will could
be so calm within. He fitted the Vedic definition of a man of God:
"Softer than the flower, where kindness is concerned; stronger than
the thunder, where principles are at stake."

There are always those in this world who, in Browning's words,
"endure no light, being themselves obscure." An outsider occasionally
berated Sri Yukteswar for an imaginary grievance. My imperturbable
guru listened politely, analyzing himself to see if any shred of
truth lay within the denunciation. These scenes would bring to my
mind one of Master's inimitable observations: "Some people try to
be tall by cutting off the heads of others!"

The unfailing composure of a saint is impressive beyond any sermon.
"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city." {FN12-23}

I often reflected that my majestic Master could easily have been
an emperor or world-shaking warrior had his mind been centered on
fame or worldly achievement. He had chosen instead to storm those
inner citadels of wrath and egotism whose fall is the height of a
man.

{FN12-1} "Worship of Durga." This is the chief festival of the
Bengali year and lasts for nine days around the end of September.
Immediately following is the ten-day festival of DASHAHARA ("the One
who removes ten sins"-three of body, three of mind, four of speech).
Both PUJAS are sacred to Durga, literally "the Inaccessible," an
aspect of Divine Mother, Shakti, the female creative force personified.

{FN12-2} Sri Yukteswar was born on May 10, 1855.

{FN12-3} YUKTESWAR means "united to God." GIRI is a classificatory
distinction of one of the ten ancient Swami branches. SRI means
"holy"; it is not a name but a title of respect.

{FN12-4} Literally, "to direct together." SAMADHI is a superconscious
state of ecstasy in which the yogi perceives the identity of soul
and Spirit.

{FN12-5} Snoring, according to physiologists, is an indication of
utter relaxation (to the oblivious practitioner, solely).

{FN12-6} DHAL is a thick soup made from split peas or other pulses.
CHANNA is a cheese of fresh curdled milk, cut into squares and
curried with potatoes.

{FN12-7} The omnipresent powers of a yogi, whereby he sees, hears,
tastes, smells, and feels his oneness in creation without the use
of sensory organs, have been described as follows in the TAITTIRIYA
ARANYAKA: "The blind man pierced the pearl; the fingerless put a
thread into it; the neckless wore it; and the tongueless praised
it."

{FN12-8} The cobra swiftly strikes at any moving object within its
range. Complete immobility is usually one's sole hope of safety.

{FN12-9} Lahiri Mahasaya actually said "Priya" (first or given
name), not "Yukteswar" (monastic name, not received by my guru
during Lahiri Mahasaya's lifetime). (See page 109.) "Yukteswar" is
substituted here, and in a few other places in this book, in order
to avoid the confusion, to reader, of two names.

{FN12-10} "Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire,
when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have
them."-MARK 11:24. Masters who possess the Divine Vision are fully
able to transfer their realizations to advanced disciples, as Lahiri
Mahasaya did for Sri Yukteswar on this occasion.

{FN12-11} "And one of them smote the servant of the high priest,
and cut off his right ear. And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye
thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him."-LUKE 22:50-51.

{FN12-12} "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast
ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their
feet, and turn again and rend you."-MATTHEW 7:6.

{FN12-13} Disciples; from Sanskrit verb root, "to serve."

{FN12-14} He was once ill in Kashmir, when I was absent from him.
(See chapter 23.)

{FN12-15} A courageous medical man, Charles Robert Richet, awarded
the Nobel Prize in physiology, wrote as follows: "Metaphysics is not
yet officially a science, recognized as such. But it is going to be.
. . .  At Edinburgh, I was able to affirm before 100 physiologists
that our five senses are not our only means of knowledge and that
a fragment of reality sometimes reaches the intelligence in other
ways. . . .  Because a fact is rare is no reason that it does
not exist. Because a study is difficult, is that a reason for not
understanding it? . . .  Those who have railed at metaphysics as
an occult science will be as ashamed of themselves as those who
railed at chemistry on the ground that pursuit of the philosopher's
stone was illusory. . . . In the matter of principles there are only
those of Lavoisier, Claude Bernard, and Pasteur-the EXPERIMENTAL
everywhere and always.  Greetings, then, to the new science which
is going to change the orientation of human thought."

{FN12-16} SAMADHI: perfect union of the individualized soul with
the Infinite Spirit.

{FN12-17} The subconsciously guided rationalizations of the mind
are utterly different from the infallible guidance of truth which
issues from the superconsciousness. Led by French scientists of
the Sorbonne, Western thinkers are beginning to investigate the
possibility of divine perception in man.

"For the past twenty years, students of psychology, influenced by
Freud, gave all their time to searching the subconscious realms,"
Rabbi Israel H. Levinthal pointed out in 1929. "It is true that
the subconscious reveals much of the mystery that can explain human
actions, but not all of our actions. It can explain the abnormal,
but not deeds that are above the normal. The latest psychology,
sponsored by the French schools, has discovered a new region in man,
which it terms the superconscious. In contrast to the subconscious
which represents the submerged currents of our nature, it reveals
the heights to which our nature can reach. Man represents a triple,
not a double, personality; our conscious and subconscious being
is crowned by a superconsciousness. Many years ago the English
psychologist, F.  W. H. Myers, suggested that 'hidden in the
deep of our being is a rubbish heap as well as a treasure house.'
In contrast to the psychology that centers all its researches
on the subconscious in man's nature, this new psychology of the
superconscious focuses its attention upon the treasure-house, the
region that alone can explain the great, unselfish, heroic deeds
of men."

{FN12-18} JNANA, wisdom, and BHAKTI, devotion: two of the main
paths to God.

{FN12-19} "Man in his waking state puts forth innumerable efforts
for experiencing sensual pleasures; when the entire group of sensory
organs is fatigued, he forgets even the pleasure on hand and goes
to sleep in order to enjoy rest in the soul, his own nature,"
Shankara, the great Vedantist, has written. "Ultra-sensual bliss
is thus extremely easy of attainment and is far superior to sense
delights which always end in disgust."

{FN12-20} MARK 2:27.

{FN12-21} The UPANISHADS or VEDANTA (literally, "end of the Vedas"),
occur in certain parts of the VEDAS as essential summaries. The
UPANISHADS furnish the doctrinal basis of the Hindu religion. They
received the following tribute from Schopenhauer: "How entirely
does the UPANISHAD breathe throughout the holy spirit of the VEDAS!
How is everyone who has become familiar with that incomparable book
stirred by that spirit to the very depths of his soul! From every
sentence deep, original, and sublime thoughts arise, and the whole
is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit. . . . The access
to the VEDAS by means of the UPANISHADS is in my eyes the greatest
privilege this century may claim before all previous centuries."

{FN12-22} Commentaries. Shankara peerlessly expounded the UPANISHADS.

CHAPTER: 13

THE SLEEPLESS SAINT

"Please permit me to go to the Himalayas. I hope in unbroken solitude
to achieve continuous divine communion."

I actually once addressed these ungrateful words to my Master.
Seized by one of the unpredictable delusions which occasionally
assail the devotee, I felt a growing impatience with hermitage
duties and college studies. A feebly extenuating circumstance is
that my proposal was made when I had been only six months with Sri
Yukteswar. Not yet had I fully surveyed his towering stature.

"Many hillmen live in the Himalayas, yet possess no God-perception."
My guru's answer came slowly and simply. "Wisdom is better sought
from a man of realization than from an inert mountain."

Ignoring Master's plain hint that he, and not a hill, was my teacher,
I repeated my plea. Sri Yukteswar vouchsafed no reply. I took his
silence for consent, a precarious interpretation readily accepted
at one's convenience.

In my Calcutta home that evening, I busied myself with travel
preparations. Tying a few articles inside a blanket, I remembered
a similar bundle, surreptitiously dropped from my attic window a
few years earlier. I wondered if this were to be another ill-starred
flight toward the Himalayas. The first time my spiritual elation had
been high; tonight conscience smote heavily at thought of leaving
my guru.

The following morning I sought out Behari Pundit, my Sanskrit
professor at Scottish Church College.

"Sir, you have told me of your friendship with a great disciple of
Lahiri Mahasaya. Please give me his address."

"You mean Ram Gopal Muzumdar. I call him the 'sleepless saint.'
He is always awake in an ecstatic consciousness. His home is at
Ranbajpur, near Tarakeswar."

I thanked the pundit, and entrained immediately for Tarakeswar.
I hoped to silence my misgivings by wringing a sanction from the
"sleepless saint" to engage myself in lonely Himalayan meditation.
Behari's friend, I heard, had received illumination after many
years of KRIYA YOGA practice in isolated caves.

At Tarakeswar I approached a famous shrine. Hindus regard it with
the same veneration that Catholics give to the Lourdes sanctuary in
France. Innumerable healing miracles have occurred at Tarakeswar,
including one for a member of my family.

"I sat in the temple there for a week," my eldest aunt once told
me.  "Observing a complete fast, I prayed for the recovery of your
Uncle Sarada from a chronic malady. On the seventh day I found a
herb materialized in my hand! I made a brew from the leaves, and
gave it to your uncle. His disease vanished at once, and has never
reappeared."

I entered the sacred Tarakeswar shrine; the altar contains nothing
but a round stone. Its circumference, beginningless and endless,
makes it aptly significant of the Infinite. Cosmic abstractions are
not alien even to the humblest Indian peasant; he has been accused
by Westerners, in fact, of living on abstractions!

My own mood at the moment was so austere that I felt disinclined
to bow before the stone symbol. God should be sought, I reflected,
only within the soul.

I left the temple without genuflection and walked briskly toward
the outlying village of Ranbajpur. My appeal to a passer-by for
guidance caused him to sink into long cogitation.

"When you come to a crossroad, turn right and keep going," he
finally pronounced oracularly.

Obeying the directions, I wended my way alongside the banks of
a canal. Darkness fell; the outskirts of the jungle village were
alive with winking fireflies and the howls of near-by jackals. The
moonlight was too faint to supply any reassurance; I stumbled on
for two hours.

Welcome clang of a cowbell! My repeated shouts eventually brought
a peasant to my side.

"I am looking for Ram Gopal Babu."

"No such person lives in our village." The man's tone was surly.
"You are probably a lying detective."

Hoping to allay suspicion in his politically troubled mind,
I touchingly explained my predicament. He took me to his home and
offered a hospitable welcome.

"Ranbajpur is far from here," he remarked. "At the crossroad, you
should have turned left, not right."

My earlier informant, I thought sadly, was a distinct menace to
travelers. After a relishable meal of coarse rice, lentil-DHAL,
and curry of potatoes with raw bananas, I retired to a small hut
adjoining the courtyard. In the distance, villagers were singing
to the loud accompaniment of MRIDANGAS {FN13-1} and cymbals. Sleep
was inconsiderable that night; I prayed deeply to be directed to
the secret yogi, Ram Gopal.

As the first streaks of dawn penetrated the fissures of my dark
room, I set out for Ranbajpur. Crossing rough paddy fields, I trudged
over sickled stumps of the prickly plant and mounds of dried clay.
An occasionally-met peasant would inform me, invariably, that my
destination was "only a KROSHA (two miles)." In six hours the sun
traveled victoriously from horizon to meridian, but I began to feel
that I would ever be distant from Ranbajpur by one KROSHA.

At midafternoon my world was still an endless paddy field. Heat
pouring from the avoidless sky was bringing me to near-collapse. As
a man approached at leisurely pace, I hardly dared utter my usual
question, lest it summon the monotonous: "Just a KROSHA."

The stranger halted beside me. Short and slight, he was physically
unimpressive save for an extraordinary pair of piercing dark eyes.

"I was planning to leave Ranbajpur, but your purpose was good, so
I awaited you." He shook his finger in my astounded face. "Aren't
you clever to think that, unannounced, you could pounce on me? That
professor Behari had no right to give you my address."

Considering that introduction of myself would be mere verbosity in
the presence of this master, I stood speechless, somewhat hurt at
my reception. His next remark was abruptly put.

"Tell me; where do you think God is?"

"Why, He is within me and everywhere." I doubtless looked as
bewildered as I felt.

"All-pervading, eh?" The saint chuckled. "Then why, young sir,
did you fail to bow before the Infinite in the stone symbol at the
Tarakeswar temple yesterday? {FN13-2} Your pride caused you the
punishment of being misdirected by the passer-by who was not bothered
by fine distinctions of left and right. Today, too, you have had
a fairly uncomfortable time of it!"

I agreed wholeheartedly, wonder-struck that an omniscient eye hid
within the unremarkable body before me. Healing strength emanated
from the yogi; I was instantly refreshed in the scorching field.

"The devotee inclines to think his path to God is the only way," he
said. "Yoga, through which divinity is found within, is doubtless
the highest road: so Lahiri Mahasaya has told us. But discovering
the Lord within, we soon perceive Him without. Holy shrines at
Tarakeswar and elsewhere are rightly venerated as nuclear centers
of spiritual power."

The saint's censorious attitude vanished; his eyes became
compassionately soft. He patted my shoulder.

"Young yogi, I see you are running away from your master. He
has everything you need; you must return to him. Mountains cannot
be your guru." Ram Gopal was repeating the same thought which Sri
Yukteswar had expressed at our last meeting.

"Masters are under no cosmic compulsion to limit their residence."
My companion glanced at me quizzically. "The Himalayas in India
and Tibet have no monopoly on saints. What one does not trouble to
find within will not be discovered by transporting the body hither
and yon. As soon as the devotee is WILLING to go even to the ends
of the earth for spiritual enlightenment, his guru appears near-by."

I silently agreed, recalling my prayer in the Benares hermitage,
followed by the meeting with Sri Yukteswar in a crowded lane.

"Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door
and be alone?"

"Yes." I reflected that this saint descended from the general to
the particular with disconcerting speed.

"That is your cave." The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination
which I have never forgotten. "That is your sacred mountain. That
is where you will find the kingdom of God."

His simple words instantaneously banished my lifelong obsession for
the Himalayas. In a burning paddy field I awoke from the monticolous
dreams of eternal snows.

"Young sir, your divine thirst is laudable. I feel great love for
you." Ram Gopal took my hand and led me to a quaint hamlet. The
adobe houses were covered with coconut leaves and adorned with
rustic entrances.

The saint seated me on the umbrageous bamboo platform of his small
cottage. After giving me sweetened lime juice and a piece of rock
candy, he entered his patio and assumed the lotus posture. In about
four hours I opened my meditative eyes and saw that the moonlit
figure of the yogi was still motionless. As I was sternly reminding
my stomach that man does not live by bread alone, Ram Gopal approached
me.

"I see you are famished; food will be ready soon."

A fire was kindled under a clay oven on the patio; rice and DHAL
were quickly served on large banana leaves. My host courteously
refused my aid in all cooking chores. "The guest is God," a Hindu
proverb, has commanded devout observance from time immemorial. In
my later world travels, I was charmed to see that a similar respect
for visitors is manifested in rural sections of many countries.
The city dweller finds the keen edge of hospitality blunted by
superabundance of strange faces.

The marts of men seemed remotely dim as I squatted by the yogi
in the isolation of the tiny jungle village. The cottage room
was mysterious with a mellow light. Ram Gopal arranged some torn
blankets on the floor for my bed, and seated himself on a straw
mat. Overwhelmed by his spiritual magnetism, I ventured a request.

"Sir, why don't you grant me a SAMADHI?"

"Dear one, I would be glad to convey the divine contact, but it
is not my place to do so." The saint looked at me with half-closed
eyes.  "Your master will bestow that experience shortly. The tree
was partly planted by the gardeners, and then the Chinese Minister,
accompanied by some members of the Grant family, proceeded to
the spot to perform the ceremony in the name of Li Hung Chang.

The Minister threw a few shovelfuls of earth on the roots of the tree,
and then read some words in Chinese from a scroll he carried.

The words were translated by the Secretary, and proved to be:
"This tree is planted at the side of the tomb of General U.S.

Grant, ex-President of the United States of America, for the
purpose of commemorating him, by Li Hung Chang, guardian of the
Prince, Grand Secretary of the State, and Earl of the first order.

"YANG YU, "Vice-President of the Centre Board.
Then I moved to a more inaccessible cave
and remained there for twenty-five years, entering the yoga union
for twenty hours daily. I did not need sleep, for I was ever
with God. My body was more rested in the complete calmness of the
superconsciousness than it could be by the partial peace of the
ordinary subconscious state.

"The muscles relax during sleep, but the heart, lungs, and
circulatory system are constantly at work; they get no rest. In
superconsciousness, the internal organs remain in a state of suspended
animation, electrified by the cosmic energy. By such means I have
found it unnecessary to sleep for years. The time will come when
you too will dispense with sleep."

"My goodness, you have meditated for so long and yet are unsure
of the Lord's favor!" I gazed at him in astonishment. "Then what
about us poor mortals?"

"Well, don't you see, my dear boy, that God is Eternity Itself? To
assume that one can fully know Him by forty-five years of meditation
is rather a preposterous expectation. Babaji assures us, however,
that even a little meditation saves one from the dire fear of death
and after-death states. Do not fix your spiritual ideal on a small
mountain, but hitch it to the star of unqualified divine attainment.
If you work hard, you will get there."

Enthralled by the prospect, I asked him for further enlightening
words. He related a wondrous story of his first meeting with Lahiri
Mahasaya's guru, Babaji. {FN13-3} Around midnight Ram Gopal fell
into silence, and I lay down on my blankets. Closing my eyes, I
saw flashes of lightning; the vast space within me was a chamber
of molten light.  I opened my eyes and observed the same dazzling
radiance. The room became a part of that infinite vault which I
beheld with interior vision.

"Why don't you go to sleep?"

"Sir, how can I sleep in the presence of lightning, blazing whether
my eyes are shut or open?"

"You are blessed to have this experience; the spiritual radiations
are not easily seen." The saint added a few words of affection.

At dawn Ram Gopal gave me rock candies and said I must depart. I
felt such reluctance to bid him farewell that tears coursed down
my cheeks.

"I will not let you go empty-handed." The yogi spoke tenderly. "I
will do something for you."

He smiled and looked at me steadfastly. I stood rooted to the
ground, peace rushing like a mighty flood through the gates of my
eyes. I was instantaneously healed of a pain in my back, which had
troubled me intermittently for years. Renewed, bathed in a sea of
luminous joy, I wept no more. After touching the saint's feet, I
sauntered into the jungle, making my way through its tropical tangle
until I reached Tarakeswar.

There I made a second pilgrimage to the famous shrine, and prostrated
myself fully before the altar. The round stone enlarged before
my inner vision until it became the cosmical spheres, ring within
ring, zone after zone, all dowered with divinity.

I entrained happily an hour later for Calcutta. My travels ended,
not in the lofty mountains, but in the Himalayan presence of my
Master.

{FN13-1} Hand-played drums, used only for devotional music.

{FN13-2} One is reminded here of Dostoevski's observation: "A man
who bows down to nothing can never bear the burden of himself."

{FN13-3} See chapter 35.


CHAPTER: 14

AN EXPERIENCE IN COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS

"I am here, Guruji." My shamefacedness spoke more eloquently for
me.

"Let us go to the kitchen and find something to eat." Sri Yukteswar's
manner was as natural as if hours and not days had separated us.

"Master, I must have disappointed you by my abrupt departure from
my duties here; I thought you might be angry with me."

"No, of course not! Wrath springs only from thwarted desires. I
do not expect anything from others, so their actions cannot be in
opposition to wishes of mine. I would not use you for my own ends;
I am happy only in your own true happiness."

"Sir, one hears of divine love in a vague way, but for the first
time I am having a concrete example in your angelic self! In the
world, even a father does not easily forgive his son if he leaves
his parent's business without warning. But you show not the slightest
vexation, though you must have been put to great inconvenience by
the many unfinished tasks I left behind."

We looked into each other's eyes, where tears were shining. A
blissful wave engulfed me; I was conscious that the Lord, in the
form of my guru, was expanding the small ardors of my heart into
the incompressible reaches of cosmic love.

A few mornings later I made my way to Master's empty sitting room.
I planned to meditate, but my laudable purpose was unshared by
disobedient thoughts. They scattered like birds before the hunter.

"Mukunda!" Sri Yukteswar's voice sounded from a distant inner
balcony.

I felt as rebellious as my thoughts. "Master always urges me to
meditate," I muttered to myself. "He should not disturb me when he
knows why I came to his room."

He summoned me again; I remained obstinately silent. The third time
his tone held rebuke.

"Sir, I am meditating," I shouted protestingly.

"I know how you are meditating," my guru called out, "with your
mind distributed like leaves in a storm! Come here to me."

Snubbed and exposed, I made my way sadly to his side.

"Poor boy, the mountains couldn't give what you wanted." Master
spoke caressively, comfortingly. His calm gaze was unfathomable.
"Your heart's desire shall be fulfilled."

Sri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He
struck gently on my chest above the heart.

My body became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs
as if by some huge magnet. Soul and mind instantly lost their
physical bondage, and streamed out like a fluid piercing light
from my every pore. The flesh was as though dead, yet in my intense
awareness I knew that never before had I been fully alive. My sense
of identity was no longer narrowly confined to a body, but embraced
the circumambient atoms. People on distant streets seemed to be
moving gently over my own remote periphery. The roots of plants and
trees appeared through a dim transparency of the soil; I discerned
the inward flow of their sap.

The whole vicinity lay bare before me. My ordinary frontal
vision was now changed to a vast spherical sight, simultaneously
all-perceptive.  Through the back of my head I saw men strolling far
down Rai Ghat Road, and noticed also a white cow who was leisurely
approaching. When she reached the space in front of the open ashram
gate, I observed her with my two physical eyes. As she passed by,
behind the brick wall, I saw her clearly still.

All objects within my panoramic gaze trembled and vibrated like
quick motion pictures. My body, Master's, the pillared courtyard,
the furniture and floor, the trees and sunshine, occasionally became
violently agitated, until all melted into a luminescent sea; even
as sugar crystals, thrown into a glass of water, dissolve after
being shaken. The unifying light alternated with materializations
of form, the metamorphoses revealing the law of cause and effect
in creation.

An oceanic joy broke upon calm endless shores of my soul. The Spirit
of God, I realized, is exhaustless Bliss; His body is countless
tissues of light. A swelling glory within me began to envelop towns,
continents, the earth, solar and stellar systems, tenuous nebulae,
and floating universes. The entire cosmos, gently luminous, like
a city seen afar at night, glimmered within the infinitude of
my being. The sharply etched global outlines faded somewhat at the
farthest edges; there I could see a mellow radiance, ever-undiminished.
It was indescribably subtle; the planetary pictures were formed of
a grosser light.

The divine dispersion of rays poured from an Eternal Source, blazing
into galaxies, transfigured with ineffable auras. Again and again
I saw the creative beams condense into constellations, then resolve
into sheets of transparent flame. By rhythmic reversion, sextillion
worlds passed into diaphanous luster; fire became firmament.

I cognized the center of the empyrean as a point of intuitive
perception in my heart. Irradiating splendor issued from my nucleus
to every part of the universal structure. Blissful AMRITA, the
nectar of immortality, pulsed through me with a quicksilverlike
fluidity. The creative voice of God I heard resounding as AUM,
{FN14-1} the vibration of the Cosmic Motor.

Suddenly the breath returned to my lungs. With a disappointment
almost unbearable, I realized that my infinite immensity was lost.
Once more I was limited to the humiliating cage of a body, not
easily accommodative to the Spirit. Like a prodigal child, I had
run away from my macrocosmic home and imprisoned myself in a narrow
microcosm.

My guru was standing motionless before me; I started to drop at his
holy feet in gratitude for the experience in cosmic consciousness
which I had long passionately sought. He held me upright, and spoke
calmly, unpretentiously.

"You must not get overdrunk with ecstasy. Much work yet remains
for you in the world. Come; let us sweep the balcony floor; then
we shall walk by the Ganges."

I fetched a broom; Master, I knew, was teaching me the secret of
balanced living. The soul must stretch over the cosmogonic abysses,
while the body performs its daily duties. When we set out later
for a stroll, I was still entranced in unspeakable rapture. I saw
our bodies as two astral pictures, moving over a road by the river
whose essence was sheer light.

"It is the Spirit of God that actively sustains every form and
force in the universe; yet He is transcendental and aloof in the
blissful uncreated void beyond the worlds of vibratory phenomena,"
{FN14-2} Master explained. "Saints who realize their divinity even
while in the flesh know a similar twofold existence. Conscientiously
engaging in earthly work, they yet remain immersed in an inward
beatitude. The Lord has created all men from the limitless joy
of His being. Though they are painfully cramped by the body, God
nevertheless expects that souls made in His image shall ultimately
rise above all sense identifications and reunite with Him."

The cosmic vision left many permanent lessons. By daily stilling
my thoughts, I could win release from the delusive conviction that
my body was a mass of flesh and bones, traversing the hard soil of
matter. The breath and the restless mind, I saw, were like storms
which lashed the ocean of light into waves of material forms-earth,
sky, human beings, animals, birds, trees. No perception of the
Infinite as One Light could be had except by calming those storms.
As often as I silenced the two natural tumults, I beheld the
multitudinous waves of creation melt into one lucent sea, even as
the waves of the ocean, their tempests subsiding, serenely dissolve
into unity.

A master bestows the divine experience of cosmic consciousness when
his disciple, by meditation, has strengthened his mind to a degree
where the vast vistas would not overwhelm him. The experience
can never be given through one's mere intellectual willingness or
open-mindedness. Only adequate enlargement by yoga practice and
devotional BHAKTI can prepare the mind to absorb the liberating
shock of omnipresence. It comes with a natural inevitability to
the sincere devotee. His intense craving begins to pull at God with
an irresistible force. The Lord, as the Cosmic Vision, is drawn by
the seeker's magnetic ardor into his range of consciousness.

I wrote, in my later years, the following poem, "Samadhi," endeavoring
to convey the glory of its cosmic state:

  Vanished the veils of light and shade,
  Lifted every vapor of sorrow,
  Sailed away all dawns of fleeting joy,
  Gone the dim sensory mirage.
  Love, hate, health, disease, life, death,
  Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality.
  Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, melancholic whirlpools,
  Melting in the vast sea of bliss.
  The storm of MAYA stilled
  By magic wand of intuition deep.
  The universe, forgotten dream, subconsciously lurks,
  Ready to invade my newly-wakened memory divine.
  I live without the cosmic shadow,
  But it is not, bereft of me;
  As the sea exists without the waves,
  But they breathe not without the sea.
  Dreams, wakings, states of deep TURIA sleep,
  Present, past, future, no more for me,
  But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere.
  Planets, stars, stardust, earth,
  Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms,
  Creation's molding furnace,
  Glaciers of silent x-rays, burning electron floods,
  Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come,
  Every blade of grass, myself, mankind,
  Each particle of universal dust,
  Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust,
  I swallowed, transmuted all
  Into a vast ocean of blood of my own one Being!
  Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by meditation
  Blinding my tearful eyes,
  Burst into immortal flames of bliss,
  Consumed my tears, my frame, my all.
  Thou art I, I am Thou,
  Knowing, Knower, Known, as One!
  Tranquilled, unbroken thrill, eternally living, ever-new peace!
  Enjoyable beyond imagination of expectancy, SAMADHI bliss!
  Not an unconscious state
  Or mental chloroform without wilful return,
  SAMADHI but extends my conscious realm
  Beyond limits of the mortal frame
  To farthest boundary of eternity
  Where I, the Cosmic Sea,
  Watch the little ego floating in Me.
  The sparrow, each grain of sand, fall not without My sight.
  All space floats like an iceberg in My mental sea.
  Colossal Container, I, of all things made.
  By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditation
  Comes this celestial SAMADHI.
  Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard,
  The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid!
  Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae!
  AUM blows upon vapors, opening wondrously their veils,
  Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons,
  Till, at last sound of the cosmic drum,
  Vanish the grosser lights into eternal rays
  Of all-pervading bliss.
  From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.
  Ocean of mind, I drink all creation's waves.
  Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,
  Lift aright.
  Myself, in everything, enters the Great Myself.
  Gone forever, fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory.
  Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and high above.
  Eternity and I, one united ray.
  A tiny bubble of laughter, I
  Am become the Sea of Mirth Itself.

Sri Yukteswar taught me how to summon the blessed experience at will,
and also how to transmit it to others if their intuitive channels
were developed. For months I entered the ecstatic union, comprehending
why the UPANISHADS say God is RASA, "the most relishable." One day,
however, I took a problem to Master.

"I want to know, sir-when shall I find God?"

"You have found Him."

"O no, sir, I don't think so!"

My guru was smiling. "I am sure you aren't expecting a venerable
Personage, adorning a throne in some antiseptic corner of the
cosmos!  I see, however, that you are imagining that the possession
of miraculous powers is knowledge of God. One might have the whole
universe, and find the Lord elusive still! Spiritual advancement
is not measured by one's outward powers, but only by the depth of
his bliss in meditation.

"EVER-NEW JOY IS GOD. He is inexhaustible; as you continue your
meditations during the years, He will beguile you with an infinite
ingenuity. Devotees like yourself who have found the way to God never
dream of exchanging Him for any other happiness; He is seductive
beyond thought of competition.

"How quickly we weary of earthly pleasures! Desire for material
things is endless; man is never satisfied completely, and pursues
one goal after another. The 'something else' he seeks is the Lord,
who alone can grant lasting joy.

"Outward longings drive us from the Eden within; they offer false
pleasures which only impersonate soul-happiness. The lost paradise
is quickly regained through divine meditation. As God is unanticipatory
Ever-Newness, we never tire of Him. Can we be surfeited with bliss,
delightfully varied throughout eternity?"

"I understand now, sir, why saints call the Lord unfathomable. Even
everlasting life could not suffice to appraise Him."

"That is true; but He is also near and dear. After the mind has been
cleared by KRIYA YOGA of sensory obstacles, meditation furnishes
a twofold proof of God. Ever-new joy is evidence of His existence,
convincing to our very atoms. Also, in meditation one finds His
instant guidance, His adequate response to every difficulty."

"I see, Guruji; you have solved my problem." I smiled gratefully.
"I do realize now that I have found God, for whenever the joy of
meditation has returned subconsciously during my active hours, I
have been subtly directed to adopt the right course in everything,
even details."

"Human life is beset with sorrow until we know how to tune in with
the Divine Will, whose 'right course' is often baffling to the
egoistic intelligence. God bears the burden of the cosmos; He alone
can give unerring counsel."

{FN14-1} "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God."-JOHN 1:1.

{FN14-2} "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
judgment unto the Son."-JOHN 5:22. "No man hath seen God at any
time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
he hath declared him."-JOHN 1:18. "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;
and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my
Father."-JOHN 14:12. "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,
whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said
to you."-JOHN 14:26.

These Biblical words refer to the threefold nature of God as Father,
Son, Holy Ghost (SAT, TAT, AUM in the Hindu scriptures). God the
Father is the Absolute, Unmanifested, existing BEYOND vibratory
creation. God the Son is the Christ Consciousness (Brahma or
KUTASTHA CHAITANYA) existing WITHIN vibratory creation; this Christ
Consciousness is the "only begotten" or sole reflection of the
Uncreated Infinite. Its outward manifestation or "witness" is AUM
or Holy Ghost, the divine, creative, invisible power which structures
all creation through vibration. AUM the blissful Comforter is heard
in meditation and reveals to the devotee the ultimate Truth.


CHAPTER: 15

THE CAULIFLOWER ROBBERY

"Master, a gift for you! These six huge cauliflowers were planted
with my hands; I have watched over their growth with the tender
care of a mother nursing her child." I presented the basket of
vegetables with a ceremonial flourish.

"Thank you!" Sri Yukteswar's smile was warm with appreciation.
"Please keep them in your room; I shall need them tomorrow for a
special dinner."

I had just arrived in Puri {FN15-1} to spend my college summer
vacation with my guru at his seaside hermitage. Built by Master
and his disciples, the cheerful little two-storied retreat fronts
on the Bay of Bengal.

I awoke early the following morning, refreshed by the salty sea
breezes and the charm of my surroundings. Sri Yukteswar's melodious
voice was calling; I took a look at my cherished cauliflowers and
stowed them neatly under my bed.

"Come, let us go to the beach." Master led the way; several young
disciples and myself followed in a scattered group. Our guru surveyed
us in mild criticism.

"When our Western brothers walk, they usually take pride in unison.
Now, please march in two rows; keep rhythmic step with one another."
Sri Yukteswar watched as we obeyed; he began to sing: "Boys go to
and fro, in a pretty little row." I could not but admire the ease
with which Master was able to match the brisk pace of his young
students.

"Halt!" My guru's eyes sought mine. "Did you remember to lock the
back door of the hermitage?"

[Illustration: MY GURU'S SEASIDE HERMITAGE AT PURI A steady stream
of visitors poured from the world into the hermitage tranquillity.
A number of learned men came with the expectation of meeting an
orthodox religionist. A supercilious smile or a glance of amused
tolerance occasionally betreayed that the newcomers anticipated
nothing more than a few pious platitudes. Yet their reluctant
departure would bring an expressed conviction that Sri Yukteswar had
shown precise insight into their specialized fields of knowledge.
My guru always had young resident disciples in his hermitage.
He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline in
which the word "disciple" is etymologically rooted.--see puri.jpg]

"I think so, sir."

Sri Yukteswar was silent for a few minutes, a half-suppressed smile
on his lips. "No, you forgot," he said finally. "Divine contemplation
must not be made an excuse for material carelessness. You have
neglected your duty in safeguarding the ashram; you must be punished."

I thought he was obscurely joking when he added: "Your six cauliflowers
will soon be only five."

We turned around at Master's orders and marched back until we were
close to the hermitage.

"Rest awhile. Mukunda, look across the compound on our left; observe
the road beyond. A certain man will arrive there presently; he will
be the means of your chastisement."

I concealed my vexation at these incomprehensible remarks. A peasant
soon appeared on the road; he was dancing grotesquely and flinging
his arms about with meaningless gestures. Almost paralyzed with
curiosity, I glued my eyes on the hilarious spectacle. As the man
reached a point in the road where he would vanish from our view,
Sri Yukteswar said, "Now, he will return."

The peasant at once changed his direction and made for the rear
of the ashram. Crossing a sandy tract, he entered the building by
the back door. I had left it unlocked, even as my guru had said.
The man emerged shortly, holding one of my prized cauliflowers. He
now strode along respectably, invested with the dignity of possession.

The unfolding farce, in which my role appeared to be that of bewildered
victim, was not so disconcerting that I failed in indignant pursuit.
I was halfway to the road when Master recalled me. He was shaking
from head to foot with laughter.

"That poor crazy man has been longing for a cauliflower," he explained
between outbursts of mirth. "I thought it would be a good idea if
he got one of yours, so ill-guarded!"

I dashed to my room, where I found that the thief, evidently one
with a vegetable fixation, had left untouched my gold rings, watch,
and money, all lying openly on the blanket. He had crawled instead
under the bed where, completely hidden from casual sight, one of
my cauliflowers had aroused his singlehearted desire.

I asked Sri Yukteswar that evening to explain the incident which
had, I thought, a few baffling features.

My guru shook his head slowly. "You will understand it someday.
Science will soon discover a few of these hidden laws."

When the wonders of radio burst some years later on an astounded
world, I remembered Master's prediction. Age-old concepts of time
and space were annihilated; no peasant's home so narrow that London
or Calcutta could not enter! The dullest intelligence enlarged
before indisputable proof of one aspect of man's omnipresence.

The "plot" of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a
radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect human radio. Thoughts
are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether. Just
as a sensitized radio picks up a desired musical number out of
thousands of other programs from every direction, so my guru had
been able to catch the thought of the half-witted man who hankered
for a cauliflower, out of the countless thoughts of broadcasting
human wills in the world. {FN15-2} By his powerful will, Master was
also a human broadcasting station, and had successfully directed
the peasant to reverse his steps and go to a certain room for a
single cauliflower.

Intuition {FN15-3} is soul guidance, appearing naturally in man during
those instants when his mind is calm. Nearly everyone has had the
experience of an inexplicably correct "hunch," or has transferred
his thoughts effectively to another person.

The human mind, free from the static of restlessness, can perform
through its antenna of intuition all the functions of complicated
radio mechanisms-sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out
undesirable ones. As the power of a radio depends on the amount of
electrical current it can utilize, so the human radio is energized
according to the power of will possessed by each individual.

All thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a
master is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead.
Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a truth
cannot be created, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of
man result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga
science is to calm the mind, that without distortion it may mirror
the divine vision in the universe.

Radio and television have brought the instantaneous sound and sight
of remote persons to the firesides of millions: the first faint
scientific intimations that man is an all-pervading spirit. Not
a body confined to a point in space, but the vast soul, which the
ego in most barbaric modes conspires in vain to cramp.

"Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena
may yet appear which, when once established, will not astonish us
more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us
during the last century," Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in
physiology, has declared. "It is assumed that the phenomena which
we now accept without surprise, do not excite our astonishment
because they are understood. But this is not the case. If they do
not surprise us it is not because they are understood, it is because
they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to
surprise us, we should be surprised at everything-the fall of a
stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury
which expands when it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet,
phosphorus which burns when it is rubbed. . . . The science of
today is a light matter; the revolutions and evolutions which it
will experience in a hundred thousand years will far exceed the
most daring anticipations. The truths-those surprising, amazing,
unforeseen truths-which our descendants will discover, are even
now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak, and yet
we do not see them. But it is not enough to say that we do not see
them; we do not wish to see them; for as soon as an unexpected and
unfamiliar fact appears, we try to fit it into the framework of
the commonplaces of acquired knowledge, and we are indignant that
anyone should dare to experiment further."

A humorous occurrence took place a few days after I had been so
implausibly robbed of a cauliflower. A certain kerosene lamp could
not be found. Having so lately witnessed my guru's omniscient
insight, I thought he would demonstrate that it was child's play
to locate the lamp.

Master perceived my expectation. With exaggerated gravity he
questioned all ashram residents. A young disciple confessed that
he had used the lamp to go to the well in the back yard.

Sri Yukteswar gave the solemn counsel: "Seek the lamp near the
well."

I rushed there; no lamp! Crestfallen, I returned to my guru. He
was now laughing heartily, without compunction for my disillusionment.

"Too bad I couldn't direct you to the vanished lamp; I am not a
fortune teller!" With twinkling eyes, he added, "I am not even a
satisfactory Sherlock Holmes!"

I realized that Master would never display his powers when challenged,
or for a triviality.

Delightful weeks sped by. Sri Yukteswar was planning a religious
procession. He asked me to lead the disciples over the town and
beach of Puri. The festive day dawned as one of the hottest of the
summer.

"Guruji, how can I take the barefooted students over the fiery
sands?" I spoke despairingly.

"I will tell you a secret," Master responded. "The Lord will send
an umbrella of clouds; you all shall walk in comfort."

I happily organized the procession; our group started from the
ashram with a SAT-SANGA banner. {FN15-4} Designed by Sri Yukteswar,
it bore the symbol of the single {FN15-5} eye, the telescopic gaze
of intuition.

No sooner had we left the hermitage than the part of the sky which
was overhead became filled with clouds as though by magic. To the
accompaniment of astonished ejaculations from all sides, a very
light shower fell, cooling the city streets and the burning seashore.
The soothing drops descended during the two hours of the parade.
The exact instant at which our group returned to the ashram, the
clouds and rain passed away tracelessly.

"You see how God feels for us," Master replied after I had expressed
my gratitude. "The Lord responds to all and works for all. Just as
He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sincere desire of the
devotee. Seldom do men realize how often God heeds their prayers.
He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who approaches
Him trustingly. His children should ever have implicit faith in
the loving-kindness of their Omnipresent Father." {FN15-6}

Sri Yukteswar sponsored four yearly festivals, at the equinoxes
and solstices, when his students gathered from far and near. The
winter solstice celebration was held in Serampore; the first one
I attended left me with a permanent blessing.

The festivities started in the morning with a barefoot procession
along the streets. The voices of a hundred students rang out with
sweet religious songs; a few musicians played the flute and KHOL
KARTAL (drums and cymbals). Enthusiastic townspeople strewed the
path with flowers, glad to be summoned from prosaic tasks by our
resounding praise of the Lord's blessed name. The long tour ended
in the courtyard of the hermitage. There we encircled our guru,
while students on upper balconies showered us with marigold blossoms.

Many guests went upstairs to receive a pudding of CHANNA and
oranges.  I made my way to a group of brother disciples who were
serving today as cooks. Food for such large gatherings had to
be cooked outdoors in huge cauldrons. The improvised wood-burning
brick stoves were smoky and tear-provoking, but we laughed merrily
at our work. Religious festivals in India are never considered
troublesome; each one does his part, supplying money, rice,
vegetables, or his personal services.

Master was soon in our midst, supervising the details of the feast.
Busy every moment, he kept pace with the most energetic young
student.

A SANKIRTAN (group chanting), accompanied by the harmonium and
hand-played Indian drums, was in progress on the second floor. Sri
Yukteswar listened appreciatively; his musical sense was acutely
perfect.

"They are off key!" Master left the cooks and joined the artists.
The melody was heard again, this time correctly rendered.

In India, music as well as painting and the drama is considered a
divine art. Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva-the Eternal Trinity-were the
first musicians. The Divine Dancer Shiva is scripturally represented
as having worked out the infinite modes of rhythm in His cosmic
dance of universal creation, preservation, and dissolution, while
Brahma accentuated the time-beat with the clanging cymbals, and
Vishnu sounded the holy MRIDANGA or drum. Krishna, an incarnation
of Vishnu, is always shown in Hindu art with a flute, on which
he plays the enrapturing song that recalls to their true home the
human souls wandering in MAYA-delusion. Saraswati, goddess of wisdom,
is symbolized as performing on the VINA, mother of all stringed
instruments. The SAMA VEDA of India contains the world's earliest
writings on musical science.

The foundation stone of Hindu music is the RAGAS or fixed melodic
scales. The six basic RAGAS branch out into 126 derivative RAGINIS
(wives) and PUTRAS (sons). Each RAGA has a minimum of five notes:
a leading note (VADI or king), a secondary note (SAMAVADI or prime
minister), helping notes (ANUVADI, attendants), and a dissonant
note (VIVADI, the enemy).

Each one of the six basic RAGAS has a natural correspondence with
a certain hour of the day, season of the year, and a presiding
deity who bestows a particular potency. Thus, (1) the HINDOLE RAGA
is heard only at dawn in the spring, to evoke the mood of universal
love; (2) DEEPAKA RAGA is played during the evening in summer, to
arouse compassion; (3) MEGHA RAGA is a melody for midday in the
rainy season, to summon courage; (4) BHAIRAVA RAGA is played in the
mornings of August, September, October, to achieve tranquillity;
(5) SRI RAGA is reserved for autumn twilights, to attain pure love;
(6) MALKOUNSA RAGA is heard at midnights in winter, for valor.

The ancient rishis discovered these laws of sound alliance between
nature and man. Because nature is an objectification of AUM,
the Primal Sound or Vibratory Word, man can obtain control over
all natural manifestations through the use of certain MANTRAS or
chants. {FN15-7} Historical documents tell of the remarkable powers
possessed by Miyan Tan Sen, sixteenth century court musician for
Akbar the Great. Commanded by the Emperor to sing a night RAGA
while the sun was overhead, Tan Sen intoned a MANTRA which instantly
caused the whole palace precincts to become enveloped in darkness.

Indian music divides the octave into 22 SRUTIS or demi-semitones.
These microtonal intervals permit fine shades of musical expression
unattainable by the Western chromatic scale of 12 semitones. Each
one of the seven basic notes of the octave is associated in Hindu
mythology with a color, and the natural cry of a bird or beast-DO
with green, and the peacock; RE with red, and the skylark; MI with
golden, and the goat; FA with yellowish white, and the heron; SOL
with black, and the nightingale; LA with yellow, and the horse; SI
with a combination of all colors, and the elephant.

Three scales-major, harmonic minor, melodic minor-are the only
ones which Occidental music employs, but Indian music outlines 72
THATAS or scales. The musician has a creative scope for endless
improvisation around the fixed traditional melody or RAGA; he
concentrates on the sentiment or definitive mood of the structural
theme and then embroiders it to the limits of his own originality.
The Hindu musician does not read set notes; he clothes anew at each
playing the bare skeleton of the RAGA, often confining himself to
a single melodic sequence, stressing by repetition all its subtle
microtonal and rhythmic variations. Bach, among Western composers,
had an understanding of the charm and power of repetitious sound
slightly differentiated in a hundred complex ways.

Ancient Sanskrit literature describes 120 TALAS or time-measures.
On the 23d of December Touret sent in a petition to Lord Arlington,
bitterly complaining of the severity of his treatment, and endeavored
to turn the tables upon his accuser by representing that Groseilliers,
Radisson, and a certain priest in London tried to persuade him
to join them in making counterfeit coin, and for his refusal had
persecuted and entered the accusation against him.

To Des Groseilliers and Radisson must be given the credit of originating
the idea of forming a settlement at Hudson's Bay, out of which
grew the profitable organization of the Hudson's Bay Company.

They obtained through the English Ambassador to France an interview
with Prince Rupert, and laid before him their plans, which had been
before presented to the leading merchants of Canada and the
French Court. Prince Rupert at once foresaw the value of such an
enterprise, and aided them in procuring the required assistance
from several noblemen and gentlemen, to fit out in 1667 two ships
from London, the "Eagle," Captain Stannard, and the "Nonsuch,"
ketch, Captain Zechariah Gillam. This Gillam is called by Oldmixon
a New Englander, and was probably the same one who went in 1664/5
with Radisson and Groseilliers to Hudson's Strait on the unsuccessful
voyage from Boston.

Radisson thus alludes to the two ships that were fitted out in
London by the help of Prince Rupert and his associates. The third
year after their arrival in England "wee went out with a new Company
in two small vessels, my brother in one and I in another, and wee
went together four hundred leagues from the North of Ireland, where
a sudden greate storme did rise and put us asunder.

The sea was soe furious six or seven hours after, that it did almost
overturne our ship. So that wee were forced to cut our masts
rather then cutt our lives; but wee came back safe, God be
thanked; and the other, I hope, is gone on his voyage, God be with
him."
Captain Gillam and the ketch "Nonsuch," with Des Groseilliers,
proceeded on their voyage, "passed thro Hudson's Streights, and
then into Baffin's Bay to 75 deg.

North, and thence Southwards into 51 deg., where, in a river afterwards
called Prince Rupert river, He had a friendly correspondence with
the natives, built a Fort, named it Charles Fort, and returned with
Success.""I am pleased over your cheerful labors today and during the past
week of preparations. I want you with me; you may sleep in my bed
tonight."

This was a privilege I had never thought would fall to my lot. We
sat awhile in a state of intense divine tranquillity. Hardly ten
minutes after we had gotten into bed, Master rose and began to
dress.

"What is the matter, sir?" I felt a tinge of unreality in the
unexpected joy of sleeping beside my guru.

"I think that a few students who missed their proper train connections
will be here soon. Let us have some food ready."

"Guruji, no one would come at one o'clock in the morning!"

"Stay in bed; you have been working very hard. But I am going to
cook."

At Sri Yukteswar's resolute tone, I jumped up and followed him to
the small daily-used kitchen adjacent to the second-floor inner
balcony.  Rice and DHAL were soon boiling.

My guru smiled affectionately. "Tonight you have conquered fatigue
and fear of hard work; you shall never be bothered by them in the
future."

As he uttered these words of lifelong blessing, footsteps sounded
in the courtyard. I ran downstairs and admitted a group of students.

"Dear brother, how reluctant we are to disturb Master at this hour!"
One man addressed me apologetically. "We made a mistake about train
schedules, but felt we could not return home without a glimpse of
our guru."

"He has been expecting you and is even now preparing your food."

Sri Yukteswar's welcoming voice rang out; I led the astonished
visitors to the kitchen. Master turned to me with twinkling eyes.

"Now that you have finished comparing notes, no doubt you are
satisfied that our guests really did miss their train!"

I followed him to his bedroom a half hour later, realizing fully
that I was about to sleep beside a godlike guru.

{FN15-1} Puri, about 310 miles south of Calcutta, is a famous
pilgrimage city for devotees of Krishna; his worship is celebrated
there with two immense annual festivals, SNANAYATRA and RATHAYATRA.

{FN15-2} The 1939 discovery of a radio microscope revealed
a new world of hitherto unknown rays. "Man himself as well as all
kinds of supposedly inert matter constantly emits the rays that
this instrument 'sees,'" reported the ASSOCIATED PRESS. "Those
who believe in telepathy, second sight, and clairvoyance, have in
this announcement the first scientific proof of the existence of
invisible rays which really travel from one person to another. The
radio device actually is a radio frequency spectroscope. It does
the same thing for cool, nonglowing matter that the spectroscope
does when it discloses the kinds of atoms that make the stars. . .
. The existence of such rays coming from man and all living things
has been suspected by scientists for many years. Today is the first
experimental proof of their existence. The discovery shows that
every atom and every molecule in nature is a continuous radio
broadcasting station. . . . Thus even after death the substance
that was a man continues to send out its delicate rays. The wave
lengths of these rays range from shorter than anything now used
in broadcasting to the longest kind of radio waves.  The jumble of
these rays is almost inconceivable. There are millions of them. A
single very large molecule may give off 1,000,000 different wave
lengths at the same time. The longer wave lengths of this sort
travel with the ease and speed of radio waves. . . . There is one
amazing difference between the new radio rays and familiar rays
like light. This is the prolonged time, amounting to thousands of
years, which these radio waves will keep on emitting from undisturbed
matter."

{FN15-3} One hesitates to use "intuition"; Hitler has almost ruined
the word along with more ambitious devastations. The Latin root
meaning of INTUITION is "inner protection." The Sanskrit word AGAMA
means intuitional knowledge born of direct soul-perception; hence
certain ancient treatises by the rishis were called AGAMAS.

{FN15-4} SAT is literally "being," hence "essence; reality." SANGA
is "association." Sri Yukteswar called his hermitage organization
SAT-SANGA, "fellowship with truth."

{FN15-5} "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall
be full of light."-MATTHEW 6:22. During deep meditation, the single
or spiritual eye becomes visible within the central part of the
forehead.  This omniscient eye is variously referred to in scriptures
as the third eye, the star of the East, the inner eye, the dove
descending from heaven, the eye of Shiva, the eye of intuition,
etc.

{FN15-6} "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed
the eye, shall he not see? . . . he that teacheth man knowledge,
shall he not know?"-PSALM 94:9-10.

{FN15-7} Folklore of all peoples contains references to incantations
with power over nature. The American Indians are well-known to
have developed sound rituals for rain and wind. Tan Sen, the great
Hindu musician, was able to quench fire by the power of his song.
Charles Kellogg, the California naturalist, gave a demonstration
of the effect of tonal vibration on fire in 1926 before a group
of New York firemen.  "Passing a bow, like an enlarged violin bow,
swiftly across an aluminum tuning fork, he produced a screech like
intense radio static.  Instantly the yellow gas flame, two feet
high, leaping inside a hollow glass tube, subsided to a height of
six inches and became a sputtering blue flare. Another attempt with
the bow, and another screech of vibration, extinguished it."


CHAPTER: 16

OUTWITTING THE STARS

"Mukunda, why don't you get an astrological armlet?"

"Should I, Master? I don't believe in astrology."

"It is never a question of BELIEF; the only scientific attitude
one can take on any subject is whether it is TRUE. The law of
gravitation worked as efficiently before Newton as after him. The
cosmos would be fairly chaotic if its laws could not operate without
the sanction of human belief.

"Charlatans have brought the stellar science to its present state
of disrepute. Astrology is too vast, both mathematically {FN16-1}
and philosophically, to be rightly grasped except by men of profound
understanding. If ignoramuses misread the heavens, and see there a
scrawl instead of a script, that is to be expected in this imperfect
world. One should not dismiss the wisdom with the 'wise.'

"All parts of creation are linked together and interchange their
influences. The balanced rhythm of the universe is rooted in
reciprocity," my guru continued. "Man, in his human aspect, has
to combat two sets of forces-first, the tumults within his being,
caused by the admixture of earth, water, fire, air, and ethereal
elements; second, the outer disintegrating powers of nature. So long
as man struggles with his mortality, he is affected by the myriad
mutations of heaven and earth.

"Astrology is the study of man's response to planetary stimuli.
The stars have no conscious benevolence or animosity; they merely
send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves, these
do not help or harm humanity, but offer a lawful channel for the
outward operation of cause-effect equilibriums which each man has
set into motion in the past.

"A child is born on that day and at that hour when the celestial
rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His
horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable
past and its probable future results. But the natal chart can be
rightly interpreted only by men of intuitive wisdom: these are few.

"The message boldly blazoned across the heavens at the moment
of birth is not meant to emphasize fate-the result of past good
and evil-but to arouse man's will to escape from his universal
thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself
was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now
prevalent in his life. He can overcome any limitation, because he
created it by his own actions in the first place, and because he
has spiritual resources which are not subject to planetary pressure.

"Superstitious awe of astrology makes one an automaton, slavishly
dependent on mechanical guidance. The wise man defeats his
planets--which is to say, his past-by transferring his allegiance
from the creation to the Creator. The more he realizes his unity
with Spirit, the less he can be dominated by matter. The soul is
ever-free; it is deathless because birthless. It cannot be regimented
by stars.

"Man IS a soul, and HAS a body. When he properly places his sense
of identity, he leaves behind all compulsive patterns. So long as
he remains confused in his ordinary state of spiritual amnesia, he
will know the subtle fetters of environmental law.

"God is harmony; the devotee who attunes himself will never perform
any action amiss. His activities will be correctly and naturally timed
to accord with astrological law. After deep prayer and meditation
he is in touch with his divine consciousness; there is no greater
power than that inward protection."

"Then, dear Master, why do you want me to wear an astrological
bangle?" I ventured this question after a long silence, during
which I had tried to assimilate Sri Yukteswar's noble exposition.

"It is only when a traveler has reached his goal that he is justified
in discarding his maps. During the journey, he takes advantage of
any convenient short cut. The ancient rishis discovered many ways
to curtail the period of man's exile in delusion. There are certain
mechanical features in the law of karma which can be skillfully
adjusted by the fingers of wisdom.

"All human ills arise from some transgression of universal law.
The scriptures point out that man must satisfy the laws of nature,
while not discrediting the divine omnipotence. He should say: 'Lord,
I trust in Thee, and know Thou canst help me, but I too will do
my best to undo any wrong I have done.' By a number of means-by
prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by consultation with
saints, by use of astrological bangles-the adverse effects of past
wrongs can be minimized or nullified.

"Just as a house can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the
shock of lightning, so the bodily temple can be benefited by various
protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that pure metals
emit an astral light which is powerfully counteractive to negative
pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations
are constantly circulating in the universe; when a man's body is
being aided, he does not know it; when it is being disintegrated,
he is still in ignorance. Can he do anything about it?

"This problem received attention from our rishis; they found helpful
not only a combination of metals, but also of plants and-most
effective of all-faultless jewels of not less than two carats. The
preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied
outside of India. One little-known fact is that the proper jewels,
metals, or plant preparations are valueless unless the required
weight is secured, and unless these remedial agents are worn next
to the skin."

"Sir, of course I shall take your advice and get a bangle. I am
intrigued at the thought of outwitting a planet!"

"For general purposes I counsel the use of an armlet made of gold,
silver, and copper. But for a specific purpose I want you to get
one of silver and lead." Sri Yukteswar added careful directions.

"Guruji, what 'specific purpose' do you mean?"

"The stars are about to take an unfriendly interest in you, Mukunda.
Fear not; you shall be protected. In about a month your liver will
cause you much trouble. The illness is scheduled to last for six
months, but your use of an astrological armlet will shorten the
period to twenty-four days."

I sought out a jeweler the next day, and was soon wearing the
bangle.  My health was excellent; Master's prediction slipped from
my mind. He left Serampore to visit Benares. Thirty days after our
conversation, I felt a sudden pain in the region of my liver. The
following weeks were a nightmare of excruciating pain. Reluctant
to disturb my guru, I thought I would bravely endure my trial alone.

But twenty-three days of torture weakened my resolution; I entrained
for Benares. There Sri Yukteswar greeted me with unusual warmth,
but gave me no opportunity to tell him my woes in private. Many
devotees visited Master that day, just for a DARSHAN. {FN16-2}
Ill and neglected, I sat in a corner. It was not until after the
evening meal that all guests had departed. My guru summoned me to
the octagonal balcony of the house.

"You must have come about your liver disorder." Sri Yukteswar's
gaze was averted; he walked to and fro, occasionally intercepting
the moonlight. "Let me see; you have been ailing for twenty-four
days, haven't you?"

"Yes, sir."

"Please do the stomach exercise I have taught you."

"If you knew the extent of my suffering, Master, you would not ask
me to exercise." Nevertheless I made a feeble attempt to obey him.

"You say you have pain; I say you have none. How can such contradictions
exist?" My guru looked at me inquiringly.

I was dazed and then overcome with joyful relief. No longer could
I feel the continuous torment that had kept me nearly sleepless
for weeks; at Sri Yukteswar's words the agony vanished as though
it had never been.

I started to kneel at his feet in gratitude, but he quickly prevented
me.

"Don't be childish. Get up and enjoy the beauty of the moon over
the Ganges." But Master's eyes were twinkling happily as I stood
in silence beside him. I understood by his attitude that he wanted
me to feel that not he, but God, had been the Healer.

I wear even now the heavy silver and lead bangle, a memento of that
day-long-past, ever-cherished-when I found anew that I was living
with a personage indeed superhuman. On later occasions, when
I brought my friends to Sri Yukteswar for healing, he invariably
recommended jewels or the bangle, extolling their use as an act of
astrological wisdom.

I had been prejudiced against astrology from my childhood, partly
because I observed that many people are sequaciously attached to it,
and partly because of a prediction made by our family astrologer:
"You will marry three times, being twice a widower." I brooded
over the matter, feeling like a goat awaiting sacrifice before the
temple of triple matrimony.

"You may as well be resigned to your fate," my brother Ananta had
remarked. "Your written horoscope has correctly stated that you
would fly from home toward the Himalayas during your early years,
but would be forcibly returned. The forecast of your marriages is
also bound to be true."

A clear intuition came to me one night that the prophecy was wholly
false. I set fire to the horoscope scroll, placing the ashes in a
paper bag on which I wrote: "Seeds of past karma cannot germinate
if they are roasted in the divine fires of wisdom." I put the bag
in a conspicuous spot; Ananta immediately read my defiant comment.

"You cannot destroy truth as easily as you have burnt this paper
scroll." My brother laughed scornfully.

It is a fact that on three occasions before I reached manhood, my
family tried to arrange my betrothal. Each time I refused to fall
in with the plans, {FN16-3} knowing that my love for God was more
overwhelming than any astrological persuasion from the past.

"The deeper the self-realization of a man, the more he influences
the whole universe by his subtle spiritual vibrations, and the
less he himself is affected by the phenomenal flux." These words
of Master's often returned inspiringly to my mind.

Occasionally I told astrologers to select my worst periods, according
to planetary indications, and I would still accomplish whatever
task I set myself. It is true that my success at such times has
been accompanied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction
has always been justified: faith in the divine protection, and the
right use of man's God-given will, are forces formidable beyond
any the "inverted bowl" can muster.

The starry inscription at one's birth, I came to understand, is not
that man is a puppet of his past. Its message is rather a prod to
pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be
free from every limitation. God created each man as a soul, dowered
with individuality, hence essential to the universal structure,
whether in the temporary role of pillar or parasite. His freedom
is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depends not on outer
but inner victories.

Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year
equinoctial cycle to our present age. {FN16-4} The cycle is divided
into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years.
Within each Arc fall four YUGAS or Ages, called KALI, DWAPARA,
TRETA, and SATYA, corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze,
Silver, and Golden Ages.

My guru determined by various calculations that the last KALI YUGA
or Iron Age, of the Ascending Arc, started about A.D. 500. The Iron
Age, 1200 years in duration, is a span of materialism; it ended
about A.D.  1700. That year ushered in DWAPARA YUGA, a 2400-year
period of electrical and atomic-energy developments, the age of
telegraph, radio, airplanes, and other space-annihilators.

The 3600-year period of TRETA YUGA will start in A.D. 4100; its
age will be marked by common knowledge of telepathic communications
and other time-annihilators. During the 4800 years of SATYA YUGA,
final age in an ascending arc, the intelligence of a man will be
completely developed; he will work in harmony with the divine plan.

A descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending
Golden Age of 4800 years, then begins {FN16-5} for the world; man
gradually sinks into ignorance. These cycles are the eternal rounds
of MAYA, the contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe.
{FN16-6} Man, one by one, escapes from creation's prison of duality
as he awakens to consciousness of his inseverable divine unity with
the Creator.

Master enlarged my understanding not only of astrology but of the
world's scriptures. Placing the holy texts on the spotless table of
his mind, he was able to dissect them with the scalpel of intuitive
reasoning, and to separate errors and interpolations of scholars
from the truths as originally expressed by the prophets.

"Fix one's vision on the end of the nose." This inaccurate
interpretation of a BHAGAVAD GITA stanza, {FN16-7} widely accepted
by Eastern pundits and Western translators, used to arouse Master's
droll criticism.

"The path of a yogi is singular enough as it is," he remarked. "Why
counsel him that he must also make himself cross-eyed? The true
meaning of NASIKAGRAM is 'origin of the nose, not 'end of the
nose.' The nose begins at the point between the two eyebrows, the
seat of spiritual vision." {FN16-8} Because of one SANKHYA {FN16-9}
aphorism, "ISWAR-ASHIDHA,"-"A Lord of Creation cannot be deduced"
or "God is not proved," {FN16-10}--many scholars call the whole
philosophy atheistical.

"The verse is not nihilistic," Sri Yukteswar explained. "It merely
signifies that to the unenlightened man, dependent on his senses
for all final judgments, proof of God must remain unknown and
therefore non-existent. True SANKHYA followers, with unshakable
insight born of meditation, understand that the Lord is both existent
and knowable."

Master expounded the Christian Bible with a beautiful clarity.
It was from my Hindu guru, unknown to the roll call of Christian
membership, that I learned to perceive the deathless essence of
the Bible, and to understand the truth in Christ's assertion-surely
the most thrillingly intransigent ever uttered: "Heaven and earth
shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." {FN16-11}

The great masters of India mold their lives by the same godly ideals
which animated Jesus; these men are his proclaimed kin: "Whosoever
shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
brother, and sister, and mother." {FN16-12} "If ye continue in my
word," Christ pointed out, "then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." {FN16-13}
Freemen all, lords of themselves, the Yogi-Christs of India are part
of the immortal fraternity: those who have attained a liberating
knowledge of the One Father.

Wee were inform'd by the Indians that those white Bears have a Poison
in the Liver, that diffuses itself through the whole mass of the
body, which occasions these distempers unto thos that eat of them.

I observ'd during this Disorder, neer Mile Island, at the western
point, wee drove N. W. by the compass about 8 leagues in 6 hours, towards
Cape Henry. Wee had much adoe to recover out of the Ice, & had
like divers times to have perrish'd, but God was pleas'd to
preserve us. My brother-in-Law, fearing to bear too much saile,
stay'd behind. I arrived before him, the 26th of August, on the
western coast of Hudson's Bay, & we met the 2nd of 7ber, at the
entrance of the River called _Kakivvakiona_ by the Indians, which
significies "Let him that comes, goe."{FN16-14}

"The 'serpent' represents the coiled-up spinal energy which stimulates
the sex nerves. 'Adam' is reason, and 'Eve' is feeling. When the
emotion or Eve-consciousness in any human being is overpowered by
the sex impulse, his reason or Adam also succumbs. {FN16-15}

"God created the human species by materializing the bodies of man
and woman through the force of His will; He endowed the new species
with the power to create children in a similar 'immaculate' or divine
manner. {FN16-16} Because His manifestation in the individualized
soul had hitherto been limited to animals, instinct-bound and
lacking the potentialities of full reason, God made the first human
bodies, symbolically called Adam and Eve. To these, for advantageous
upward evolution, He transferred the souls or divine essence of two
animals. {FN16-17} In Adam or man, reason predominated; in Eve or
woman, feeling was ascendant. Thus was expressed the duality or
polarity which underlies the phenomenal worlds. Reason and feeling
remain in a heaven of cooperative joy so long as the human mind is
not tricked by the serpentine energy of animal propensities.

"The human body was therefore not solely a result of evolution from
beasts, but was produced by an act of special creation by God. The
animal forms were too crude to express full divinity; the human being
was uniquely given a tremendous mental capacity-the 'thousand-petaled
lotus' of the brain-as well as acutely awakened occult centers in
the spine.

"God, or the Divine Consciousness present within the first created
pair, counseled them to enjoy all human sensibilities, but not to
put their concentration on touch sensations. {FN16-18} These were
banned in order to avoid the development of the sex organs, which
would enmesh humanity in the inferior animal method of propagation.
The warning not to revive subconsciously-present bestial memories
was not heeded.  Resuming the way of brute procreation, Adam and
Eve fell from the state of heavenly joy natural to the original
perfect man.

"Knowledge of 'good and evil' refers to the cosmic dualistic
compulsion. Falling under the sway of MAYA through misuse of his
feeling and reason, or Eve-and Adam-consciousness, man relinquishes
his right to enter the heavenly garden of divine self-sufficiency.
{FN16-19} The personal responsibility of every human being is to
restore his 'parents' or dual nature to a unified harmony or Eden."

As Sri Yukteswar ended his discourse, I glanced with new respect
at the pages of GENESIS.

"Dear Master," I said, "for the first time I feel a proper filial
obligation toward Adam and Eve!"

{FN16-1} From astronomical references in ancient Hindu scriptures,
scholars have been able to correctly ascertain the dates of the
authors. The scientific knowledge of the rishis was very great; in
the KAUSHITAKI BRAHMANA we find precise astronomical passages which
show that in 3100 B.C. the Hindus were far advanced in astronomy,
which had a practical value in determining the auspicious times
for astrological ceremonies. In an article in EAST-WEST, February,
1934, the following summary is given of the JYOTISH or body
of Vedic astronomical treatises: "It contains the scientific lore
which kept India at the forefront of all ancient nations and made
her the mecca of seekers after knowledge. The very ancient BRAHMAGUPTA,
one of the JYOTISH works, is an astronomical treatise dealing with
such matters as the heliocentric motion of the planetary bodies
in our solar system, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the earth's
spherical form, the reflected light of the moon, the earth's daily
axial revolution, the presence of fixed stars in the Milky Way, the
law of gravitation, and other scientific facts which did not dawn
in the Western world until the time of Copernicus and Newton."

It is now well-known that the so-called "Arabic numerals," without
whose symbols advanced mathematics is difficult, came to Europe in
the 9th century, via the Arabs, from India, where that system of
notation had been anciently formulated. Further light on India's
vast scientific heritage will be found in Dr. P. C. Ray's HISTORY
OF HINDU CHEMISTRY, and in Dr. B. N. Seal's POSITIVE SCIENCES OF
THE ANCIENT HINDUS.

{FN16-2} The blessing which flows from the mere sight of a saint.

{FN16-3} One of the girls whom my family selected as a possible
bride for me, afterwards married my cousin, Prabhas Chandra Ghose.

{FN16-4} A series of thirteen articles on the historical verification
of Sri Yukteswar's YUGA theory appeared in the magazine EAST-WEST
(Los Angeles) from September, 1932, to September, 1933.

{FN16-5} In the year A.D. 12,500.

{FN16-6} The Hindu scriptures place the present world-age as
occurring within the KALI YUGA of a much longer universal cycle than
the simple 24,000-year equinoctial cycle with which Sri Yukteswar
was concerned.  The universal cycle of the scriptures is 4,300,560,000
years in extent, and measures out a Day of Creation or the length
of life assigned to our planetary system in its present form. This
vast figure given by the rishis is based on a relationship between
the length of the solar year and a multiple of Pi (3.1416, the
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle).

The life span for a whole universe, according to the ancient seers,
is 314,159,000,000,000 solar years, or "One Age of Brahma."

Scientists estimate the present age of the earth to be about two
billion years, basing their conclusions on a study of lead pockets
left as a result of radioactivity in rocks. The Hindu scriptures
declare that an earth such as ours is dissolved for one of two
reasons: the inhabitants as a whole become either completely good
or completely evil. The world-mind thus generates a power which
releases the captive atoms held together as an earth.

Dire pronouncements are occasionally published regarding an imminent
"end of the world." The latest prediction of doom was given by Rev.
Chas. G. Long of Pasadena, who publicly set the "Day of Judgment"
for Sept. 21, 1945. UNITED PRESS reporters asked my opinion; I
explained that world cycles follow an orderly progression according
to a divine plan. No earthly dissolution is in sight; two billion
years of ascending and descending equinoctial cycles are yet
in store for our planet in its present form. The figures given by
the rishis for the various world ages deserve careful study in the
West; the magazine TIME (Dec. 17, 1945, p. 6) called them "reassuring
statistics."

Christ Consciousness)."-JOHN 1:12.

{FN16-14} "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but

{FN16-15} "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me
of the tree, and I did eat. The woman said, The serpent beguiled

{FN16-16} "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed
them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and subdue it."-GEN. 1:27-28.

{FN16-17} "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
a living soul."-GEN. 2:7.

{FN16-18} "Now the serpent (sex force) was more subtil than any
beast of the field" (any other sense of the body).-GEN. 3:1.

{FN16-19} "And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
there he put the man whom he had formed."-GEN. 2:8. "Therefore the
Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground
from whence he was taken."-GEN. 3:23. The divine man first made
by God had his consciousness centered in the omnipotent single eye
in the forehead (eastward). The all-creative powers of his will,
focused at that spot, were lost to man when he began to "till the
ground" of his physical nature.


CHAPTER: 17

SASI AND THE THREE SAPPHIRES

"Because you and my son think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar,
I will take a look at him." The tone of voice used by Dr. Narayan
Chunder Roy implied that he was humoring the whim of half-wits. I
concealed my indignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter.

My companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His
young son Santosh had implored me to take an interest in his father.
So far my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.

Dr. They named me it _pauabickkomesibs_, which signifieth a small river
of copper. I asked him the reason. He told me, "Come, and I shall
shew thee the reason why."

I was in a place which was not 200 paces in the wood, where many
peeces of copper weare uncovered.Sri Yukteswar looked at me
inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic.

"Sir! The doctor is very much alive!"

"But in a short time he will be dead."

I was shocked. "Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh
yet hopes for time to change his father's materialistic views. I
beseech you, Master, to help the man."

"Very well; for your sake." My guru's face was impassive. "The
proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not
know it. In fifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians
will give him up for lost; his natural time to leave this earth is
six weeks from today. Due to your intercession, however, on that
date he will recover. But there is one condition. You must get
him to wear an astrological bangle; he will doubtless object as
violently as one of his horses before an operation!" Master chuckled.

After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I could
best employ the arts of cajolery on the recalcitrant doctor, Sri
Yukteswar made further disclosures.

"As soon as the man gets well, advise him not to eat meat. He will
not heed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is
feeling at his best, he will drop dead. Even that six-month extension
of life is granted him only because of your plea."

The following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet
at the jeweler's. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to
put it on.

"I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these
astrological superstitions." The doctor glanced at me belligerently.

I recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared
the man to a balky horse. Another seven days passed; the doctor,
suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later
the physician in attendance told me that his patient's case was
hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted
by diabetes.

I shook my head. "My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting
one month, Dr. Roy will be well."

The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a
fortnight later, with an apologetic air.

"Dr. Roy has made a complete recovery!" he exclaimed. "It is the
most amazing case in my experience. Never before have I seen a dying
man show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be
a healing prophet!"

After one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri
Yukteswar's advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the man
again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat
on the piazza of my family home on Gurpar Road.

"Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly
regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not
influenced me." It was true that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health.

But the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the
next block. "This morning Father dropped dead!"

This case was one of my strangest experiences with Master. He
healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief,
and extended the man's natural term on earth by six months, just
because of my earnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in
his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.

It was my proudest privilege to bring college friends to meet my
guru.  Many of them would lay aside-at least in the ashram!-their
fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism.

One of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in
Serampore. Master became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented
that his private life was wild and disorderly.

"Sasi, unless you reform, one year hence you will be dangerously
ill." Sri Yukteswar gazed at my friend with affectionate exasperation.
"Mukunda is the witness: don't say later that I didn't warn you."

Sasi laughed. "Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet
charity of cosmos in my own sad case! My spirit is willing but my
will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in nothing
else."

"At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help
you."

"I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully
believe you will protect me."

"In a year you will bring three sapphires," Sri Yukteswar replied
cryptically. "They will be of no use then."

Variations on this conversation took place regularly. "I can't
reform!" Sasi would say in comical despair. "And my trust in you,
Master, is more precious to me than any stone!"

A year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his
disciple, Naren Babu. About ten o'clock in the morning, as Sri
Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor,
I heard the front door open. Master straightened stiffly.

"It is that Sasi," he remarked gravely. "The year is now up; both
his lungs are gone. He has ignored my counsel; tell him I don't
want to see him."

Half stunned by Sri Yukteswar's sternness, I raced down the stairway.
Sasi was ascending.

"O Mukunda! I do hope Master is here; I had a hunch he might be."

"Yes, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed."

Sasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri
Yukteswar's feet, placing there three beautiful sapphires.

"Omniscient guru, the doctors say I have galloping tuberculosis!
They give me no longer than three more months! I humbly implore
your aid; I know you can heal me!"

"Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart
with your jewels; their time of usefulness is past." Master then
sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy's
sobs for mercy.

An intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely
testing the depth of Sasi's faith in the divine healing power. I was
not surprised a tense hour later when Master turned a sympathetic
gaze on my prostrate friend.

"Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other people's houses!
Return your sapphires to the jeweler's; they are an unnecessary
expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear not;
in a few weeks you shall be well."

Sasi's smile illumined his tear-marred face like sudden sun over
a sodden landscape. "Beloved guru, shall I take the medicines
prescribed by the doctors?"

Sri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. "Just as you wish-drink
them or discard them; it does not matter. It is more possible for
the sun and moon to interchange their positions than for you to
die of tuberculosis." He added abruptly, "Go now, before I change
my mind!"

With an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him
several times during the next few weeks, and was aghast to find
his condition increasingly worse.

"Sasi cannot last through the night." These words from his physician,
and the spectacle of my friend, now reduced almost to a skeleton,
sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my
tearful report.

"Why do you come here to bother me? You have already heard me assure
Sasi of his recovery."

I bowed before him in great awe, and retreated to the door. Sri
Yukteswar said no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking
eyes half-open, their vision fled to another world.

I returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta. With astonishment
I found my friend sitting up, drinking milk.

"O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hours ago I felt Master's presence
in the room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel
that through his grace I am entirely well."

In a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than ever
before. {FN17-1} But his singular reaction to his healing had an
ungrateful tinge: he seldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend
told me one day that he so deeply regretted his previous mode of
life that he was ashamed to face Master.

I could only conclude that Sasi's illness had had the contrasting
effect of stiffening his will and impairing his manners.

In the meanewhile I was garded by 50 men, who gave me a good part
of my cloathes. After kindling a fire againe, they gott theire supper
ready, which was sudenly don, ffor they dresse their meat halfe
boyled, mingling some yallowish meale in the broath of that infected
stinking meate; so whilst this was adoing they combed my head, and
with a filthy grease greased my head, and dashed all over my face
with redd paintings.

So then, when the meat was ready, they feeded me with their hod-pot,
forcing me to swallow it in a maner.
The Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead.
I fled to Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely
hoping that he would sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I
related my embarrassing unpreparedness.

But Master smiled consolingly. "You have wholeheartedly pursued
your spiritual duties, and could not help neglecting your college
work.  Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week:
you shall get through your ordeal without failure."

I returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts
that occasionally arose with unnerving ridicule. Surveying the
mountain of books on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a
wilderness. A long period of meditation brought me a labor-saving
inspiration. Opening each book at random, I studied only those
pages which lay thus exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen
hours a day for a week, I considered myself entitled to advise all
succeeding generations on the art of cramming.

The following days in the examination halls were a justification
of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the tests, though
by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were
ludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.

On his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise.
"Your Calcutta studies are now over. I will see that you pursue
your last two years of university work right here in Serampore."

I was puzzled. "Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this
town." Serampore College, the sole institution of higher learning,
offered only a two-year course in Intermediate Arts.

Master smiled mischievously. "I am too old to go about collecting
donations to establish an A.B. college for you. I guess I shall
have to arrange the matter through someone else."

Two months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College,
publicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient
funds to offer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch
affiliation of the University of Calcutta. I was one of the first
students to enroll in Serampore as an A.B. candidate.

"Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave
Calcutta and be near you every day in Serampore. Professor Howells
does not dream how much he owes to your silent help!"

Sri Yukteswar gazed at me with mock severity. "Now you won't have
to spend so many hours on trains; what a lot of free time for your
studies! Perhaps you will become less of a last-minute crammer and
more of a scholar." But somehow his tone lacked conviction.

{FN17-1} In 1936 I heard from a friend that Sasi was still in
excellent health.


CHAPTER: 18

A MOHAMMEDAN WONDER-WORKER

"Years ago, right in this very room you now occupy, a Mohammedan
wonder-worker performed four miracles before me!"

Sri Yukteswar made this surprising statement during his first visit
to my new quarters. Immediately after entering Serampore College,
I had taken a room in a near-by boardinghouse, called PANTHI. It
was an old-fashioned brick mansion, fronting the Ganges.

"Master, what a coincidence! Are these newly decorated walls really
ancient with memories?" I looked around my simply furnished room
with awakened interest.

"It is a long story." My guru smiled reminiscently. "The name of
the FAKIR {FN18-1} was Afzal Khan. He had acquired his extraordinary
powers through a chance encounter with a Hindu yogi.

"'Son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water.' A dust-covered SANNYASI
made this request of Afzal one day during his early boyhood in a
small village of eastern Bengal.

"'Master, I am a Mohammedan. How could you, a Hindu, accept a drink
from my hands?'

"'Your truthfulness pleases me, my child. I do not observe
the ostracizing rules of ungodly sectarianism. Go; bring me water
quickly.'

"Afzal's reverent obedience was rewarded by a loving glance from
the yogi.

"'You possess good karma from former lives,' he observed solemnly.
'I am going to teach you a certain yoga method which will give you
command over one of the invisible realms. The great powers that
will be yours should be exercised for worthy ends; never employ
them selfishly! I perceive, alas! that you have brought over from
the past some seeds of destructive tendencies. Do not allow them
to sprout by watering them with fresh evil actions. The complexity
of your previous karma is such that you must use this life to
reconcile your yogic accomplishments with the highest humanitarian
goals.'

"After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the
master vanished.

"Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His
miraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that
he was always accompanied by a disembodied spirit whom he called
'Hazrat.' This invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S
slightest wish.

"Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers.
Whatever object he touched and then replaced would soon disappear
without a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made the
Mohammedan an objectionable guest!

"He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from time to time,
representing himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewel he handled
would vanish shortly after he had left the shop.

"Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted
by the hope of learning his secrets. The FAKIR occasionally invited
them to travel with him. At the railway station he would manage
to touch a roll of tickets. These he would return to the clerk,
remarking: 'I have changed my mind, and won't buy them now.'
But when he boarded the train with his retinue, Afzal would be in
possession of the required tickets. {FN18-2}

"These exploits created an indignant uproar; Bengali jewelers and
ticket-sellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! The police
who sought to arrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the FAKIR
could remove incriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, take
this away.'"

Sri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my
room which overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear
more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles.

"This PANTHI house formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became
acquainted with Afzal and asked him here. My friend also invited
about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then,
and felt a lively curiosity about the notorious FAKIR." Master
laughed. "I took the precaution of not wearing anything valuable!
Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked:

"'You have powerful hands. Go downstairs to the garden; get a
smooth stone and write your name on it with chalk; then throw the
stone as far as possible into the Ganges.'

"I obeyed. As soon as the stone had vanished under distant waves,
the Mohammedan addressed me again:

"'Fill a pot with Ganges water near the front of this house.'

"After I had returned with a vessel of water, the FAKIR cried,
'Hazrat, put the stone in the pot!'

"The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and found
my signature as legible as when I had written it.

"Babu, {FN18-3} one of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy
antique gold watch and chain. The FAKIR examined them with ominous
admiration. Soon they were missing!

"'Afzal, please return my prized heirloom!' Babu was nearly in
tears.

"The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, 'You
have five hundred rupees in an iron safe. Bring them to me, and I
will tell you where to locate your timepiece.'

"The distraught Babu left immediately for his home. He came back
shortly and handed Afzal the required sum.

"'Go to the little bridge near your house,' the FAKIR instructed
Babu.  'Call on Hazrat to give you the watch and chain.'

"Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief
and no jewelry whatever.

"'When I commanded Hazrat as directed,' he announced, 'my watch
came tumbling down from the air into my right hand! You may be sure
I locked the heirloom in my safe before rejoining the group here!'

"Babu's friends, witnesses of the comicotragedy of the ransom for a
watch, were staring with resentment at Afzal. He now spoke placatingly.

"'Please name any drink you want; Hazrat will produce it.'

"A number asked for milk, others for fruit juices. I was not too
much shocked when the unnerved Babu requested whisky! The Mohammedan
gave an order; the obliging Hazrat sent sealed containers sailing
down the air and thudding to the floor. Each man found his desired
beverage.

"The promise of the fourth spectacular feat of the day was doubtless
gratifying to our host: Afzal offered to supply an instantaneous
lunch!

"'Let us order the most expensive dishes,' Babu suggested gloomily.
'I want an elaborate meal for my five hundred rupees! Everything
should be served on gold plates!'

"As soon as each man had expressed his preferences, the FAKIR addressed
himself to the inexhaustible Hazrat. A great rattle ensued; gold
platters filled with intricately-prepared curries, hot LUCHIS, and
many out-of-season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All
the food was delicious. After feasting for an hour, we started to
leave the room. A tremendous noise, as though dishes were being
piled up, caused us to turn around. Lo! there was no sign of the
glittering plates or the remnants of the meal."

"Guruji," I interrupted, "if Afzal could easily secure such things
as gold dishes, why did he covet the property of others?"

"The FAKIR was not highly developed spiritually," Sri Yukteswar
explained. "His mastery of a certain yoga technique gave him access
to an astral plane where any desire is immediately materialized.
Through the agency of an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan could
summon the atoms of any object from etheric energy by an act of
powerful will.  But such astrally-produced objects are structurally
evanescent; they cannot be long retained. Afzal still yearned for
worldly wealth which, though more hardly earned, has a more dependable
durability."

I laughed. "It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!"

"Afzal was not a man of God-realization," Master went on. "Miracles
of a permanent and beneficial nature are performed by true saints
because they have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator.
Afzal was merely an ordinary man with an extraordinary power of
penetrating a subtle realm not usually entered by mortals until
death."

"I understand now, Guruji. The after-world appears to have some
charming features."

Master agreed. "I never saw Afzal after that day, but a few years
later Babu came to my home to show me a newspaper account of the
Mohammedan's public confession. From it I learned the facts I have
just told you about Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru."

The gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled
by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: "I, Afzal Khan, am writing these
words as an act of penance and as a warning to those who seek the
possession of miraculous powers. For years I have been misusing the
wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of God and my
master. He wanted no meat for the time. Here we make a proposition,
being three and fifty ffrench in number, to make a slaughter without
any difficulty, they being but 100 beasts not able to budge, & as
many women.

That done, we could goe to their village att the breake of the
day, where we weare sure there weare not 20 men left, nor yong nor
old.

It was no great matter to deale with 5 or 600 women, & may be 1000
children; besides, the huntsmen should not be ready this 2 moneths
to come home.

"I touched the ball and walked away without reply. The old man
hobbled after me. He soon raised an outcry: 'My gold is gone!'

"As I paid no attention, he suddenly spoke in a stentorian voice
that issued oddly from his frail body:

"'Do you not recognize me?'

"I stood speechless, aghast at the belated discovery that this
unimpressive old cripple was none other than the great saint who,
long, long ago, had initiated me into yoga. He straightened himself;
his body instantly became strong and youthful.

"'So!' My guru's glance was fiery. 'I see with my own eyes that
you use your powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey
on it like a common thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is
now freed from you. No longer shall you be a terror in Bengal!'

"I called on Hazrat in anguished tones; for the first time, he did
not appear to my inner sight. But some dark veil suddenly lifted
within me; I saw clearly the blasphemy of my life.

"'My guru, I thank you for coming to banish my long delusion.' I
was sobbing at his feet. 'I promise to forsake my worldly ambitions.
I will retire to the mountains for lonely meditation on God, hoping
to atone for my evil past.'

"My master regarded me with silent compassion. 'I feel your
sincerity,' he said finally. 'Because of your earlier years of
strict obedience, and because of your present repentance, I will
grant you one boon. Your other powers are now gone, but whenever
food and clothing are needed, you may still call successfully on
Hazrat to supply them. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to divine
understanding in the mountain solitudes.'

"My guru then vanished; I was left to my tears and reflections.
Farewell, world! I go to seek the forgiveness of the Cosmic Beloved."

{FN18-1} A Moslem yogi; from the Arabic FAQIR, poor; originally
applied to dervishes under a vow of poverty.

{FN18-2} My father later told me that his company, the Bengal-Nagpur
Railway, had been one of the firms victimized by Afzal Khan.

{FN18-3} I do not recall the name of Sri Yukteswar's friend, and
must refer to him simply as "Babu" (Mister).


CHAPTER: 19

MY MASTER, IN CALCUTTA, APPEARS IN SERAMPORE

"I am often beset by atheistic doubts. Yet a torturing surmise
sometimes haunts me: may not untapped soul possibilities exist? Is
man not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?"

These remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the PANTHI boardinghouse,
were called forth by my invitation that he meet my guru.

"Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into KRIYA YOGA," I replied.
"It calms the dualistic turmoil by a divine inner certainty."

That evening Dijen accompanied me to the hermitage. In Master's
presence my friend received such spiritual peace that he was soon
a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily life are not
enough for man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar's
words Dijen found an incentive to those attempts-first painful,
then effortlessly liberating-to locate a realer self within his
bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample
enough for the Spirit.

As Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore
College, we got into the habit of walking together to the ashram
as soon as classes were over. We would often see Sri Yukteswar
standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with
a smile.

One afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me
at the door with disappointing news.

"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note."

The following day I received a post card from my guru. "I shall
leave Calcutta Wednesday morning," he had written. "You and Dijen
meet the nine o'clock train at Serampore station."

About eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from
Sri Yukteswar flashed insistently to my mind: "I am delayed; don't
meet the nine o'clock train."

I conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed
for departure.

"You and your intuition!" My friend's voice was edged in scorn. "I
prefer to trust Master's written word."

I shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality.
Muttering angrily, Dijen made for the door and closed it noisily
behind him.

As the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking
the street. The scant sunlight suddenly increased to an intense
brilliancy in which the iron-barred window completely vanished.
Against this dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized
figure of Sri Yukteswar!

Bewildered to the point of shock, I rose from my chair and knelt
before him. With my customary gesture of respectful greeting at
my guru's feet, I touched his shoes. These were a pair familiar to
me, of orange-dyed canvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth
brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his
robe, but also the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of
his toes within them. Too much astounded to utter a word, I stood
up and gazed at him questioningly.

"I was pleased that you got my telepathic message." Master's voice
was calm, entirely normal. "I have now finished my business in
Calcutta, and shall arrive in Serampore by the ten o'clock train."

As I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar went on, "This is not
an apparition, but my flesh and blood form. I have been divinely
commanded to give you this experience, rare to achieve on earth.
Meet me at the station; you and Dijen will see me coming toward you,
dressed as I am now. I shall be preceded by a fellow passenger-a
little boy carrying a silver jug."

My guru placed both hands on my head, with a murmured blessing. As
he concluded with the words, "TABA ASI," {FN19-1} I heard a peculiar
rumbling sound. {FN19-2} His body began to melt gradually within
the piercing light. First his feet and legs vanished, then his
torso and head, like a scroll being rolled up. To the very last, I
could feel his fingers resting lightly on my hair. The effulgence
faded; nothing remained before me but the barred window and a pale
stream of sunlight.

I remained in a half-stupor of confusion, questioning whether I had
not been the victim of a hallucination. A crestfallen Dijen soon
entered the room.

"Master was not on the nine o'clock train, nor even the nine-thirty."
My friend made his announcement with a slightly apologetic air.

"Come then; I know he will arrive at ten o'clock." I took Dijen's
hand and rushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests.
In about ten minutes we entered the station, where the train was
already puffing to a halt.

"The whole train is filled with the light of Master's aura! He is
there!" I exclaimed joyfully.

"You dream so?" Dijen laughed mockingly.

"Let us wait here." I told my friend details of the way in which our
guru would approach us. As I finished my description, Sri Yukteswar
came into view, wearing the same clothes I had seen a short time
earlier. He walked slowly in the wake of a small lad bearing a
silver jug.

For a moment a wave of cold fear passed through me, at the
unprecedented strangeness of my experience. I felt the materialistic,
twentieth-century world slipping from me; was I back in the ancient
days when Jesus appeared before Peter on the sea?

Being come nigh the Sault, we found a place where 2 of these men
sweated, & for want of covers buried themselves in the sand by
the watter side to keepe their bodyes from the flyes called
maringoines, which otherwise had killed them with their stings.

After we
had escorted our guru to his hermitage, my friend and I proceeded
toward Serampore College. Dijen halted in the street, indignation
streaming from his every pore.

"So! Master sent me a message! Yet you concealed it! I demand an
explanation!"

"Can I help it if your mental mirror oscillates with such restlessness
that you cannot register our guru's instructions?" I retorted.

The anger vanished from Dijen's face. "I see what you mean," he
said ruefully. "But please explain how you could know about the
child with the jug."

By the time I had finished the story of Master's phenomenal
appearance at the boardinghouse that morning, my friend and I had
reached Serampore College.

"The account I have just heard of our guru's powers," Dijen said,
"makes me feel that any university in the world is only a kindergarten."

CHAPTER: 20

WE DO NOT VISIT KASHMIR

"Father, I want to invite Master and four friends to accompany me
to the Himalayan foothills during my summer vacation. May I have
six train passes to Kashmir and enough money to cover our travel
expenses?"

As I had expected, Father laughed heartily. "This is the third time
you have given me the same cock-and-bull story. Didn't you make a
similar request last summer, and the year before that? At the last
moment, Sri Yukteswarji refuses to go."

"It is true, Father; I don't know why my guru will not give me his
definite word about Kashmir. {FN20-1} But if I tell him that I have
already secured the passes from you, somehow I think that this time
he will consent to make the journey."

Father was unconvinced at the moment, but the following day, after
some good-humored gibes, he handed me six passes and a roll of
ten-rupee bills.

"I hardly think your theoretical trip needs such practical props,"
he remarked, "but here they are."

That afternoon I exhibited my booty to Sri Yukteswar. Though he
smiled at my enthusiasm, his words were noncommittal: "I would like
to go; we shall see." He made no comment when I asked his little
hermitage disciple, Kanai, to accompany us. I also invited three
other friends--Rajendra Nath Mitra, Jotin Auddy, and one other boy.
Our date of departure was set for the following Monday.

On Saturday and Sunday I stayed in Calcutta, where marriage rites
for a cousin were being celebrated at my family home. I arrived in
Serampore with my luggage early Monday morning. Rajendra met me at
the hermitage door.

"Master is out, walking. He has refused to go."

I was equally grieved and obdurate. "I will not give Father a third
chance to ridicule my chimerical plans for Kashmir. Come; the rest
of us will go anyhow."

Rajendra agreed; I left the ashram to find a servant. Kanai, I knew,
would not take the trip without Master, and someone was needed to
look after the luggage. I bethought myself of Behari, previously
a servant in my family home, who was now employed by a Serampore
schoolmaster.  As I walked along briskly, I met my guru in front
of the Christian church near Serampore Courthouse.

I have seene some that have the nostrills so bigg that I putt into
it my 2 fists att once with ease.

Those that uses to be where the buffes be are not so bigg, but about
the bignesse of a coach horse. The wildmen call them the litle
sort.
"I remember. Nevertheless, I don't think Behari will be willing to
go."

I was exasperated. "He is just eagerly waiting for this opportunity!"

My guru silently resumed his walk; I soon reached the schoolmaster's
house. Behari, in the courtyard, greeted me with a friendly warmth
that abruptly vanished as soon as I mentioned Kashmir. With a murmured
word of apology, the servant left me and entered his employer's
house.  I waited half an hour, nervously assuring myself that
Behari's delay was being caused by preparations for his trip.
Finally I knocked at the front door.

"Behari left by the back stairs about thirty minutes ago," a man
informed me. A slight smile hovered about his lips.

I departed sadly, wondering whether my invitation had been too
coercive or whether Master's unseen influence were at work. Passing
the Christian church, again I saw my guru walking slowly toward
me.  Without waiting to hear my report, he exclaimed:

"So Behari would not go! Now, what are your plans?"

I felt like a recalcitrant child who is determined to defy his
masterful father. "Sir, I am going to ask my uncle to lend me his
servant, Lal Dhari."

"See your uncle if you want to," Sri Yukteswar replied with a
chuckle.  "But I hardly think you will enjoy the visit."

Apprehensive but rebellious, I left my guru and entered Serampore
Courthouse. My paternal uncle, Sarada Ghosh, a government attorney,
welcomed me affectionately.

"I am leaving today with some friends for Kashmir," I told him.
"For years I have been looking forward to this Himalayan trip."

"I am happy for you, Mukunda. Is there anything I can do to make
your journey more comfortable?"

These kind words gave me a lift of encouragement. "Dear uncle," I
said, "could you possibly spare me your servant, Lal Dhari?"

My simple request had the effect of an earthquake. Uncle jumped so
violently that his chair overturned, the papers on the desk flew in
every direction, and his pipe, a long, coconut-stemmed hubble-bubble,
fell to the floor with a great clatter.

"You selfish young man," he shouted, quivering with wrath, "what a
preposterous idea! Who will look after me, if you take my servant
on one of your pleasure jaunts?"

I concealed my surprise, reflecting that my amiable uncle's sudden
change of front was only one more enigma in a day fully devoted
to incomprehensibility. My retreat from the courthouse office was
more alacritous than dignified.

I returned to the hermitage, where my friends were expectantly
gathered. Conviction was growing on me that some sufficient if
exceedingly recondite motive was behind Master's attitude. Remorse
seized me that I had been trying to thwart my guru's will.

"Mukunda, wouldn't you like to stay awhile longer with me?" Sri
Yukteswar inquired. "Rajendra and the others can go ahead now, and
wait for you at Calcutta. There will be plenty of time to catch
the last evening train leaving Calcutta for Kashmir."

"Sir, I don't care to go without you," I said mournfully.

My friends paid not the slightest attention to my remark. They
summoned a hackney carriage and departed with all the luggage.
Kanai and I sat quietly at our guru's feet. After a half hour of
complete silence, Master rose and walked toward the second-floor
dining patio.

"Kanai, please serve Mukunda's food. His train leaves soon."

Getting up from my blanket seat, I staggered suddenly with nausea
and a ghastly churning sensation in my stomach. The stabbing pain
was so intense that I felt I had been abruptly hurled into some
violent hell.  Groping blindly toward my guru, I collapsed before
him, attacked by all symptoms of the dread Asiatic cholera. Sri
Yukteswar and Kanai carried me to the sitting room.

Racked with agony, I cried, "Master, I surrender my life to you;"
for I believed it was indeed fast ebbing from the shores of my
body.

Sri Yukteswar put my head on his lap, stroking my forehead with
angelic tenderness.

"You see now what would have happened if you were at the station
with your friends," he said. "I had to look after you in this strange
way, because you chose to doubt my judgment about taking the trip
at this particular time."

I understood at last. Inasmuch as great masters seldom see fit to
display their powers openly, a casual observer of the day's events
would have imagined that their sequence was quite natural. My guru's
intervention had been too subtle to be suspected. He had worked
his will through Behari and my Uncle Sarada and Rajendra and the
others in such an inconspicuous manner that probably everyone but
myself thought the situations had been logically normal.

As Sri Yukteswar never failed to observe his social obligations,
he instructed Kanai to go for a specialist, and to notify my uncle.

"Master," I protested, "only you can heal me. I am too far gone
for any doctor."

"Child, you are protected by the Divine Mercy. Don't worry about
the doctor; he will not find you in this state. You are already
healed."

With my guru's words, the excruciating suffering left me. I sat up
feebly. A doctor soon arrived and examined me carefully.

"You appear to have passed through the worst," he said. "I will
take some specimens with me for laboratory tests."

The following morning the physician arrived hurriedly. I was sitting
up, in good spirits.

"Well, well, here you are, smiling and chatting as though you had
had no close call with death." He patted my hand gently. "I hardly
expected to find you alive, after I had discovered from the specimens
that your disease was Asiatic cholera. You are fortunate, young
man, to have a guru with divine healing powers! We discover dayly
new contryvances of treason by a Councellor.

There is nothing done or said but we have advice of it. Their
dayly exercise is feasting, of warrs, songs, throwing of hattchetts,
breaking kettles. What can we do? We are in their hands.
"We were angry when you didn't turn up as agreed at the Calcutta
train. You have been sick?"

"Yes." I could not help laughing as my friends placed the luggage
in the same corner it had occupied yesterday. I quoted: "There was
a ship that went to Spain; when it arrived, it came back again!"

Master entered the room. I permitted myself a convalescent's liberty,
and captured his hand lovingly.

"Guruji," I said, "from my twelfth year on, I have made many
unsuccessful attempts to reach the Himalayas. I am finally convinced
that without your blessings the Goddess Parvati {FN20-2} will not
receive me!"

{FN20-1} Although Master failed to make any explanation, his
reluctance to visit Kashmir during those two summers may have been
a foreknowledge that the time was not ripe for his illness there
(see chapter 22).

{FN20-2} Literally, "of the mountains." Parvati, mythologically
represented as a daughter of Himavat or the sacred mountains, is
a name given to the SHAKTI or "consort" of Shiva.


CHAPTER: 21

WE VISIT KASHMIR

"You are strong enough now to travel. I will accompany you to
Kashmir," Sri Yukteswar informed me two days after my miraculous
recovery from Asiatic cholera.

That evening our party of six entrained for the north. Our first
leisurely stop was at Simla, a queenly city resting on the throne
of Himalayan hills. We strolled over the steep streets, admiring
the magnificent views.

"English strawberries for sale," cried an old woman, squatting in
a picturesque open market place.

Master was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought
a basketful and offered it to Kanai and myself, who were near-by.
I tasted one berry but spat it hastily on the ground.

"Sir, what a sour fruit! I could never like strawberries!"

My guru laughed. "Oh, you will like them-in America. At a dinner
there, your hostess will serve them with sugar and cream. After she
has mashed the berries with a fork, you will taste them and say:
'What delicious strawberries!' Then you will remember this day in
Simla."

Sri Yukteswar's forecast vanished from my mind, but reappeared
there many years later, shortly after my arrival in America. I was
a dinner guest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata)
in West Somerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries
was put on the table, my hostess picked up her fork and mashed my
berries, adding cream and sugar. "The fruit is rather tart; I think
you will like it fixed this way," she remarked.

I took a mouthful. "What delicious strawberries!" I exclaimed.
At once my guru's prediction in Simla emerged from the fathomless
cave of memory. It was staggering to realize that long ago Sri
Yukteswar's God-tuned mind had sensitively detected the program of
karmic events wandering in the ether of futurity.

Our party soon left Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There
we hired a large landau, drawn by two horses, in which we started
a seven-day trip to Srinagar, capital city of Kashmir. The second
day of our northbound journey brought into view the true Himalayan
vastness. As the iron wheels of our carriage creaked along the hot,
stony roads, we were enraptured with changing vistas of mountainous
grandeur.

"Sir," Auddy said to Master, "I am greatly enjoying these glorious
scenes in your holy company."

I felt a throb of pleasure at Auddy's appreciation, for I was acting
as host on this trip. Sri Yukteswar caught my thought; he turned
to me and whispered:

"Don't flatter yourself; Auddy is not nearly as entranced with the
scenery as he is with the prospect of leaving us long enough to
have a cigaret."

I was shocked. "Sir," I said in an undertone, "please do not break
our harmony by these unpleasant words. I can hardly believe that
Auddy is hankering for a smoke." {FN21-1} I looked apprehensively
at my usually irrepressible guru.

"Very well; I won't say anything to Auddy." Master chuckled. "But
you will soon see, when the landau halts, that Auddy is quick to
seize his opportunity."

The carriage arrived at a small caravanserai. As our horses were led
to be watered, Auddy inquired, "Sir, do you mind if I ride awhile
with the driver? I would like to get a little outside air."

Sri Yukteswar gave permission, but remarked to me, "He wants fresh
smoke and not fresh air."

The landau resumed its noisy progress over the dusty roads. Master's
eyes were twinkling; he instructed me, "Crane up your neck through
the carriage door and see what Auddy is doing with the air."

I obeyed, and was astounded to observe Auddy in the act of exhaling
rings of cigaret smoke. In some places in this lake where is an innumerable quantity of
fish, that in 2 houres they load their boat with as many as they
can carry.

At last [they] became so eminent strong that they weare of a minde
to fight against the neighbouring nation.
We continued on the labyrinthine way, adorned by views of rivers,
valleys, precipitous crags, and multitudinous mountain tiers.
Every night we stopped at rustic inns, and prepared our own food.
Sri Yukteswar took special care of my diet, insisting that I have
lime juice at all meals. I was still weak, but daily improving,
though the rattling carriage was strictly designed for discomfort.

Joyous anticipations filled our hearts as we neared central Kashmir,
paradise land of lotus lakes, floating gardens, gaily canopied
houseboats, the many-bridged Jhelum River, and flower-strewn
pastures, all ringed round by the Himalayan majesty. Our approach
to Srinagar was through an avenue of tall, welcoming trees. We
engaged rooms at a double-storied inn overlooking the noble hills.
No running water was available; we drew our supply from a near-by
well. The summer weather was ideal, with warm days and slightly
cold nights.

We made a pilgrimage to the ancient Srinagar temple of Swami
Shankara.  As I gazed upon the mountain-peak hermitage, standing
bold against the sky, I fell into an ecstatic trance. A vision
appeared of a hilltop mansion in a distant land. The lofty Shankara
ashram before me was transformed into the structure where, years
later, I established the Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters
in America. When I first visited Los Angeles, and saw the large
building on the crest of Mount Washington, I recognized it at once
from my long-past visions in Kashmir and elsewhere.
