                               1663-1664

March 1st.  Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at
noon to the 'Change, and after much business and meeting my uncle Wight,
who told me how Mr. Maes had like to have been trapanned yesterday, but
was forced to run for it; so with Creed and Mr. Hunt home to dinner, and
after a good and pleasant dinner, Mr. Hunt parted, and I took Mr. Creed
and my wife and down to Deptford, it being most pleasant weather, and
there till night discoursing with the officers there about several things,
and so walked home by moonshine, it being mighty pleasant, and so home,
and I to my office, where late about getting myself a thorough
understanding in the business of masts, and so home to bed, my left eye
being mightily troubled with rheum.

2nd.  "He's two-horned!" exclaimed Jack, watching intently. It was their
first meeting with one of the two-horned variety, and they were
relieved when he turned and slowly trotted off, the tick-birds on
his back settling down again.

That night Schoverling issued orders that with each halt the Masai should
construct a thorn zareba for the oxen, while big fires should be kept
blazing all night. Lions were very plainly in abundance, and they could
afford to run no risk of losing the cattle, or horses either.

Toward dawn they were aroused by Guru, on guard, to find the horses shivering
with fear and the glowing eyes of lions shining from the undergrowth
around the camp. A shot seemed to have no effect, until with a well-placed
bullet Schoverling killed one of the beasts and the rest disappeared
with threatening rumbles.

"That shows what we can expect, in this no-man's country," he said.
"We'll have worse than that later on, I'm afraid."
And his words were to prove true, though not exactly as he had intended,
before two days more had passed.
Shortly before noon they came upon lower ground, with the high hills
rising some ten miles farther on. A stream trickled through beds
of reeds and swamp-grass, and it was decided that they should follow
the high ground upstream, in the hope of being thus led to their
hard-sought goal.
Schoverling and Charlie employed the shotgun in turn, shooting from
their horses, and stocking the whole camp with wildfowl.Talks
much of his neglecting the King; and making the King to trot every day to
him, when he is well enough to go to visit his cozen Chief-Justice Hide,
but not to the Council or King.  He commends my Lord of Ormond mightily in
Ireland; but cries out cruelly of Sir G. Lane for his corruption; and that
he hath done my Lord great dishonour by selling of places here, which are
now all taken away, and the poor wretches ready to starve.  That nobody
almost understands or judges of business better than the King, if he would
not be guilty of his father's fault to be doubtfull of himself, and easily
be removed from his own opinion.  That my Lord Lauderdale is never from
the King's care nor council, and that he is a most cunning fellow.  Upon
the whole, that he finds things go very bad every where; and even in the
Council nobody minds the publique.

3rd.  Up pretty early and so to the office, where we sat all the morning
making a very great contract with Sir W. Warren for provisions for the
yeare coming, and so home to dinner, and there was W. Howe come to dine
with me, and before dinner he and I walked in the garden, and we did
discourse together, he assuring me of what he told me the other day of my
Lord's speaking so highly in my commendation to my Lord Peterborough and
Povy, which speaks my Lord having yet a good opinion of me, and also how
well my Lord and Lady both are pleased with their children's being at my
father's, and when the bigger ladies were there a little while ago, at
which I am very glad.  After dinner he went away, I having discoursed with
him about his own proceedings in his studies, and I observe him to be very
considerate and to mind his book in order to preferring himself by my
Lord's favour to something, and I hope to the outing of Creed in his
Secretaryship.  For he tells me that he is confident my Lord do not love
him nor will trust him in any secret matter, he is so cunning and crafty
in all he do.  So my wife and I out of doors thinking to have gone to have
seen a play, but when we came to take coach, they tell us there are none
this week, being the first of Lent.  But, Lord! to see how impatient I
found myself within to see a play, I being at liberty once a month to see
one, and I think it is the best method I could have taken. But to my
office, did very much business with several people till night, and so
home, being unwilling to stay late because of my eye which is not yet well
of the rheum that is fallen down into it, but to supper and to bed.

4th.  Up, my eye being pretty well, and then by coach to my Lord Sandwich,
with whom I spoke, walking a good while with him in his garden, which and
the house is very fine, talking of my Lord Peterborough's accounts,
wherein he is concerned both for the foolery as also inconvenience which
may happen upon my Lord Peterborough's ill-stating of his matters, so as
to have his gaine discovered unnecessarily.  We did talk long and freely
that I hope the worst is past and all will be well. There were several
people by trying a new-fashion gun

     [Many attempts to produce a satisfactory revolver were made in
     former centuries, but it was not till the present one that Colt's
     revolver was invented.  On February 18th, 1661, Edward, Marquis of
     Worcester, obtained Letters Patent for "an invencon to make certeyne
     guns or pistolls which in the tenth parte of one minute of an houre
     may, with a flaske contrived to that purpose, be re-charged the
     fourth part of one turne of the barrell which remaines still fixt,
     fastening it as forceably and effectually as a dozen thrids of any
     scrue, which in the ordinary and usual way require as many turnes."
     On March 3rd, 1664, Abraham Hill obtained Letters Patent for a "gun
     or pistoll for small shott, carrying seaven or eight charges of the
     same in the stocke of the gun."]

brought my Lord this morning, to shoot off often, one after another,
without trouble or danger, very pretty.  Thence to the Temple, and there
taking White's boat down to Woolwich, taking Mr. Shish at Deptford in my
way, with whom I had some good discourse of the Navy business.  At
Woolwich discoursed with him and Mr. Pett about iron worke and other
businesses, and then walked home, and at Greenwich did observe the
foundation laying of a very great house for the King, which will cost a
great deale of money.

     [Building by John Webb; now a part of Greenwich Hospital.  Evelyn
     wrote in his Diary, October 19th, 1661: "I went to London to visite
     my Lord of Bristoll, having been with Sir John Denham (his Mates
     surveyor) to consult with him about the placing of his palace at
     Greenwich, which I would have had built between the river and the
     Queene's house, so as a large cutt should have let in ye Thames like
     a bay; but Sir John was for setting it in piles at the very brink of
     the water, which I did not assent to and so came away, knowing Sir
     John to be a better poet than architect, tho' he had Mr. Webb (Inigo
     Jones's man) to assist him."]

So home to dinner, and my uncle Wight coming in he along with my wife and
I by coach, and setting him down by the way going to Mr. Maes we two to my
Lord Sandwich's to visit my Lady, with whom I left my wife discoursing,
and I to White Hall, and there being met by the Duke of Yorke, he called
me to him and discoursed a pretty while with me about the new ship's
dispatch building at Woolwich, and talking of the charge did say that he
finds always the best the most cheape, instancing in French guns, which in
France you may buy for 4 pistoles, as good to look to as others of 16, but
not the service.  I never had so much discourse with the Duke before, and
till now did ever fear to meet him.  He found me and Mr. Prin together
talking of the Chest money, which we are to blame not to look after.
Thence to my Lord's, and took up my wife, whom my Lady hath received with
her old good nature and kindnesse, and so homewards, and she home, I
'lighting by the way, and upon the 'Change met my uncle Wight and told him
my discourse this afternoon with Sir G. Carteret in Maes' business, but
much to his discomfort, and after a dish of coffee home, and at my office
a good while with Sir W. Warren talking with great pleasure of many
businesses, and then home to supper, my wife and I had a good fowle to
supper, and then I to the office again and so home, my mind in great ease
to think of our coming to so good a respect with my Lord again, and my
Lady, and that my Lady do so much cry up my father's usage of her
children, and the goodness of the ayre there, found in the young ladies'
faces at their return thence, as she says, as also my being put into the
commission of the Fishery,

     [There had been recently established, under the Great Seal of
     England, a Corporation for the Royal Fishing, of which the Duke of
     York was Governor, Lord Craven Deputy-Governor, and the Lord Mayor
     and Chamberlain of London, for the time being, Treasurers, in which
     body was vested the sole power of licensing lotteries ("The Newes,"
     October 6th, 1664).  The original charter (dated April 8th, 1664),
     incorporating James, Duke of York, and thirty-six assistants as
     Governor and Company of the Royal Fishing of Great Britain and
     Ireland, is among the State Papers.  The duke was to be Governor
     till February 26th, 1665]

for which I must give my Lord thanks, and so home to bed, having a great
cold in my head and throat tonight from my late cutting my hair so close
to my head, but I hope it will be soon gone again.

5th.  Up and to the office, where, though I had a great cold, I was forced
to speak much upon a publique meeting of the East India Company, at our
office; where our own company was full, and there was also my Lord George
Barkeley, in behalfe of the company of merchants (I suppose he is on that
company), who, hearing my name, took notice of me, and condoled my cozen
Edward Pepys's death, not knowing whose son I was, nor did demand it of
me.  We broke up without coming to any conclusion, for want of my Lord
Marlborough.  We broke up and I to the 'Change, where with several people
and my uncle Wight to drink a dish of coffee, and so home to dinner, and
then to the office all the afternoon, my eye and my throat being very bad,
and my cold increasing so as I could not speak almost at all at night.  So
at night home to supper, that is a posset, and to bed.

6th (Lord's day).  Up, and my cold continuing in great extremity I could
not go out to church, but sat all day (a little time at dinner excepted)
in my closet at the office till night drawing up a second letter to Mr.
Coventry about the measure of masts to my great satisfaction, and so in
the evening home, and my uncle and aunt Wight came to us and supped with
us, where pretty merry, but that my cold put me out of humour.  At night
with my cold, and my eye also sore still, to bed.

7th.  Up betimes, and the Duke being gone abroad to-day, as we heard by a
messenger, I spent the morning at my office writing fair my yesterday's
work till almost 2 o'clock (only Sir G. Carteret coming I went down a
little way by water towards Deptford, but having more mind to have my
business done I pretended business at the 'Change, and so went into
another boat), and then, eating a bit, my wife and I by coach to the
Duke's house, where we saw "The Unfortunate Lovers;" but I know not
whether I am grown more curious than I was or no, but I was not much
pleased with it, though I know not where to lay the fault, unless it was
that the house was very empty, by reason of a new play at the other house.
Yet here was my Lady Castlemayne in a box, and it was pleasant to hear an
ordinary lady hard by us, that it seems did not know her before, say,
being told who she was, that "she was well enough."  Thence home, and I
ended and sent away my letter to Mr. Coventry (having first read it and
had the opinion of Sir W. Warren in the case), and so home to supper and
to bed, my cold being pretty well gone, but my eye remaining still snare
and rhumey, which I wonder at, my right eye ayling nothing.

8th.  XXVIII. Now for providing these nourishments the strength of each
individual would hardly suffice, if men did not lend one another mutual
aid. But money has furnished us with a token for everything: hence it is
with the notion of money, that the mind of the multitude is chiefly
engrossed: nay, it can hardly conceive any kind of pleasure, which is not
accompanied with the idea of money as cause.

XXIX. This result is the fault only of those, who seek money, not from
poverty or to supply their necessary, wants, but because they, have
learned the arts of gain, wherewith they bring themselves to great
splendour. Certainly they nourish their bodies, according to custom, but
scantily, believing that they lose as much of their wealth as they
spend on the preservation of their body. But they who know the true use of
money, and who fix the measure of wealth solely with regard to their
actual needs, live content with little.

XXX. As, therefore, those things are good which assist the various
parts of the body, and enable them to perform their functions; and as
pleasure consists in an increase of, or aid to, man's power, in so far as
he is composed of mind and body; it follows that all those things which
bring pleasure are good. But seeing that things do not work with the
object of giving us pleasure, and that their power of action is
not tempered to suit our advantage, and, lastly, that pleasure is generally
referred to one part of the body more than to the other parts; therefore
most emotions of pleasure (unless reason and watchfulness be at
hand), and consequently the desires arising therefrom, may become excessive.
Moreover we may add that emotion leads us to pay most regard to what is
agreeable in the present, nor can we estimate what is future with
emotions equally vivid. (IV:xliv.Note, and IV:lx.Note.)
XXXI. Superstition, on the other hand, seems to account as good all
that brings pain, and as bad all that brings pleasure.Walked
home, calling to see my brother Tom, who is in bed, and I doubt very ill
of a consumption.  To the office awhile, and so home to supper and to bed.

9th.  Up pretty betimes to my office, where all day long, but a little at
home at dinner, at my office finishing all things about Mr. Wood's
contract for masts, wherein I am sure I shall save the King L400 before I
have done.  At night home to supper and to bed.

10th.  Up and to the office, where all the morning doing business, and at
noon to the 'Change and there very busy, and so home to dinner with my
wife, to a good hog's harslet,

     [Harslet or haslet, the entrails of an animal, especially of a hog,
     as the heart, liver, &c.]

a piece of meat I love, but have not eat of I think these seven years, and
after dinner abroad by coach set her at Mrs. Hunt's and I to White Hall,
and at the Privy Seale I enquired, and found the Bill come for the
Corporation of the Royall Fishery; whereof the Duke of Yorke is made
present Governor, and several other very great persons, to the number of
thirty-two, made his assistants for their lives: whereof, by my Lord
Sandwich's favour, I am one; and take it not only as a matter of honour,
but that, that may come to be of profit to me, and so with great content
went and called my wife, and so home and to the office, where busy late,
and so home to supper and to bed.

11th.  Up and by coach to my Lord Sandwich's, who not being up I staid
talking with Mr. Moore till my Lord was ready and come down, and went
directly out without calling for me or seeing any body.  I know not
whether he knew I was there, but I am apt to think not, because if he
would have given me that slighting yet he would not have done it to others
that were there.  So I went back again doing nothing but discoursing with
Mr. Moore, who I find by discourse to be grown rich, and indeed not to use
me at all with the respect he used to do, but as his equal.  He made me
known to their Chaplin, who is a worthy, able man. Thence home, and by and
by to the Coffee-house, and thence to the 'Change, and so home to dinner,
and after a little chat with my wife to the office, where all the
afternoon till very late at the office busy, and so home to supper and to
bed, hoping in God that my diligence, as it is really very useful for the
King, so it will end in profit to myself. In the meantime I have good
content in mind to see myself improve every day in knowledge and being
known.

12th.  Lay long pleasantly entertaining myself with my wife, and then up
and to the office, where busy till noon, vexed to see how Sir J. Minnes
deserves rather to be pitied for his dotage and folly than employed at a
great salary to ruin the King's business.  At noon to the 'Change, and
thence home to dinner, and then down to Deptford, where busy a while, and
then walking home it fell hard a raining.  So at Halfway house put in, and
there meeting Mr. Stacy with some company of pretty women, I took him
aside to a room by ourselves, and there talked with him about the several
sorts of tarrs, and so by and by parted, and I walked home and there late
at the office, and so home to supper and to bed.

13th (Lord's day).  Schoverling peered through his glasses as the sun sank
below the hills. "No trees on it, but you can make out the ruins of the
place that Mowbray burned. We'll have to make sure the oxen can get
across that thirty yards of water, too."
Von Hofe and Gholab Singh were on guard that night, but the dawn came without
any disturbance. The first move was to make sure that the cattle and wagon
could get across the strip of water to the island; if not, then all their
plans would have to be changed. Fortunately, they had met with no crocodiles
in the country.

Schoverling and the boys, right after breakfast, rode down to the shore.
The burned patch of reeds had left the lake clear before them, and as they
urged the reluctant horses down into the water, they were gratified to
find that it was shallow--at the deepest part there was only three feet
of water. Without returning, they shouted to Gholab to lead on, for the
bottom was sandy and strewn, with small rocks.

On these one of the oxen went down, but without injury. With the Masai
tugging at the wheels to help, the wagon soon rolled up on the shore
where the three were waiting, and they turned to look ahead. The island
seemed bare of trees, which fact was explained later; only thorn-bushes
clustered around them, the ground gently rising.

"There's the stronghold Mowbray talked about," exclaimed Charlie as they
urged their horses to the crest of the little rise on the bank. Ahead
of them lay the ruins of a burned building, black and desolate. Others
could be seen behind, while around the first was a ring of half-burned
stakes that had at one time formed a strong palisade of heavy timbers.

"We'd better keep out o' there," said Schoverling. "Here's a good place
for the outspanning, just at the bank. Bakari, better get a thorn fence
up right away. There's no telling what's liable to happen here, and we can
command the shore at all events."
"Why can't we take a look around inside?" queried Jack, somewhat puzzled.
"There's no sign of any animals around."
"Plague," returned the explorer briefly. "First thing we do, we must go
back and get in some game. The Masai only got one impalla buck yesterday,
and we can't run short on grub."
With no disappointment the boys gazed over the blackened ruins
before them.

At one time these must have formed a stronghold indeed. Signs of a
"corduroy" road for wagons led down to the water; a clear spring bubbled
out cold and refreshing from inside the compound and ran on past their
camping-place; and the sturdy palisade had resisted even the fire.
Charlie looked regretfully at the huge gate-posts, each nearly three
feet thick and planted solidly in the ground.

"Well, the sooner we do the shooting the sooner we can dig," he sighed,
and turned to the horses. The three gun-bearers had old Snider rifles
of their own, which so far had not come into use, and these they left with
the doctor and Gholab, carrying the 30-30s as had been their custom
during the march.

It was still an hour before noon, and by midday they had shot two impalla,
which with four hartebeest made up all the game they could carry back.
No signs of danger were seen on that short excursion, although once a lion
broke cover and trotted away ahead of them. The boys could see no sign of
elephant with their glasses.

"He's around," laughed Schoverling to their expressions of doubt. "An old
rogue will stay hidden away until he makes up his mind to wipe the earth
with whomever's around. When we get ready to go after him, you'll have
your hands full." Which statement later turned into a very true prophecy.

They rode back to camp to find the zareba done, and von Hofe
standing before the charred gate-posts, hands on hips. He turned at their
laughter and smiled.

"But yes," he retorted to their jokes as they surrounded him, "I too have
the treasure-hunt fever got! Yet is there one question which puzzles me,
my friends!"
"What's that?" laughed Charlie.

"The letter said 'under the left gate post.' Now, when you face the
burned buildings here, this one is the left; but when you turn
around, it becomes the right!"
"Well, we'll tackle that one first," smiled the explorer. "But we'll
have to satisfy Gholab before we do anything else. Impalla steak
would taste pretty good right now, to me."
None the less, the boys were too hungry to do much speculating over
the treasure, eager though they were. Half an hour later, over their
tea, a council was held as to just how to get at the cache. Spades
they had none, and the spears and swords of the Masai were not
fitted for digging.
"Listen," said Jack impatiently. "Mowbray said he located the cache,
didn't he? Well, at best, he had only a few hours over here. When
he burned down the place the smoke kept him from knowing that his
Arabs had lit out. That stands to reason. He didn't have time to
dig around; he knew right where that stuff was hid, and he went for
it. If he found it, the earth would still be pretty loose where he
dug."Being broke up I followed my Lord
Sandwich and thanked him for his putting me into the Fishery, which I
perceive he expected, and cried "Oh!" says he, "in the Fishery you mean.
I told you I would remember you in it," but offered no other discourse.
But demanding whether he had any commands for me, methought he cried "No!"
as if he had no more mind to discourse with me, which still troubles me
and hath done all the day, though I think I am a fool for it, in not
pursuing my resolution of going handsome in clothes and looking high, for
that must do it when all is done with my Lord.  Thence by coach with Sir
W. Batten to the city, and his son Castle, who talks mighty highly against
Captain Tayler, calling him knave, and I find that the old Boating father
is led and talks just as the son do, or the son as the father would have
him. 'Light and to Mr. Moxon's, and there saw our office globes in doing,
which will be very handsome but cost money.  So to the Coffee-house, and
there very fine discourse with Mr. Hill the merchant, a pretty, gentile,
young, and sober man.  So to the 'Change, and thence home, where my wife
and I fell out about my not being willing to have her have her gowne
laced, but would lay out the same money and more on a plain new one.  At
this she flounced away in a manner I never saw her, nor which I could ever
endure.  So I away to the office, though she had dressed herself to go see
my Lady Sandwich.  She by and by in a rage follows me, and coming to me
tells me in spitefull manner like a vixen and with a look full of rancour
that she would go buy a new one and lace it and make me pay for it, and
then let me burn it if I would after she had done it, and so went away in
a fury.  This vexed me cruelly, but being very busy I had, not hand to
give myself up to consult what to do in it, but anon, I suppose after she
saw that I did not follow her, she came again to the office, where I made
her stay, being busy with another, half an houre, and her stomach coming
down we were presently friends, and so after my business being over at the
office we out and by coach to my Lady Sandwich's, with whom I left my
wife, and I to White Hall, where I met Mr. Delsety, and after an hour's
discourse with him met with nobody to do other business with, but back
again to my Lady, and after half an hour's discourse with her to my
brother's, who I find in the same or worse condition.  The doctors give
him over and so do all that see him. He talks no sense two, words together
now; and I confess it made me weepe to see that he should not be able,
when I asked him, to say who I was. I went to Mrs. Turner's, and by her
discourse with my brother's Doctor, Mr. Powell, I find that she is full
now of the disease which my brother is troubled with, and talks of it
mightily, which I am sorry for, there being other company,  but methinks
it should be for her honour to forbear talking of it, the shame of this
very thing I confess troubles me as much as anything.  Back to my
brother's and took my wife, and carried her to my uncle Fenner's and there
had much private discourse with him.  He tells me of the Doctor's thoughts
of my brother's little hopes of recovery, and from that to tell me his
thoughts long of my brother's bad husbandry, and from that to say that he
believes he owes a great deal of money, as to my cozen Scott I know not
how much, and Dr. Thos. Pepys L30, but that the Doctor confesses that he
is paid L20 of it, and what with that and what he owes my father and me I
doubt he is in a very sad condition, that if he lives he will not be able
to show his head, which will be a very great shame to me.  After this I
went in to my aunt and my wife and Anthony Joyce and his wife, who were by
chance there, and drank and so home, my mind and head troubled, but I hope
it will [be] over in a little time one way or other.  After doing a little
at my office of business I home to supper and to bed.  From notice that my
uncle Fenner did give my father the last week of my brother's condition,
my mother is coming up to towne, which also do trouble me.  The business
between my Lords Chancellor and Bristoll, they say, is hushed up; and the
latter gone or going, by the King's licence, to France.

15th.  Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon
comes Madam Turner and her daughter The., her chief errand to tell me that
she had got Dr. Wiverly, her Doctor, to search my brother's mouth, where
Mr. Powell says there is an ulcer, from thence he concludes that he hath
had the pox.  But the Doctor swears that there is not, nor ever was any,
and my brother being very sensible, which I was glad to hear, he did talk
with him about it, and he did wholly disclaim that ever he had the
disease, or that ever he said to Powell that he had it.  All which did put
me into great comfort as to the reproach which was spread against him.  So
I sent for a barrel of oysters, and they dined, and we were very merry, I
being willing to be so upon this news.  After dinner we took coach and to
my brother's, where contrary to my expectation he continues as bad or
worse, talking idle, and now not at all knowing any of us as before.  Here
we staid a great while, I going up and down the house looking after
things.  In the evening Dr. Wiverley came again, and I sent for Mr. Powell
(the Doctor and I having first by ourselves searched my brother again at
his privities, where he was as clear as ever he was born, and in the
Doctor's opinion had been ever so), and we three alone discoursed the
business, where the coxcomb did give us his simple reasons for what he had
said, which the Doctor fully confuted, and left the fellow only saying
that he should cease to report any such thing, and that what he had said
was the best of his judgment from my brother's words and a ulcer, as he
supposed, in his mouth.  I threatened him that I would have satisfaction
if I heard any more such discourse, and so good night to them two, giving
the Doctor a piece for his fee, but the other nothing.  I to my brother
again, where Madam Turner and her company, and Mrs. Croxton, my wife, and
Mrs. Holding.  About 8 o'clock my brother began to fetch his spittle with
more pain, and to speak as much but not so distinctly, till at last the
phlegm getting the mastery of him, and he beginning as we thought to
rattle, I had no mind to see him die, as we thought he presently would,
and so withdrew and led Mrs. Turner home, but before I came back, which
was in half a quarter of an hour, my brother was dead.  I went up and
found the nurse holding his eyes shut, and he poor wretch lying with his
chops fallen, a most sad sight, and that which put me into a present very
great transport of grief and cries, and indeed it was a most sad sight to
see the poor wretch lie now still and dead, and pale like a stone.  I
staid till he was almost cold, while Mrs. Croxton, Holden, and the rest
did strip and lay him out, they observing his corpse, as they told me
afterwards, to be as clear as any they ever saw, and so this was the end
of my poor brother, continuing talking idle and his lips working even to
his last that his phlegm hindered his breathing, and at last his breath
broke out bringing a flood of phlegm and stuff out with it, and so he
died.  This evening he talked among other talk a great deal of French very
plain and good, as, among others: 'quand un homme boit quand il n'a poynt
d'inclination a boire il ne luy fait jamais de bien.'  I once begun to
tell him something of his condition, and asked him whither he thought he
should go.  He in distracted manner answered me--"Why, whither should I
go? there are but two ways: If I go, to the bad way I must give God thanks
for it, and if I go the other way I must give God the more thanks for it;
and I hope I have not been so undutifull and unthankfull in my life but I
hope I shall go that way."  This was all the sense, good or bad, that I
could get of him this day.  I left my wife to see him laid out, and I by
coach home carrying my brother's papers, all I could find, with me, and
having wrote a letter to, my father telling him what hath been said I
returned by coach, it being very late, and dark, to my brother's, but all
being gone, the corpse laid out, and my wife at Mrs. Turner's, I thither,
and there after an hour's talk, we up to bed, my wife and I in the little
blue chamber, and I lay close to my wife, being full of disorder and grief
for my brother that I could not sleep nor wake with satisfaction, at last
I slept till 5 or 6 o'clock.

16th.  And then I rose and up, leaving my wife in bed, and to my
brother's, where I set them on cleaning the house, and my wife coming anon
to look after things, I up and down to my cozen Stradwicke's and uncle
Fenner's about discoursing for the funeral, which I am resolved to put off
till Friday next.  Thence home and trimmed myself, and then to the
'Change, and told my uncle Wight of my brother's death, and so by coach to
my cozen Turner's and there dined very well, but my wife .  .  . .  in
great pain we were forced to rise in some disorder, and in Mrs. Turner's
coach carried her home and put her to bed.  Then back again with my cozen
Norton to Mrs. Turner's, and there staid a while talking with Dr. Pepys,
the puppy, whom I had no patience to hear.  So I left them and to my
brother's to look after things, and saw the coffin brought; and by and by
Mrs. Holden came and saw him nailed up.  Then came W. Joyce to me half
drunk, and much ado I had to tell him the story of my brother's being
found clear of what was said, but he would interrupt me by some idle
discourse or other, of his crying what a good man, and a good speaker my
brother was, and God knows what.  At last weary of him I got him away, and
I to Mrs. Turner's, and there, though my heart is still heavy to think of
my poor brother, yet I could give way to my fancy to hear Mrs. The. play
upon the Harpsicon, though the musique did not please me neither.  Thence
to my brother's and found them with my mayd Elizabeth taking an inventory
of the goods of the house, which I was well pleased at, and am much
beholden to Mr. Honeywood's man in doing of it.  His name is Herbert, one
that says he knew me when he lived with Sir Samuel Morland, but I have
forgot him.  So I left them at it, and by coach home and to my office,
there to do a little business, but God knows my heart and head is so full
of my brother's death, and the consequences of it, that I can do very
little or understand it.  So home to supper, and after looking over some
business in my chamber I to bed to my wife, who continues in bed in some
pain still.  This day I have a great barrel of oysters given me by Mr.
Barrow, as big as 16 of others, and I took it in the coach with me to Mrs.
Turner's, and give them to her.  This day the Parliament met again, after
a long prorogation, but what they have done I have not been in the way to
hear.

17th.  Up and to my brother's, where all the morning doing business
against to-morrow, and so to my cozen Stradwicke's about the same
business, and to the 'Change, and thence home to dinner, where my wife in
bed sick still, but not so bad as yesterday.  I dined by her, and so to
the office, where we sat this afternoon, having changed this day our
sittings from morning to afternoons, because of the Parliament which
returned yesterday; but was adjourned till Monday next; upon pretence that
many of the members were said to be upon the road; and also the King had
other affairs, and so desired them to adjourn till then.  But the truth
is, the King is offended at my Lord of Bristol, as they say, whom he hath
found to have been all this while (pretending a desire of leave to go into
France, and to have all the difference between him and the Chancellor made
up,) endeavouring to make factions in both Houses to the Chancellor.  So
the King did this to keep the Houses from meeting; and in the meanwhile
sent a guard and a herald last night to have taken him at Wimbleton, where
he was in the morning, but could not find him: at which the King was and
is still mightily concerned, and runs up and down to and from the
Chancellor's like a boy: and it seems would make Digby's articles against
the Chancellor to be treasonable reflections against his Majesty.  So that
the King is very high, as they say; and God knows what will follow upon
it!  After office I to my brother's again, and thence to Madam Turner's,
in both places preparing things against to-morrow; and this night I have
altered my resolution of burying him in the church yarde among my young
brothers and sisters, and bury him in the church, in the middle isle, as
near as I can to my mother's pew.  This costs me 20s. more.  This being
all, home by coach, bringing my brother's silver tankard for safety along
with me, and so to supper, after writing to my father, and so to bed.

18th.  Up betimes, and walked to my brother's, where a great while putting
things in order against anon; then to Madam Turner's and eat a breakfast
there, and so to Wotton, my shoemaker, and there got a pair of shoes
blacked on the soles against anon for me; so to my brother's and to
church, and with the grave-maker chose a place for my brother to lie in,
just under my mother's pew.  But to see how a man's tombes are at the
mercy of such a fellow, that for sixpence he would, (as his owne words
were,) "I will justle them together but I will make room for him;"
speaking of the fulness of the middle isle, where he was to lie; and that
he would, for my father's sake, do my brother that is dead all the
civility he can; which was to disturb other corps that are not quite
rotten, to make room for him; and methought his manner of speaking it was
very remarkable; as of a thing that now was in his power to do a man a
courtesy or not.  At noon my wife, though in pain, comes, but I being
forced to go home, she went back with me, where I dressed myself, and so
did Besse; and so to my brother's again: whither, though invited, as the
custom is, at one or two o'clock, they came not till four or five.  But at
last one after another they come, many more than I bid: and my reckoning
that I bid was one hundred and twenty; but I believe there was nearer one
hundred and fifty.  Their service was six biscuits apiece, and what they
pleased of burnt claret.  My cosen Joyce Norton kept the wine and cakes
above; and did give out to them that served, who had white gloves given
them.  But above all, I am beholden to Mrs. Holden, who was most kind, and
did take mighty pains not only in getting the house and every thing else
ready, but this day in going up and down to see, the house filled and
served, in order to mine, and their great content, I think; the men
sitting by themselves in some rooms, and women by themselves in others,
very close, but yet room enough.  Anon to church, walking out into the
streete to the Conduit, and so across the streete, and had a very good
company along with the corps.  And being come to the grave as above, Dr.
Pierson, the minister of the parish, did read the service for buriall: and
so I saw my poor brother laid into the grave; and so all broke up; and I
and my wife and Madam Turner and her family to my brother's, and by and by
fell to a barrell of oysters, cake, and cheese, of Mr. Honiwood's, with
him, in his chamber and below, being too merry for so late a sad work.
But, Lord! to see how the world makes nothing of the memory of a man, an
houre after he is dead!  And, indeed, I must blame myself; for though at
the sight of him dead and dying, I had real grief for a while, while he
was in my sight, yet presently after, and ever since, I have had very
little grief indeed for him.  By and by, it beginning to be late, I put
things in some order in the house, and so took my wife and Besse (who hath
done me very good service in cleaning and getting ready every thing and
serving the wine and things to-day, and is indeed a most excellent
good-natured and faithful wench, and I love her mightily), by coach home,
and so after being at the office to set down the day's work home to supper
and to bed.

19th.  Up and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon my wife
and I alone, having a good hen, with eggs, to dinner, with great content.
Then by coach to my brother's, where I spent the afternoon in paying some
of the charges of the buriall, and in looking over his papers, among which
I find several letters of my brother John's to him speaking very foale
words of me and my deportment to him here, and very crafty designs about
Sturtlow land and God knows what, which I am very glad to know, and shall
make him repent them.  Anon my father and my brother John came to towne by
coach.  I sat till night with him, giving him an account of things.  He,
poor man, very sad and sickly.  I in great pain by a simple compressing of
my cods to-day by putting one leg over another as I have formerly done,
which made me hasten home, and after a little at the office in great
disorder home to bed.

20th (Lord's day).  Kept my bed all the morning, having laid a poultice to
my cods last night to take down the tumour there which I got yesterday,
which it did do, being applied pretty warm, and soon after the beginning
of the swelling, and the pain was gone also.  We lay talking all the
while, among other things of religion, wherein I am sorry so often to hear
my wife talk of her being and resolving to die a Catholique,

     [Mrs. Pepys's leaning towards Roman Catholicism was a constant
     trouble to her husband; but, in spite of his fears, she died a
     Protestant (Dr. Milles's certificate.)]

and indeed a small matter, I believe, would absolutely turn her, which I
am sorry for.  Up at noon to dinner, and then to my chamber with a fire
till late at night looking over my brother Thomas's papers, sorting of
them, among which I find many base letters of my brother John's to him
against me, and carrying on plots against me to promote Tom's having of
his Banbury' Mistress, in base slighting terms, and in worse of my sister
Pall, such as I shall take a convenient time to make my father know, and
him also to his sorrow.  So after supper to bed, our people rising to wash
to-morrow.

21st.  Up, and it snowing this morning a little, which from the mildness
of the winter and the weather beginning to be hot and the summer to come
on apace, is a little strange to us.  I did not go abroad for fear of my
tumour, for fear it shall rise again, but staid within, and by and by my,
father came, poor man, to me, and my brother John.  After much talke and
taking them up to my chamber, I did there after some discourse bring in
any business of anger--with John, and did before my father read all his
roguish letters, which troubled my father mightily, especially to hear me
say what I did, against my allowing any thing for the time to come to him
out of my owne purse, and other words very severe, while he, like a simple
rogue, made very silly and churlish answers to me, not like a man of any
goodness or witt, at which I was as much disturbed as the other, and will
be as good as my word in making him to his cost know that I will remember
his carriage to me in this particular the longest day I live. It troubled
me to see my poor father so troubled, whose good nature did make him, poor
wretch, to yield, I believe, to comply with my brother Tom and him in part
of their designs, but without any ill intent to me, or doubt of me or my
good intentions to him or them, though it do trouble me a little that he
should in any manner do it.  They dined with me, and after dinner abroad
with my wife to buy some things for her, and I to the office, where we sat
till night, and then, after doing some business at my closet, I home and
to supper and to bed.  This day the Houses of Parliament met; and the King
met them, with the Queene with him.  And he made a speech to them:

     [March 16th, 1663-64.  This day both Houses met, and on the gist the
     king opened the session with a speech from the throne, in which
     occurs this Passage: "I pray, Mr. Speaker, and you, gentlemen of the
     House of Commons, give that Triennial Bill once a reading in your
     house, and then, in God's name, do what you think fit for me and
     yourselves and the whole kingdom.  I need not tell you how much I
     love parliaments.  Never king was so much beholden to parliaments as
     I have been, nor do I think the crown can ever be happy without
     frequent parliaments" (Cobbett's "Parliamentary History," vol. iv.,
     cc. 290, 291).]

among other things, discoursing largely of the plots abroad against him
and the peace of the kingdom; and, among other things, that the
dissatisfied party had great hopes upon the effect of the Act for a
Triennial Parliament granted by his father, which he desired them to
peruse, and, I think, repeal.  So the Houses did retire to their own
House, and did order the Act to be read to-morrow before them; and I
suppose it will be repealed, though I believe much against the will of a
good many that sit there.

22nd.  Up, and spent the whole morning and afternoon at my office, only in
the evening, my wife being at my aunt Wight's, I went thither, calling at
my own house, going out found the parlour curtains drawn, and inquiring
the reason of it, they told me that their mistress had got Mrs. Buggin's
fine little dog and our little bitch, which is proud at this time, and I
am apt to think that she was helping him to line her, for going afterwards
to my uncle Wight's, and supping there with her, where very merry with Mr.
Woolly's drollery, and going home I found the little dog so little that of
himself he could not reach our bitch, which I am sorry for, for it is the
finest dog that ever I saw in my life, as if he were painted the colours
are so finely mixed and shaded.  God forgive me, it went against me to
have my wife and servants look upon them while they endeavoured to do
something .  .  .  .

23rd.  Up, and going out saw Mrs. Buggin's dog, which proves as I thought
last night so pretty that I took him and the bitch into my closet below,
and by holding down the bitch helped him to line her, which he did very
stoutly, so as I hope it will take, for it is the prettiest dog that ever
I saw.  So to the office, where very busy all the morning, and so to the
'Change, and off hence with Sir W. Rider to the Trinity House, and there
dined very well: and good discourse among the old men of Islands now and
then rising and falling again in the Sea, and that there is many dangers
of grounds and rocks that come just up to the edge almost of the sea, that
is never discovered and ships perish without the world's knowing the
reason of it.  Among other things, they observed, that there are but two
seamen in the Parliament house, viz., Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen, and
not above twenty or thirty merchants; which is a strange thing in an
island, and no wonder that things of trade go no better nor are better
understood.  Thence home, and all the afternoon at the office, only for an
hour in the evening my Lady Jemimah, Paulina, and Madam Pickering come to
see us, but my wife would not be seen, being unready.  Very merry with
them; they mightily talking of their thrifty living for a fortnight before
their mother came to town, and other such simple talk, and of their merry
life at Brampton, at my father's, this winter.  So they being gone, to the
office again till late, and so home and to supper and to bed.

24th.  Called up by my father, poor man, coming to advise with me about
Tom's house and other matters, and he being gone I down by water to
Greenwich, it being very-foggy, and I walked very finely to Woolwich, and
there did very much business at both yards, and thence walked back,
Captain Grove with me talking, and so to Deptford and did the like-there,
and then walked to Redriffe (calling and eating a bit of collops and eggs
at Half-way house), and so home to the office, where we sat late, and home
weary to supper and to bed.

25th (Lady-day).  Up and by water to White Hall, and there to chappell;
where it was most infinite full to hear Dr. Critton.  Being not knowne,
some great persons in the pew I pretended to, and went in, did question my
coming in.  I told them my pretence; so they turned to the orders of the
chappell, which hung behind upon the wall, and read it; and were
satisfied; but they did not demand whether I was in waiting or no; and so
I was in some fear lest he that was in waiting might come and betray me.
For winning love those qualities are especially necessary which have regard
to religion and piety (cf. IV:xxxvii.Notes.i., &.ii.; IV:xlvi.Note;
and IV:lxxiii.Note).

XVI. Further, harmony is often the result of fear: but such harmony is
insecure. Further, fear arises from infirmity of spirit and moreover belongs
not to the exercise of reason: the same is true of compassion, though
this latter seems to bear a certain resemblance to piety.

XVII. Men are also gained over by liberality, especially such as have not
the means to buy what is necessary to sustain life. However, to give aid
to every poor man is far beyond the power and the advantage of any private
person. For the riches of any private person are wholly inadequate to
meet such a call. Again, an individual man's resources of character are
too limited for him to be able to make all men his friends. Hence providing
for the poor is a duty, which falls on the State as a whole, and has
regard only to the general advantage.

     XVIII. In accepting favours, and in returning gratitude our duty
     must be wholly different (cf. IV:lxx.Note; IV:lxxi. Note).
     XIX.

Again, meretricious love, that is, the lust of generation arising from
bodily beauty, and generally every sort of love, which owns anything save
freedom of soul as its cause, readily passes into hate; unless indeed,
what is worse, it is a species of madness; and then it promotes discord
rather than harmony (cf. III:xxxi.Coroll.).

XX. As concerning marriage, it is certain that this is in harmony with
reason, if the desire for physical union be not engendered solely by
bodily beauty, but also by the desire to beget children and to train them
up wisely; and moreover, if the love of both, to wit, of the man and of the
woman, is not caused by bodily beauty only, but also by freedom of soul.

XXI.

Furthermore, flattery begets harmony; but only by means of the vile offence
of slavishness or treachery. None are more readily taken with flattery
than the proud, who wish to be first, but are not.

XXII. There is in abasement a spurious appearance of piety and religion.
Although abasement is the opposite to pride, yet is he that abases
himself most akin to the proud (IV:lvii.Note).

XXIII. Shame also brings about harmony, but only in such matters as cannot
be hid. Further, as shame is a species of pain, it does not concern the
exercise of reason.
XXIV. The remaining emotions of pain towards men are directly opposed to
justice, equity, honour, piety, and religion; and, although indignation
seems to bear a certain resemblance to equity, yet is life but lawless,
where every man may pass judgment on another's deeds, and vindicate
his own or other men's rights.
XXV. Correctness of conduct (modestia), that is, the desire of pleasing
men which is determined by reason, is attributable to piety (as we said
in IV:xxxvii.Note.i.). But, if it spring from emotion, it is ambition,
or the desire whereby, men, under the false cloak of piety, generally stir
up discords and seditions. For he who desires to aid his fellows. either
in word or in deed, so that they may together enjoy the highest good,
he, I say, will before all things strive to, win them over with love: not
to draw them into admiration, so that a system may be called after
his name, nor to give any cause for envy. Further, in his conversation
he will shrink from talking of men's faults, and will be careful to speak
but sparingly of human infirmity: but he will dwell at length on human
virtue or power, and the way whereby it may be perfected. Thus will men
be stirred not by fear, nor by aversion, but only by the emotion of
joy, to endeavour, so far as in them lies, to live in obedience to
reason.
XXVI. Besides men, we know of no particular thing in nature in whose
mind we may rejoice, and whom we can associate with ourselves in
friendship or any sort of fellowship; therefore, whatsoever there
be in nature besides man, a regard for our advantage does not call
on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its
various capabilities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.
XXVII. The advantage which we derive from things external to us,
besides the experience and knowledge which we acquire from observing
them, and from recombining their elements in different forms, is
principally the preservation of the body; from this point of view,
those things are most useful which can so feed and nourish the body,
that all its parts may rightly fulfil their functions.Batten sent to speak with me, and
told me that he had proffered our bill today in the House, and that it was
read without any dissenters, and he fears not but will pass very well,
which I shall be glad of.  He told me also how Sir [Richard] Temple hath
spoke very discontentfull words in the House about the Tryennial Bill; but
it hath been read the second time to-day, and committed; and, he believes,
will go on without more ado, though there are many in the House are
displeased at it, though they dare not say much.  But above all
expectation, Mr. Prin is the man against it, comparing it to the idoll
whose head was of gold, and his body and legs and feet of different metal.
So this Bill had several degrees of calling of Parliaments, in case the
King, and then the Council, and then the Lord Chancellor, and then the
Sheriffes, should fail to do it.  He tells me also, how, upon occasion of
some 'prentices being put in the pillory to-day for beating of their
masters, or some such like thing, in Cheapside, a company of 'prentices
came and rescued them, and pulled down the pillory; and they being set up
again, did the like again.  So that the Lord Mayor and Major Generall
Browne was fain to come and stay there, to keep the peace; and drums, all
up and down the city, was beat to raise the trained bands, for to quiett
the towne, and by and by, going out with my uncle and aunt Wight by coach
with my wife through Cheapside (the rest of the company after much content
and mirth being broke up), we saw a trained band stand in Cheapside upon
their guard.  We went, much against my uncle's will, as far almost as Hyde
Park, he and my aunt falling out all the way about it, which vexed me, but
by this I understand my uncle more than ever I did, for he was mighty soon
angry, and wished a pox take her, which I was sorry to hear.  The weather
I confess turning on a sudden to rain did make it very unpleasant, but yet
there was no occasion in the world for his being so angry, but she bore
herself very discreetly, and I must confess she proves to me much another
woman than I thought her, but all was peace again presently, and so it
raining very fast, we met many brave coaches coming from the Parke and so
we turned and set them down at home, and so we home ourselves, and ended
the day with great content to think how it hath pleased the Lord in six
years time to raise me from a condition of constant and dangerous and most
painfull sicknesse and low condition and poverty to a state of constant
health almost, great honour and plenty, for which the Lord God of heaven
make me truly thankfull.  My wife found her gowne come home laced, which
is indeed very handsome, but will cost me a great deal of money, more than
ever I intended, but it is but for once.  So to the office and did
business, and then home and to bed.

27th (Lord's day).  Lay long in bed wrangling with my wife about the
charge she puts me to at this time for clothes more than I intended, and
very angry we were, but quickly friends again.  And so rising and ready I
to my office, and there fell upon business, and then to dinner, and then
to my office again to my business, and by and by in the afternoon walked
forth towards my father's, but it being church time, walked to St.
James's, to try if I could see the belle Butler, but could not; only saw
her sister, who indeed is pretty, with a fine Roman nose.  Thence walked
through the ducking-pond fields; but they are so altered since my father
used to carry us to Islington, to the old man's, at the King's Head, to
eat cakes and ale (his name was Pitts) that I did not know which was the
ducking-pond nor where I was.  So through F[l]ee[t] lane to my father's,
and there met Mr. Moore, and discoursed with him and my father about who
should administer for my brother Tom, and I find we shall have trouble in
it, but I will clear my hands of it, and what vexed me, my father seemed
troubled that I should seem to rely so wholly upon the advice of Mr.
Moore, and take nobody else, but I satisfied him, and so home; and in
Cheapside, both coming and going, it was full of apprentices, who have
been here all this day, and have done violence, I think, to the master of
the boys that were put in the pillory yesterday. But, Lord! to see how the
train-bands are raised upon this: the drums beating every where as if an
enemy were upon them; so much is this city subject to be put into a
disarray upon very small occasions.  But it was pleasant to hear the boys,
and particularly one little one, that I demanded the business.  He told me
that that had never been done in the city since it was a city, two
prentices put in the pillory, and that it ought not to be so. So I walked
home, and then it being fine moonshine with my wife an houre in the
garden, talking of her clothes against Easter and about her mayds, Jane
being to be gone, and the great dispute whether Besse, whom we both love,
should be raised to be chamber-mayde or no.  We have both a mind to it,
but know not whether we should venture the making her proud and so make a
bad chamber-mayde of a very good natured and sufficient cook-mayde.  So to
my office a little, and then to supper, prayers and to bed.

28th.  This is the first morning that I have begun, and I hope shall
continue to rise betimes in the morning, and so up and to my office, and
thence about 7 o'clock to T. Trice, and advised with him about our
administering to my brother Tom, and I went to my father and told him what
to do; which was to administer and to let my cozen Scott have a letter of
Atturny to follow the business here in his absence for him, who by that
means will have the power of paying himself (which we cannot however
hinder) and do us a kindness we think too.  But, Lord! what a shame,
methinks, to me, that, in this condition, and at this age, I should know
no better the laws of my owne country!  Thence to Westminster Hall, and
spent till noon, it being Parliament time, and at noon walked with Creed
into St. James's Parke, talking of many things, particularly of the poor
parts and great unfitness for business of Mr. Povy, and yet what a show he
makes in the world.  Mr. Coventry not being come to his chamber, I walked
through the house with him for an hour in St. James's fields' talking of
the same subject, and then parted, and back and with great impatience,
sometimes reading, sometimes walking, sometimes thinking that Mr.
Coventry, though he invited us to dinner with him, was gone with the rest
of the office without a dinner.  At last, at past 4 o'clock I heard that
the Parliament was not up yet, and so walked to Westminster Hall, and
there found it so, and meeting with Sir J. Minnes, and being very hungry,
went over with him to the Leg, and before we had cut a bit, the House
rises, however we eat a bit and away to St. James's and there eat a second
part of our dinner with Mr. Coventry and his brother Harry, Sir W. Batten
and Sir W. Pen.  The great matter today in the House hath been, that Mr.
Vaughan, the great speaker, is this day come to towne, and hath declared
himself in a speech of an houre and a half, with great reason and
eloquence, against the repealing of the Bill for Triennial Parliaments;
but with no successe: but the House have carried it that there shall be
such Parliaments, but without any coercive power upon the King, if he will
bring this Act.  But, Lord! to see how the best things are not done
without some design; for I perceive all these gentlemen that I was with
to-day were against it (though there was reason enough on their side); yet
purely, I could perceive, because it was the King's mind to have it; and
should he demand any thing else, I believe they would give it him.  But
this the discontented Presbyters, and the faction of the House will be
highly displeased with; but it was carried clearly against them in the
House.  We had excellent good table-talke, some of which I have entered in
my book of stories.  So with them by coach home, and there find (bye my
wife), that Father Fogourdy hath been with her to-day, and she is mightily
for our going to hear a famous Reule preach at the French Embassador's
house: I pray God he do not tempt her in any matters of religion, which
troubles me; and also, she had messages from her mother to-day, who sent
for her old morning-gown, which was almost past wearing; and I used to
call it her kingdom, from the ease and content she used to have in the
wearing of it.  I am glad I do not hear of her begging any thing of more
value, but I do not like that these messages should now come all upon
Monday morning, when my wife expects of course I should be abroad at the
Duke's.  To the office, where Mr. Norman came and showed me a design of
his for the storekeeper's books, for the keeping of them regular in order
to a balance, which I am mightily satisfied to see, and shall love the
fellow the better, as he is in all things sober, so particularly for his
endeavour to do something in this thing so much wanted.  So late home to
supper and to bed, weary-with walking so long to no purpose in the Park
to-day.

29th.  Was called up this morning by a messenger from Sir G. Carteret to
come to him to Sir W. Batten's, and so I rose and thither to him, and with
him and Sir J. Minnes to, Sir G. Carteret's to examine his accounts, and
there we sat at it all the morning.  About noon Sir W. Batten came from
the House of Parliament and told us our Bill for our office was read the
second time to-day, with great applause, and is committed.  By and by to
dinner, where good cheere, and Sir G. Carteret in his humour a very good
man, and the most kind father and pleased father in his children that ever
I saw.  Here is now hung up a picture of my Lady Carteret, drawn by Lilly,
a very fine picture, but yet not so good as I have seen of his doing.
After dinner to the business again without any intermission till almost
night, and then home, and took coach to my father to see and discourse
with him, and so home again and to my office, where late, and then home to
bed.

30th.  Up very betimes to my office, and thence at 7 o'clock to Sir G.
Carteret, and there with Sir J. Minnes made an end of his accounts, but
staid not dinner, my Lady having made us drink our morning draft there of
several wines, but I drank: nothing but some of her coffee, which was
poorly made, with a little sugar in it.  Thence to the 'Change a great
while, and had good discourse with Captain Cocke at the Coffee-house about
a Dutch warr, and it seems the King's design is by getting underhand the
merchants to bring in their complaints to the Parliament, to make them in
honour begin a warr, which he cannot in honour declare first, for fear
they should not second him with money.  Thence homewards, staying a pretty
while with my little she milliner at the end of Birchin Lane, talking and
buying gloves of her, and then home to dinner, and in the afternoon had a
meeting upon the Chest business, but I fear unless I have time to look
after it nothing will be done,, and that I fear I shall not.  In the
evening comes Sir W. Batten, who tells us that the Committee have approved
of our bill with very few amendments in words, not in matter.  So to my
office, where late with Sir W. Warren, and so home to supper and to bed.

31st.  Up betimes, and to my office, where by and by comes Povy, Sir W.
Rider, Mr. Bland, Creed, and Vernatty, about my Lord Peterborough's
accounts, which we now went through, but with great difficulty, and many
high words between Mr. Povy and I; for I could not endure to see so many
things extraordinary put in, against truthe and reason.  He was very
angry, but I endeavoured all I could to profess my satisfaction in my
Lord's part of the accounts, but not in those foolish idle things, they
say I said, that others had put in.  Anon we rose and parted, both of us
angry, but I contented, because I knew all of them must know I was in the
right.  Then with Creed to Deptford, where I did a great deal of business
enquiring into the business of canvas and other things with great content,
and so walked back again, good discourse between Creed and I by the way,
but most upon the folly of Povy, and at home found Luellin, and so we to
dinner, and thence I to the office, where we sat all the afternoon late,
and being up and my head mightily crowded with business, I took my wife by
coach to see my father.  I left her at his house and went to him to an
alehouse hard by, where my cozen Scott was, and my father's new tenant,
Langford, a tailor, to whom I have promised my custom, and he seems a very
modest, carefull young man.  Thence my wife coming with the coach to the
alley end I home, and after supper to the making up my monthly accounts,
and to my great content find myself worth above L900, the greatest sum I
ever yet had.  Having done my accounts, late to bed.  My head of late
mighty full of business, and with good content to myself in it, though
sometimes it troubles me that nobody else but I should bend themselves to
serve the King with that diligence, whereby much of my pains proves
ineffectual.
