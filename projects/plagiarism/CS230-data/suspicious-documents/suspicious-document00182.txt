THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION

EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE AND PROGRESS CONSIDERED AS A PHASE OF THE DEVELOPMENT
AND SPREAD OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION

BY

ELLWOOD P. CUBBERLEY


TO MY WIFE
FOR THIRTY YEARS BEST OF COMPANIONS IN BOTH WORK AND PLAY


PREFACE


The present volume, as well as the companion volume of _Readings_, arose
out of a practical situation. Twenty-two years ago, on entering Stanford
University as a Professor of Education and being given the history of the
subject to teach, I found it necessary, almost from the first, to begin
the construction of a Syllabus of Lectures which would permit of my
teaching the subject more as a phase of the history of the rise and
progress of our Western civilization than would any existing text. Through
such a study it is possible to give, better than by any other means, that
vision of world progress which throws such a flood of light over all our
educational efforts. The Syllabus grew, was made to include detailed
citations to historical literature, and in 1902 was published in book
form. In 1905 a second and an enlarged edition was issued, [1] and these
volumes for a time formed the basis for classwork and reading in a number
of institutions, and, though now out of print, may still be found in many
libraries. At the same time I began the collection of a series of short,
illustrative sources for my students to read.

It had been my intention, after the publication of the second edition of
the Syllabus, to expand the outline into a Text Book which would embody my
ideas as to what university students should be given as to the history of
the work in which they were engaged. I felt then, and still feel, that the
history of education, properly conceived and presented, should occupy an
important place in the training of an educational leader. Two things now
happened which for some time turned me aside from my original purpose. The
first was the publication, late in 1905, of Paul Monroe's very
comprehensive and scholarly _Text Book in the History of Education_, and
the second was that, with the expansion of the work in education in the
university with which I was connected, and the addition of new men to the
department, the general history of education was for a time turned over to
another to teach. I then began, instead, the development of that
introductory course in education, dealing entirely with American
educational history and problems, out of which grew my _Public Education
in the United States_.

The second half of the academic year 1910-11 I acted as visiting Lecturer
on the History of Education at both Harvard University and Radcliffe
College, and while serving in this capacity I began work on what has
finally evolved into the present volume, together with the accompanying
book of illustrative _Readings_. Other duties, and a deep interest in
problems of school administration, largely engaged my energies and writing
time until some three years ago, when, in rearranging courses at the
university, it seemed desirable that I should again take over the
instruction in the general history of education. Since then I have pushed
through, as rapidly as conditions would permit, the organization of the
parallel book of sources and documents, and the present volume of text.

In doing so I have not tried to prepare another history of educational
theories. Of such we already have a sufficient number. Instead, I have
tried to prepare a history of the progress and practice and organization
of education itself, and to give to such a history its proper setting as a
phase of the history of the development and spread of our Western
civilization. I have especially tried to present such a picture of the
rise, struggle for existence, growth, and recent great expansion of the
idea of the improvability of the race and the elevation and emancipation
of the individual through education as would be most illuminating and
useful to students of the subject. To this end I have traced the great
forward steps in the emancipation of the intellect of man, and the efforts
to perpetuate the progress made through the organization of educational
institutions to pass on to others what had been attained. About 1855,
when she was on a visit to England, through the work of Daniel D. Home,
a notorious American exponent of spiritualism, Mrs. Browning became
interested in the current fad, and gave to it vastly more serious
attention than most other initiates.

Browning himself, while patient, was intolerably irritated with those whom
he regarded as imposing on his wife's credulity, and delivered himself
on the subject in _Mr. Sludge, 'the Medium_.' Spiritualism, however, was
a topic of never-failing interest between Mrs. Browning and her American
friend, Harriet Beecher Stowe, whom she entertained in Italy. _Uncle Tom's
Cabin_ made a profound impression upon her. In 1853 this book was still
in the great flush of its first success. On April 12, 1853, Mrs. Browning
wrote from Florence to Mrs. Jameson as follows:

Not read Mrs. Stowe's book! _But you must_. Her book is quite a sign of
the times, and has otherwise and intrinsically considerable power. For
myself, I rejoice in the success, both as a woman and a human being. Oh,
and is it possible that you think a woman has no business with questions
like the question of slavery? Then she had better use a pen no more. She
had better subside into slavery and concubinage herself, I think,
as in the times of old, shut herself up with the Penelopes in the "women's
apartment," and take no rank among thinkers and speakers.
Certainly you are not in earnest in these things. A difficult question--yes!
All virtue is difficult. England found it difficult. France found it
difficult. But we did not make ourselves an armchair of our sins. As
for America, I honor America in much; but I would not be an American
for the world while she wears that shameful scar upon her brow. The address
of the new president[11] exasperates me. Observe, I am an abolitionist,
not to the fanatical degree, because I hold that compensation should be
given by the North to the South, as in England. The states should unite
in buying off this national disgrace.[12]
Under date Florence, December 11, 1854, Mrs.

Browning wrote to Miss Mitford as follows:

I am reading now Mrs. Stowe's _Sunny Memories_, and like the naturalness
and simplicity of the book much, in spite of the provincialism of the
tone of mind and education, and the really wretched writing.
It's quite wonderful that a woman who has written a book to make the world
ring should write so abominably.[13]
More and more as the Civil War approached was Mrs. Browning depressed by
the thought of the impending conflict. Between June 7, 1860, and July
25, 1861, she contributed to the recently established _Independent_ eleven
poems, chiefly on subjects of Italian liberty.
Sometimes, however, especially in the letters accompanying her poems,
she touched on themes somewhat closer to the American people. For the issue
of March 21, 1861, she wrote to the editor as follows:

My partiality for frenzies is not so absorbing, believe me, as to exclude
very painful consideration on the dissolution of your great Union. But my
serious fear has been, and is, not for the dissolution of the body but the
death of the soul--not of a rupture of states and civil war, but at
reconciliation and peace at the expense of a deadly compromise of
principle. Nothing will destroy the Republic but what corrupts its
conscience and disturbs its fame--for the stain upon the honor must come
off upon the flag.

_If, on the other hand,
the North stands fast on the moral ground, no glory will be like
your glory_....

What surprises me is that the slaves don't rise.

On this great subject Mrs.

Browning
found her husband
in full sympathy with her.

Browning himself declared in a letter
    to an American, September
   11, 1861:

  I have lost the explanation of American affairs, but I assure you
of my belief in the justice and my confidence in the triumph of the
great cause.

For the righteousness of the principle I want
    no information. God prosper it
   and its defenders.[14]
  Two poems by Mrs. Browning at least have
   to do directly with the Negro and American
    affairs.

One was _A Curse for a Nation_ contributed to the _Poems
    before Congress_ volume. The poet begins
   somewhat self-consciously:
  

I heard
an angel speak last
night, And he said "Write!
Write a Nation's curse for me, And send it over the Western Sea."

She protests her unwillingness to execute such a commission, for,
she says,
I am bound by gratitude By love and blood, To brothers of mine
across the sea, Who stretch out kindly hands to me.

The angel, however, beats down this unwillingness
    and the curse follows, the second stanza reading:
Because yourselves are standing straight In the state Of Freedom's
foremost acolyte, Yet keep calm footing all the time On writhing
bond-slaves,--for this crime This is the curse.

Write.
    

At best, however, _A Curse for a Nation_ can hardly help
    impressing one as a little forced.
   In rather higher poetic vein is the
  other poem, _The Runaway Slave at
   Pilgrim's Point_.

This was contributed to _The Liberty Bell_, a publication issued
by the Boston Anti-Slavery Bazar in 1848.

Mrs.
Browning feared that the poem might be "too ferocious
for the Americans to publish." The composition is undoubtedly a strong
one.

It undertakes to give the story of a young Negro woman who was bound
in slavery, whose lover was crushed before her face, who was forced
to submit to personal violation, who killed her child that so much
reminded her of her white master's face, and who at last at Pilgrim's
Point defied her pursuers.

With unusual earnestness the poet has entered sympathetically into
the subject.

The following stanzas are typical:

    But _we_ who are dark, we are dark Ah God, we have no stars!

About our souls in care and cark Our blackness shuts like
   prison-bars; The poor souls crouch so far behind That never a
comfort can they find By reaching through the prison-bars

.
  

* * * * *

Why, in that single glance I had Of my child's face, ...
    I tell you all, I saw a
   look that made me
  mad The _master's_
   look, that used to fall On my soul like his lash ... or worse And
so, to save it from my curse, I twisted it round in my shawl

.
    
   * * * * *

From the
white man's
house, and the black man's hut, I carried the little body on; The
forest's arm did round us shut, And silence through the trees did
run:
They asked no question as I went, They stood too high for astonishment,
They could see God sit on his throne

.
    
   * * * * *
  (Man, drop that stone you dared to lift!--)
   I wish you who stand there five abreast, Each, for his own wife's joy
       and gift,
    A little corpse as safely at rest As mine in the mangoes: Yes, but
_she_ My keep live babies on her knee, And sing the song she likes
the best.

In such a review as this of the connections between
    Mrs. Browning and the Negro one can not help
   coming face to face with the question
  whether her famous husband was not himself connected by blood with
the Negro race.

The strain is hardly so pronounced as in men like Alexandre Dumas or
    Leigh Hunt, and as in the
   case of Alexander Hamilton, the point still
  seems to be waiting for final proof. The
   assertion is persistent, however, and there can be little doubt
that such is the case.

The standard life of Browning,[15] after wrestling
    in vain with the problem, dismisses it as
   follows:

    Dr. Furnivall has originated a theory,
   and maintains it as a conviction, that Mr.

Browning's grandmother was more than a Creole in the strict sense
    of the term, that of a person born of
   white parents in the West Indies, and that an
  unmistakable dash of dark blood passed
    from her to her son and grandson.

Such an occurrence was, on the face of it, not impossible, and would be
    absolutely unimportant to my mind, and, I
   think I may add, to that of Mr. Browning's
  sister and son. The poet and his father were
   what we know them, and if Negro blood had any part in their
composition, it was no worse for them, and so much the better for
the Negro.

Aside from this last point, from the evidence that has
    been given, while this of
   course has its limitations, we may safely assert
  that with her large humanity and her enthusiasm
   for liberty, Elizabeth Barrett Browning was one
    of the sturdiest defenders in England
   of the cause of the American Negro at the time of the
  beginning of the Civil War.

It is to be regretted that she did not live to read the
    Emancipation Proclamation and to see
   the Negro started on an
  era of self-reliance and progress.

  PALMARES: THE NEGRO NUMANTIA
  
  
 One of the most glorious
 achievements in the history of the Iberian Peninsula was
 the long and desperate defence
 of Numantia against the Roman legionaries
 sent to effect the destruction
 of the city. When the beleaguered
 inhabitants could no longer maintain themselves, owing to the shortage
 of food supplies, they burned
 the city, and those who were not killed
 in battle with the Romans committed
 suicide. Scipio Æmilianus, the
 Roman leader, entered Numantia
 to find nothing but burning
 embers and piles of
 corpses.
 
 This incident has an almost
 exact parallel in the history of Brazil--only this time the
 heroes were
 Negroes, defending the capital of one of
 the earliest and one of the strangest Negro republics in the
 history of the world. The
 Portuguese, who were the
 first to introduce Negro
 slavery into Europe,
 did not long delay in carrying the
 institution to their colony of
 Brazil. It was in 1574 that the first slave
 ship reached there. Thereafter, great numbers
 of Negroes were brought, especially to
 northern Brazil, in the
 equatorial belt, to work in the profitable sugar fields. No region
 of the Americas was so accessible
 to the slave trade, for the
 Brazilian coast juts out into the Atlantic Ocean
 directly opposite the Gulf of
 Guinea in Africa, whence most of the
 slaves were procured. It is
 profitless here to go into
 the question of the treatment of the slaves
 by their Portuguese masters. Some were badly treated,
 and took the chance of flight to the
 interior forest
 lands, rather than submit any longer.
 Various causes prompted yet others to
 escape from the colonial plantations. Thus many a
 _quilombo_, or Negro village of the forest, was
 formed. By far the most famous
 of these was the _quilombo_ of Palmares,
 whose history is the subject
 of this article.
 
 In 1650, forty determined Negroes of the
 province of Pernambuco, all
 of them natives of Guinea, rose against their
 masters, taking as much as they could in the way of
 arms and provisions, and fled
 to the neighboring forest. There they
 founded a _quilombo_
 on the site of a well-known
 Negro village of earlier days, which
 the Dutch had destroyed. The tale of their escape was told
 throughout the province, with the
 result that it was not long before
 the population of the new _quilombo_ was
 greatly increased. Slaves and freemen were eager to join
 their brethren in the forest. It
 seemed prudent, however, to go farther
 away from the white settlements,
 lest the very strength
 of the Negro town should invite
 annihilation or re-enslavement
 by the planters. Thus it was that
 the inland site of Palmares, not
 far from present-day Anadia,
 was chosen. A town was founded, and
 all seemed well except for
 one thing--an essential to
 permanence was lacking, for there were no women.
 A detachment of Negroes was sent
 on the romantic mission
 of procuring wives for the colony.
 This party marched to the nearest
 plantations, and, without stopping to
 discriminate, took all the
 women it could find, black, mulatto,
 and white. Palmares was now on a secure footing
 indeed.
 
 At first, the inhabitants
lived by a species of
banditry, robbing the whites whenever
they could. Gradually, a more
settled type of
life developed. The Negroes began to
engage in agriculture, and at length entered into
something approximating peaceful relations with the Portuguese
settlements. Trade took the place of warfare, although
fear of the overgrown _quilombo_ was perhaps as much
the motive on the part of the whites
as the desire for profits. A rustic
republic of an admirable type was
formed for the maintenance of internal order and external safety.
Combining republican and monarchical features,
they elected a chief, or king,
called the _Zombe_, who ruled
with absolute authority during the
term of his life. The right of
candidacy was restricted to a
group recognized as composing the bravest
men of the community. Any man
in the state might aspire to this
dignity, provided he had
Negro blood in his veins. There
were other officials, both
of a military and of a civil
character. In the interests of good order,
the _Zombes_ made laws imposing the death penalty for murder, adultery,
and robbery. Slavery existed, and in this
respect there was a curious custom. Every
Negro who had won
his freedom from the white man,
by whatever method, as for
example by a successful flight to Palmares, remained a free
man. Those who were captured while in
a state of slavery, however, became
slaves in Palmares. Thus the
reward of freedom was offered to those who
should escape from the planters, and
a punishment was held out to those
who would not, or could not, do so. In
course of time, the Negro
republic expanded until it included a
number of towns. Palmares alone
is said to have had a
population of 20,000, and
the number of
fighting men in the whole
republic was some
10,000. The capital city,
Palmares, was surrounded
by wooden walls, made of
the trunks of large trees. The city was entered by means of three huge
     gates, on the tops of
which were great platforms, always well guarded.

For nearly half a century the
little republic prospered.
It was perhaps only natural that
the Portuguese settlers
should wish to destroy
it, for it represented an
alien force and an ever
present danger, certainly so far
as their profits from the use of slave
labor went. At any rate,
in the year 1696, Governor
Caetano de Mello of Pernambuco decided
upon an expedition against
Palmares. A strong force was
sent, but it was met by the Negroes
and totally defeated. A veritable army of
some 7,000 men was now
gathered, and placed under
the command of a competent soldier named
Bernardo Vieira. This time, the
Portuguese troops were well provided
with artillery, with which the
Negro republic could not be expected to cope. Palmares was reached,
but it was in no
mood for surrender, and it was necessary
to begin a regular siege of the
city. The defence was desperate. After the Portuguese artillery had
breached the walls in three
places, their infantry
attacked in force. They entered the city,
but had to take it, foot by foot. At last,
the defenders came to the center of Palmares, where a high cliff impeded
further retreat. Death or surrender were now
the only alternatives. Seeing that his
cause was lost beyond repair,
the _Zombe_ hurled himself over
the cliff, and his action was followed
by the most distinguished of his fighting men. Some
prisoners were indeed taken, but
it is perhaps a tribute to Palmares, though a gruesome one, that
they were all put to death; it was not safe to enslave
these men, despite the value of their labor. Thus passed Palmares, the
     Negro
Numantia, most famous and greatest of the Brazilian
_qui-lombos_.

SLAVERY IN CALIFORNIA

Slavery in California prior to the Mexican War
was slavery in the Spanish possessions. The
Spaniards began with the enslavement of Indians and
later at the advice of De las Casas
changed to that of Negroes.[16]
This system was first used in the West Indies and later extended to
     other
colonies. It is said that about the year 1537,
Cortes fitted out at the port of Tehuantepec,
several small vessels, provided with
everything required for planting a
colony and sailed north to the
head of the Gulf of California,
transporting four hundred Spaniards and
three hundred Negro slaves, that
he had assembled for that purpose.[17] This is the first mention
of Negro slavery in California. After the founding of the Mission
of San Carlos by the president, Father Junipero Serra, with a
community of twenty-three friars, we read that the first interment
in the cemetery was that of Ignacio Ramirez, a former mulatto slave
from San Antonio, who had money to purchase his freedom.[18] There
were too a number of Negro slaves brought to California between
these periods. They came on trading ships and with various expeditions,
which they usually deserted after reaching the State. Hittell is
wrong, therefore, in saying that the first slave in California was
brought there in 1825 when the wife of Antonio José de Cot, a
Spaniard, brought with her a slave girl named Juana, fourteen years
of age, from Lima to San Francisco. He doubted even that this was
the first slave in California for the lady expressed her intention
to avail herself of the first opportunity to leave.[19]
Spain did not especially bother about Negro slavery in her Pacific
coast territory for nearly two hundred years before the coming of
the Americans.A CITY WATER-SUPPLY, ABOUT 1830

THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION


INTRODUCTION

THE SOURCES OF OUR CIVILIZATION


The Civilization which we of to-day enjoy is a very complex thing, made up
of many different contributions, some large and some small, from people in
many different lands and different ages. To trace all these contributions
back to their sources would be a task impossible of accomplishment, and,
while specific parts would be interesting, for our purposes they would not
be important. Especially would it not be profitable for us to attempt to
trace the development of minor features, or to go back to the rudimentary
civilizations of primitive peoples. The early development of civilization
among the Chinese, the Hindoos, the Persians, the Egyptians, or the
American Indians all alike present features which to some form a very
interesting study, but our western civilization does not go back to these
as sources, and consequently they need not concern us in the study we are
about to begin. While we have obtained the alphabet from the Phoenicians
and some of our mathematical and scientific developments through the
medium of the Mohammedans, the real sources of our present-day
civilization lie elsewhere, and these minor sources will be referred to
but briefly and only as they influenced the course of western progress.

The civilization which we now know and enjoy has come down to us from four
main sources. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Christians laid the
foundations, and in the order named, and the study of the early history of
our western civilization is a study of the work and the blending of these
three main forces. It is upon these three foundation stones, superimposed
upon one another, that our modern European and American civilization has
been developed. The Germanic tribes, overrunning the boundaries of the
Roman Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries, added another new force of
largest future significance, and one which profoundly modified all
subsequent progress and development. To these four main sources we have
made many additions in modern times, building an entirely new
superstructure on the old foundations, but the groundwork of our
civilization is composed of these four foundation elements. For these
reasons a history of even modern education almost of necessity goes back,
briefly at least, to the work and contributions of these ancient peoples.

Starting, then, with the work of the Greeks, we shall state briefly the
contributions to the stream of civilization which have come down to us
from each of the important historic peoples or groups or forces, and shall
trace the blending and assimilating processes of the centuries. While
describing briefly the educational institutions and ideas of the different
peoples, we shall be far less concerned, as we progress down the
centuries, with the educational and philosophical theories advanced by
thinkers among them than with what was actually done, and with the lasting
contributions which they made to our educational practices and to our
present-day civilization.

The work of Greece lies at the bottom and, in a sense, was the most
important of all the earlier contributions to our education and
civilization. These people, known as Hellenes, were the pioneers of
western civilization. Their position in the ancient world is well shown on
the map reproduced opposite. To the East lay the older political
despotisms, with their caste-type and intellectually stagnant organization
of society, and to the North and West a little-known region inhabited by
barbarian tribes. It was in such a world that our western civilization had
its birth. These Greeks, and especially the Athenian Greeks, represented
an entirely new spirit in the world. In place of the repression of all
individuality, and the stagnant conditions of society that had
characterized the civilizations before them, they developed a civilization
characterized by individual freedom and opportunity, and for the first
time in world history a premium was placed on personal and political
initiative. In time this new western spirit was challenged by the older
eastern type of civilization. Long foreseeing the danger, and in fear of
what might happen, the little Greek States had developed educational
systems in part designed to prepare their citizens for what might come.
Finally, in a series of memorable battles, the Greeks, led by Athens,
broke the dread power of the Persian name and made the future of this new
type of civilization secure. At Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea the fate of
our western civilization trembled in the balance. Now followed the great
creative period in Greek life, during which the Athenian Greeks matured
and developed a literature, philosophy, and art which were to be enjoyed
not only by themselves, but by all western peoples since their time. In
these lines of culture the world will forever remain debtor to this small
but active and creative people.

[Illustration: FIG. I. THE EARLY GREEK CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD

about 500 B.C.]

The next great source of our western civilization was the work of Rome.
Like the Greeks, the Romans also occupied a peninsula jutting southward
into the Mediterranean, but in most respects they were far different in
type. Unlike the active, imaginative, artistic, and creative Greeks, the
Romans were a practical, concrete, unimaginative, and executive people.
Energy, personality, and executive power were in greatest demand among
them.

The work of Rome was political, governmental, and legal--not artistic or
intellectual. Rome was strong where Greece was weak, and weak where Greece
was strong. As a result the two peoples supplemented one another well in
laying the foundations for our western civilization. The conquests of
Greece were intellectual; those of Rome legal and governmental. Rome
absorbed and amalgamated the whole ancient world into one Empire, to which
she gave a common language, dress, manners, religion, literature, and
political and legal institutions. Adopting Greek learning and educational
practices as her own, she spread them throughout the then-known world. By
her political organization she so fixed Roman ideas as to law and
government throughout the Empire that Christianity built firmly on the
Roman foundations, and the German barbarians, who later swept over the
Empire, could neither destroy nor obliterate them. The Roman conquest of
the world thus decisively influenced the whole course of western history,
spread and perpetuated Greek ideas, and ultimately saved the world from a
great disaster.

To Rome, then, we are indebted most of all for ideas as to government, and
for the introduction of law and order into an unruly world. In all the
intervening centuries between ancient Rome and ourselves, and in spite of
many wars and repeated onslaughts of barbarism, Roman governmental law
still influences and guides our conduct, and this influence is even yet
extending to other lands and other peoples. We are also indebted to Rome
for many practical skills and for important engineering knowledge, which
was saved and passed on to Western Europe through the medium of the monks.
On the other side of the picture, the recent great World War, with all its
awful destruction of life and property, and injury to the orderly progress
of civilization, may be traced directly to the Roman idea of world empire
and the sway of one imperial government, imposing its rule and its culture
on the rest of mankind.

Into this Roman Empire, united and made one by Roman arms and government,
came the first of the modern forces in the ancient world--that of
Christianity--the third great foundation element in our western
civilization. Embracing in its early development many Greek philosophical
ideas, building securely on the Roman governmental organization, and with
its new message for a decaying world, Christianity forms the connecting
link between the ancient and modern civilizations. Taking the conception
of one God which the Jewish tribes of the East had developed, Christianity
changed and expanded this in such a way as to make it a dominant idea in
the world. Exalting the teachings of the fatherhood of God, the
brotherhood of man, the future life, and the need for preparation for a
hereafter, Christianity introduced a new type of religion and offered a
new hope to the poor and oppressed of the ancient world. In so doing a new
ethical force of first importance was added to the effective energies of
mankind, and a basis for the education of all was laid, for the first
time, in the history of the world.

Christianity came at just the right time not only to impart new energy and
hopefulness to a decadent ancient civilization, but also to meet, conquer,
and in time civilize the barbarian hordes from the North which overwhelmed
the Roman Empire. A new and youthful race of German barbarians now
appeared upon the scene, with resulting ravage and destruction, and
anarchy and ignorance, and long centuries ensued during which ancient
civilization fell prey to savage violence and superstition. Progress
ceased in the ancient world. The creative power of antiquity seemed
exhausted. The digestive and assimilative powers of the old world seemed
gone. Greek was forgotten. Latin was corrupted. Knowledge of the arts and
sciences was lost. Schools disappeared. Only the Christian Church remained
to save civilization from the wreck, and it, too, was almost submerged in
the barbaric flood. It took ten centuries partially to civilize, educate,
and mould into homogeneous units this heterogeneous horde of new peoples.
During this long period it required the strongest energies of the few who
understood to preserve the civilization of the past for the enjoyment and
use of a modern world.

Yet these barbarian Germans, great as was the havoc they wrought at first,
in time contributed much to the stream of our modern civilization. They
brought new conceptions of individual worth and freedom into a world
thoroughly impregnated with the ancient idea of the dominance of the State
over the individual. The popular assembly, an elective king, and an
independent and developing system of law were contributions of first
importance which these peoples brought. The individual man and not the
State was, with them, the important unit in society. In the hands of the
Angles and Saxons, particularly, but also among the Celts, Franks,
Helvetii, and Belgae, this idea of individual freedom and of the
subordination of the State to the individual has borne large fruit in
modern times in the self-governing States of France, Switzerland, Belgium,
England and the English self-governing dominions, and in the United States
of America. After much experimenting it now seems certain that the Anglo-
Saxon type of self-government, as developed first in England and further
expanded in the United States, seems destined to be the type of government
in future to rule the world.

It took Europe almost ten centuries to recover from the effects of the
invasion of barbarism which the last two centuries of the Roman Empire
witnessed, to save itself a little later from Mohammedan conquest, and to
pick up the lost threads of the ancient life and begin again the work of
civilization. Finally, however, this was accomplished, largely as a result
of the labor of monks and missionaries. The barbarians were in time
induced to settle down to an agricultural life, to accept Christianity in
name at least, and to yield a more or less grudging obedience to monk and
priest that they might thereby escape the torments of a world to come.
Slowly the monasteries and the churches, aided here and there by far-
sighted kings, worked at the restoration of books and learning, and
finally, first in Italy, and later in the nations evolved from the tribes
that had raided the Empire, there came a period of awakening and
rediscovery which led to the development of the early university
foundations, a wonderful revival of ancient learning, a great expansion of
men's thoughts, a great religious awakening, a wonderful period of world
exploration and discovery, the founding of new nations in new lands, the
reawakening of the spirit of scientific inquiry, the rise of the
democratic spirit, and the evolution of our modern civilization.

By the end of the eleventh century it was clear that the long battle for
the preservation of civilization had been won, but it was not until the
fourteenth century that the Revival of Learning in Italy gave clear
evidence of the rise of the modern spirit. By the year 1500 much had been
accomplished, and the new modern questioning spirit of the Italian Revival
was making progress in many directions. Most of the old learning had been
recovered; the printing-press had been invented, and was at work
multiplying books; the study of Greek and Hebrew had been revived in the
western world; trade and commerce had begun; the cities and the
universities which had arisen had become centers of a new life; a new sea
route to India had been found and was in use; Columbus had discovered a
new world; the Church was more tolerant of new ideas than it had been for
centuries; and thought was being awakened in the western world to a degree
that had not taken place since the days of ancient Rome. The world seemed
about ready for rapid advances in many directions, and great progress in
learning, education, government, art, commerce, and invention seemed
almost within its grasp. Instead, there soon opened the most bitter and
vindictive religious conflict the world has ever known; western Christian
civilization was torn asunder; a century of religious warfare ensued; and
this was followed by other centuries of hatred and intolerance and
suspicion awakened by the great conflict.

Still, out of this conflict, though it for a time checked the orderly
development of civilization, much important educational progress was
ultimately to come. In promulgating the doctrine that the authority of the
Bible in religious matters is superior to the authority of the Church, the
basis for the elementary school for the masses of the people, and in
consequence the education of all, was laid. This meant the creation of an
entirely new type of school--the elementary, for the masses, and taught in
the native tongue--to supplement the Latin secondary schools which had
been an outgrowth of the revival of ancient learning, and the still
earlier cathedral and monastery schools of the Church.

The modern elementary vernacular school may then be said to be essentially
a product of the Protestant Reformation. This is true in a special sense
among those peoples which embraced some form of the Lutheran or
Calvinistic faiths. These were the Germans, Moravians, Swedes, Norwegians,
Finns, Danes, Dutch, Walloons, Swiss, Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French
Huguenots, and the English Puritans. As the Renaissance gave a new
emphasis to the development of secondary schools by supplying them with a
large amount of new subject-matter and a new motive, so the Reformation
movement gave a new motive for the education of children not intended for
the service of the State or the Church, and the development of elementary
vernacular schools was the result. Only in England, of all the revolting
countries, did this Protestant conception as to the necessity of education
for salvation fail to take deep root, with the result that elementary
education in England awaited the new political and social and industrial
impulses of the latter half of the nineteenth century for its real
development.

The rise of the questioning and inferring spirit in the Italian
Renaissance marked the beginnings of the transition from mediaeval to
modern attitudes, and one of the most important outgrowths of this was the
rise of scientific inquiry which in time followed. This meant the
application of human reason to the investigation of the phenomena of
nature, with all that this eventually implied. This, slowly to be sure,
turned the energies of mankind in a new direction, led to the substitution
of inquiry and patient experimentation for assumption and disputation, and
in time produced a scientific and industrial revolution which has changed
the whole nature of the older problems. The scientific spirit has to-day
come to dominate all lines of human thinking, and the applications of
scientific principles have, in the past century, completely changed almost
all the conditions surrounding human life. Applied to education, this new
spirit has transformed the instruction and the methods of the schools, led
to the creation of entirely new types of educational institutions, and
introduced entirely new aims and methods and purposes into the educational
process.

From inquiry into religious matters and inquiry into the phenomena of
nature, it was but a short and a natural step to inquiry into the nature
and functions of government. This led to a critical questioning of the old
established order, the rise of new types of intellectual inquiry, the
growth of a consciousness of national problems, and the bringing to the
front of questions of political interest to a degree unknown since the
days of ancient Rome. The eighteenth century marks, in these directions, a
sharp turning-point in human thinking, and the end of mediaevalism and the
ushering in of modern forms of intellectual liberty. The eighteenth
century, too, witnessed a culmination of a long series of progressive
changes which had been under way for centuries, and the flood time of a
slowly but steadily rising tide of protest against the enslavement of the
intellect and the limitation of natural human liberties by either Church
or State. The flood of individualism which characterized the second half
of the eighteenth century demanded outlet, and, denied, it rose and swept
away ancient privileges, abuses, and barriers--religious, intellectual,
social, and political--and opened the way for the marked progress in all
lines which characterized the nineteenth century. Out of this new spirit
was to come the American and the French Revolutions, the establishment of
constitutional liberty and religious freedom, the beginnings of the
abolition of privilege, the rise of democracy, a great extension of
educational advantages, and the transfer of the control of the school from
the Church to the State that the national welfare might be better promoted
thereby.

Now arose the modern conception of the school as the great constructive
instrument of the State, and a new individual and national theory as to
both the nature and the purpose of education was advanced. Schools were
declared to be essentially civil affairs; their purpose was asserted to be
to promote the common welfare and advance the interests of the political
State; ministers of education began to be appointed by the State to take
over and exercise control; the citizen supplanted the ecclesiastic in the
organization of education and the supervision of classroom teaching; the
instruction in the school was changed in direction, and in time vastly
broadened in scope; and the education of all now came to be conceived of
as a birthright of the child of every citizen.

Since the middle of the nineteenth century a great world movement for the
realization of these new aims, through the taking-over of education from
religious bodies and the establishment of state-controlled school systems,
has taken place. This movement is still going on. Beginning in the nations
which were earliest in the front of the struggle to preserve and extend
what was so well begun by little Greece and Imperial Rome, the state-
control conception of education has, in the past three quarters of a
century, spread to every continent on the globe. For ages a Church and
private affair, of no particular concern to government and of importance
to but a relatively small number of the people, education has to-day
become, with the rise and spread of modern ideas as to human freedom,
political equality, and industrial progress, a prime essential to the
maintenance of good government and the promotion of national welfare, and
it is now so recognized by progressive nations everywhere. With the spread
of the state-control idea as to education have also gone western ideas as
to government, human rights, social obligations, political equality, pure
and applied science, trade, industry, transportation, intellectual and
moral improvement, and humanitarian influences which are rapidly
transforming and modernizing not only less progressive western nations,
but ancient civilizations as well, and along the lines so slowly and so
painfully worked out by the inheritors of the conceptions of human freedom
first thought out in little Greece, and those of political equality and
government under law so well worked out by ancient Rome, Western
civilization thus promises to become the dominant force in world
civilization and human progress, with general education as its agent and
greatest constructive force.

Such is a brief outline sketch of the history of the rise and spread and
progress of our western civilization, as expressed in the history of the
progress of education, and as we shall trace it in much more detail in the
chapters which are to follow. The road that man has traveled from the days
when might made right, and when children had no claims which the State or
parents were bound to respect, to a time when the child is regarded as of
first importance, and adults represented in the State declare by law that
the child shall be protected and shall have abundant educational
advantages, is a long road and at times a very crooked one. Its ups and
downs and forward movements have been those of the progress of the race,
and in consequence a history of educational progress must be in part a
history of the progress of civilization itself. Human civilization,
though, represents a more or less orderly evolution, and the education of
man stands as one of the highest expressions of a belief in the
improvability of the race of which mankind is capable.

It is such a development that we propose to trace, and, having now
sketched the broader outlines of the treatment, we next turn to a filling-
in of the details, and begin with the Ancient World and the first
foundation element as found in the little City-States of ancient Greece.

CHAPTER I

THE OLD GREEK EDUCATION


I. GREECE AND ITS PEOPLE

THE LAND. Ancient Greece, or Hellas as the Greeks called their homeland,
was but a small country. The map given below shows the Aegean world
superimposed on the States of the old Northwest Territory, from which it
may be seen that the Greek mainland was a little less than half as large
as the State of Illinois. Greece proper was about the size of the State of
West Virginia, but it was a much more mountainous land. No spot in Greece
was over forty miles from the sea. Attica, where a most wonderful
intellectual life arose and flourished for centuries, and whose
contributions to civilization were the chief glory of Greece, was smaller
than two average-size Illinois counties, and about two thirds the size of
the little State of Rhode Island. [1] The country was sparsely populated,
except in a few of the City-States, and probably did not, at its most
prosperous period, contain much more than a million and a half of people--
citizens, foreigners, and slaves included.

[Illustration: FIG. 2. ANCIENT GREECE AND THE AEGEAN WORLD
Superimposed on the East-North-Central Group of American States, to show
relative size. Dotted lines indicate the boundaries of the American
States--Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, etc. All of Greece will be seen to be
a little less than half the size of the State of Illinois, the Aegean Sea
about the size of the State of Indiana, and Attica not quite so large as
two average-size Illinois counties.]

The land was rough and mountainous, and deeply indented by the sea. The
climate and vegetation were not greatly unlike the climate and vegetation
of Southern California. Pine and fir on the mountain-slopes, and figs,
olives, oranges, lemons, and grapes on the hillsides and plains below,
were characteristic of the land. Fishing, agriculture, and the raising of
cattle and sheep were the important industries. A temperate, bracing
climate, short, mild winters, and a long, dry summer gave an opportunity
for the development of this wonderful civilization. Like Southern
California or Florida in winter, it was essentially an out-of-doors
country. The high mountains to the rear, the sun-steeped skies, and the
brilliant sea in front were alike the beauty of the land and the
inspiration of the people. Especially was this true of Attica, which had
the seashore, the plain, the high mountains, and everywhere magnificent
views through an atmosphere of remarkable clearness. A land of
incomparable beauty and charm, it is little wonder that the Greek citizen,
and the Athenian in particular, took pride in and loved his country, and
was willing to spend much time in preparing himself to govern and defend
it.

THE GOVERNMENT. Politically, Greece was composed of a number of
independent City-States of small size. They had been settled by early
tribes, which originally held the land in common. Attica, with its
approximately seven hundred square miles of territory, was an average-size
City-State. The central city, the surrounding farming and grazing lands,
and the coastal regions all taken together, formed the State, the citizens
of which--city-residents, farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen--controlled the
government. There were in all some twenty of these City-States in mainland
Greece, the most important of which were Attica, of which Athens was the
central city; Laconia, of which Sparta was the central city; and Boeotia,
of which Thebes was the central city. Some of the States developed
democracies, of which class Athens became the most notable example, while
some were governed as oligarchies. Of all the different States but few
played any conspicuous part in the history of Greece. Of these few Attica
stands clearly above them all as the leader in thought and art and the
most progressive in government. Here, truly, was a most wonderful people,
and it is with Attica that the student of the history of education is most
concerned. The best of all Greece was there.

[Illustration: FIG. 3. THE CITY-STATE OF ATTICA]

The little City-States of Greece, as has just been said, were independent
States, just like modern nations. While all the Greeks regarded themselves
as tribes of a single family, descended from a common ancestor, Hellen,
and the bonds of a common race, language, and religion tended to unite
them into a sort of brotherhood, the different City-States were held apart
by their tribal origins, by narrow political sympathies, and by petty
laws. A citizen of one city, for example, was an alien in another, and
could not hold property or marry in a city not his own. Such attitudes and
laws were but natural, the time and age considered.

Sometimes, in case of great danger, as at the time of the Persian
invasions (492-479 B.C.), a number of the States would combine to form a
defensive league; at other times they made war on one another. The federal
principle, such as we know it in the United States in our state and
national governments, never came into play. At different times Athens,
Sparta, and Thebes aspired to the leadership of Greece and tried to unite
the little States into a Hellenic Nation, but the mutual jealousies and
the extreme individualism of the people, coupled with the isolation of the
States and the difficulties of intercommunication through the mountain
passes, stood in the way of any permanent union. [2] What Rome later
accomplished with relative ease and on a large scale, Greece was unable to
do on even a small scale. A lack of capacity to unite for coöperative
undertakings seemed to be a fatal weakness of the Greek character.

THE PEOPLE. The Greeks were among the first of the European peoples to
attain to any high degree of civilization. Their story runs back almost to
the dawn of recorded history. As early as 3500 B.C. they were in an
advanced stone age, and by 2500 B.C. had reached the age of bronze. The
destruction of Homer's Troy dates back to 1200 B.C., and the Homeric poems
to 1100 B.C., while an earlier Troy (Schliemann's second city) goes back
to 2400 B.C. This history concerns the mainland of Asia Minor. By 1000
B.C. the southern peninsula of Greece had been colonized, between 900 and
800 B.C. Attica and other portions of upper Greece had been settled, and
by 650 B.C. Greek colonization had extended to many parts of the
Mediterranean. [3]

The lower part of the Greek peninsula, known as Laconia, was settled by
the Dorian branch of the Greek family, a practical, forceful, but a wholly
unimaginative people. Sparta was their most important city. To the north
were the Ionic Greeks, a many-sided and a highly imaginative people.
Athens was their chief city. In the settlement of Laconia the Spartans
imposed themselves as an army of occupation on the original inhabitants,
whom they compelled to pay tribute to them, and established a military
monarchy in southern Greece. The people of Attica, on the other hand,
absorbed into their own body the few earlier settlers of the Attic plain.
They also established a monarchy, but, being a people more capable of
progress, this later evolved into a democracy. The people of Attica were
in consequence a somewhat mixed race, which possibly in part accounts for
their greater intellectual ability and versatility. [4]

It accounts, though, only in part. Climate, beautiful surroundings, and
contact with the outside world probably also contributed something, but
the real basis underneath was the very superior quality of the people of
Attica. In some way, just how we do not know, these people came to be
endowed with a superior genius and the rather unusual ability to make
those progressive changes in living and government which enabled them to
make the most of their surroundings and opportunities, and to advance
while others stood still. Far more than other Greeks, the people of Attica
were imaginative, original, versatile, adaptable, progressive, endowed
with rare mental ability, keenly sensitive to beauty in nature and art,
and possessed of a wonderful sense of proportion and a capacity for
moderation in all things. Only on such an assumption can we account for
their marvelous achievements in art, philosophy, literature, and science
at this very early period in the development of the civilization of the
world.

CLASSES IN THE POPULATION. Greece, as was the ancient world in general,
was built politically on the dominant power of a ruling class. In
consequence, all of course could not become citizens of the State, even
after a democracy had been evolved. Citizenship came with birth and proper
education, and, before 509 B.C., foreigners were seldom admitted to
privileges in the State. Only a male citizen might hold office, protect
himself in the courts, own land, or attend the public assemblies. Only a
citizen, too, could participate in the religious festivals and rites, for
religion was an affair of the ruling families of the State. In
consequence, family, religion, and citizenship were all bound up together,
and education and training were chiefly for citizenship and religious
(moral) ends.

Even more, citizenship everywhere in the earlier period was a degree to be
attained to only after proper education and preliminary military and
political training. This not only made some form of education necessary,
but confined educational advantages to male youths of proper birth. There
was of course no purpose in educating any others. [5] From Figure 4 it
will be seen what a small percentage of the total population this
included. Education in Greece was essentially the education of the
children of the ruling class to perpetuate the rule of that class.

Attica almost alone among the Greek States adopted anything approaching a
liberal attitude toward the foreign-born; in Sparta, and generally
elsewhere in Greece, they were looked upon with deep suspicion. As a
result most of the foreign residents of Greece were to be found in Athens,
or its neighboring port city (the Piraeus), attracted there by the
hospitality of the people and the intellectual or commercial advantages of
these cities. After Athens had become the center of world thought, many
foreigners took up their residence in the city because of the importance
of its intellectual life. Foreigners, though, they remained up to 509 B.C.
(See page 40.) Only rarely before this date, and then only for some
conspicuous act of patriotism, and by special vote of the citizens, was a
foreigner admitted to citizenship. Unlike Rome, which received those of
alien birth freely into its citizenship, and opened up to them large
opportunities of every kind, the Greeks persistently refused to assimilate
the foreign-born. Regarding themselves as a superior people, descended
from the gods, they held themselves apart rather exclusively as above
other peoples. This kept the blood pure, but, from the standpoint of world
usefulness, it was a serious defect in Greek life. [6]

Beneath both citizens and foreign residents was a great foundation mass of
working slaves, who rendered all types of menial and intellectual
services. Sailors, household servants, field workers, clerks in shops and
offices, accountants, and pedagogues were among the more common
occupations of slaves in Greece. Many of these had been citizens and
learned men of other City-States or countries, but had been carried off as
captives in some war. This was a common practice in the ancient world,
slavery being the lot of alien conquered people almost without exception.
The composition of Attica, just before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian
War (431 B.C.) is shown in Figure 4. The great number of slaves and
foreigners is clearly seen, even though the citizenship had by this time
been greatly extended. In Sparta and in other City-States somewhat similar
conditions prevailed as to numbers [7] but there the slaves (Helots)
occupied a lower status than in Athens, being in reality serfs, tied to
and being sold with the land, and having no rights which a citizen was
bound to respect.

[Illustration: FIG. 4. DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION OF ATHENS AND
ATTICA, ABOUT 430 B.C. (After Gulick)]

Education, then, being only for the male children of citizens, and
citizenship a degree to be attained to on the basis of education and
training, let us next see in what that education consisted, and what were
its most prominent characteristics and results.


II. EARLY EDUCATION IN GREECE

Some form of education that would train the son of the citizen for
participation in the religious observances and duties of a citizen of the
State, and would prepare the State for defense against outward enemies,
was everywhere in Greece recognized as a public necessity, though its
provision, nature, and extent varied in the different City-States. We have
clear information only as to Sparta and Athens, and will consider only
these two as types. Sparta is interesting as representing the old Greek
tribal training, from which Sparta never progressed. Many of the other
Greek City-States probably maintained a system of training much like that
of Sparta. Such educational systems stand as undesirable examples of
extreme state socialism, contributed little to our western civilization,
and need not detain us long. It was Athens, and a few other City-States
which followed her example, which presented the best of Greece and passed
on to the modern world what was most valuable for civilization.

1. _Education in Sparta_

THE PEOPLE. The system of training which was maintained in Sparta was in
part a reflection of the character of the people, and in part a result of
its geographical location. A warlike people by nature, the Spartans were
for long regarded as the ablest fighters in Greece. Laconia, their home,
was a plain surrounded by mountains. They represented but a small
percentage of the total population, which they held in subjection to them
by their military power. [8] The slaves (Helots) were often troublesome,
and were held in check by many kinds of questionable practices. Education
for citizenship with the Spartans meant education for usefulness in an
intensely military State, where preparedness was a prerequisite to safety.
Strength, courage, endurance, cunning, patriotism, and obedience were the
virtues most highly prized, while the humane, literary, and artistic
sentiments were neglected (R. I). Aristotle well expressed it when he said
that "Sparta prepared and trained for war, and in peace rusted like a
sword in its scabbard."

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. At birth the child was examined by a council of
elders (R. I), and if it did not appear to be a promising child it was
exposed to die in the mountains. If kept, the mother had charge of the
child until seven if a boy, and still longer if a girl. At the beginning
of the eighth year, and until the boy reached the age of eighteen, he
lived in a public barrack, where he was given little except physical drill
and instruction in the Spartan virtues. His food and clothing were scant
and his bed hard. Each older man was a teacher. Running, leaping, boxing,
wrestling, military music, military drill, ball-playing, the use of the
spear, fighting, stealing, and laconic speech and demeanor constituted the
course of study. From eighteen to twenty was spent in professional
training for war, and frequently the youth was publicly whipped to develop
his courage and endurance. For the next ten years--that is, until he was
thirty years old--he was in the army at some frontier post. At thirty the
young man was admitted to full citizenship and compelled to marry, though
continuing to live at the public barrack and spending his energies in
training boys (R. 1). Women and girls were given gymnastic training to
make them strong and capable of bearing strong children. The family was
virtually suppressed in the interests of defense and war. [9] The
intellectual training consisted chiefly in committing to memory the Laws
of Lycurgus, learning a few selections from Homer, and listening to the
conversation of the older men.

As might naturally be supposed, Sparta contributed little of anything to
art, literature, science, philosophy, or government. She left to the world
some splendid examples of heroism, as for example the sacrifice of
Leonidas and his Spartans to hold the pass at Thermopylae, and a warning
example of the brutalizing effect on a people of excessive devotion to
military training. It is a pleasure to turn from this dark picture to the
wonderful (for the time) educational system that was gradually developed
at Athens.

2. _The old Athenian education_

SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. Athenian education divides itself naturally into two
divisions--the old Athenian training which prevailed up to about the time
of the close of the Persian Wars (479 B.C.) and was an outgrowth of
earlier tribal observances and practices, and later Athenian education,
which characterized the period of maximum greatness of Athens and
afterward. We shall describe these briefly, in order.

The state military socialism of Sparta made no headway in more democratic
Attica. The citizens were too individualistic, and did their own thinking
too well to permit the establishment of any such plan. While education was
a necessity for citizenship, and the degree could not be obtained without
it, the State nevertheless left every citizen free to make his own
arrangements for the education of his sons, or to omit such education if
he saw fit. Only instruction in reading, writing, music, and gymnastics
were required. If family pride, and the sense of obligation of a parent
and a citizen were not sufficient to force the father to educate his son,
the son was then by law freed from the necessity of supporting his father
in his old age. The State supervised education, but did not establish it.

The teachers were private teachers, and derived their livelihood from
fees. These naturally varied much with the kind of teacher and the wealth
of the parent, much as private lessons in music or dancing do to-day. As
was common in antiquity, the teachers occupied but a low social position
(R. 5), and only in the higher schools of Athens was their standing of any
importance. Greek literature contains many passages which show the low
social status of the schoolmaster. [10] Schools were open from dawn to
dark. The school discipline was severe, the rod being freely used both in
the school and in the home. There were no Saturday and Sunday holidays or
long vacations, such as we know, but about ninety festival and other state
holidays served to break the continuity of instruction (R. 3). The
schoolrooms were provided by the teachers, and were wholly lacking in
teaching equipment, in any modern sense of the term. However, but little
was needed. The instruction was largely individual instruction, the boy
coming, usually in charge of an old slave known as a _pedagogue_, to
receive or recite his lessons. The teaching process was essentially a
telling and a learning-by-heart procedure.

For the earlier years there were two schools which boys attended--the
music and literary school, and a school for physical training. Boys
probably spent part of the day at one school and part at the other, though
this is not certain. They may have attended the two schools on alternate
days. From sixteen to eighteen, if his parents were able, the boy attended
a state-supported _gymnasium_, where an advanced type of physical training
was given. As this was preparatory for the next two years of army service,
the _gymnasia_ were supported by the State more as preparedness measures
than as educational institutions, though they partook of the nature of
both.

[Illustration: FIG. 5. A GREEK BOY]

EARLY CHILDHOOD. As at Sparta the infant was examined at birth, but the
father, and not a council of citizens, decided whether or not it was to be
"exposed" or preserved. Three ceremonies, of ancient tribal origin, marked
the recognition and acceptance of the child. The first took place five
days after birth, when the child was carried around the family hearth by
the nurse, followed by the household in procession. This ceremony,
followed by a feast, was designed to place the child forever under the
care of the family gods. On the tenth day the child was named by the
father, who then formally recognized the child as his own and committed
himself to its rearing and education. The third ceremony took place at the
autumn family festival, when all children born during the preceding year
were presented to the father's clansmen, who decided, by vote, whether or
not the boy or girl was the legitimate and lawful child of Athenian
parents. If approved, the child's name was entered on the registry of the
clan, and he might then aspire to citizenship and inherit property from
his parent (R. 4).

Up to the age of seven both boys and girls grew up together in the home,
under the care of the nurse and mother, engaging in much the same games
and sports as do children anywhere. From the first they were carefully
disciplined for good behavior and for the establishment of self-control
(R. 3). After the age of seven the boy and girl parted company in the
matter of their education, the girl remaining closely secluded in the home
(women and children were usually confined to the upper floor of the house)
and being instructed in the household arts by her mother, while the boy
went to different teachers for his education. Probably many girls learned
to read and write from their mothers or nurses, and the daughters of well-
to-do citizens learned to spin, weave, sew, and embroider. Music was also
a common accomplishment of women. [11]

THE SCHOOL OF THE GRAMMATIST. A Greek boy, unlike a modern school child,
did not go to one teacher. Instead he had at least two teachers, and
sometimes three. To the _grammatist_, who was doubtless an evolution from
an earlier tribal scribe, he went to learn to read and write and count.
The grammatist represented the earliest or primary teacher. To the music
teacher, who probably at first taught reading and writing also, he went
for his instruction in music and literature. Finally, to the _palaestra_
he went for instruction in physical training (R. 3).

[Illustration: FIG. 6. AN ATHENIAN INSCRIPTION
A decree of the Council and Assembly, dating from about 450 B.C. Note the
difficulty of trying to read without any punctuation, and with only
capital letters.]

Reading was taught by first learning the letters, then syllables, and
finally words. [12] Plaques of baked earth, on which the alphabet was
written, like the more modern horn-book (see Figure 130), were frequently
used. [13] The ease with which modern children learn to read was unknown
in Greece. Reading was very difficult to learn, as accentuation,
punctuation, spacing between words, and small letters had not as yet been
introduced. As a result the study required much time, [14] and much
personal ingenuity had to be exercised in determining the meaning of a
sentence. The inscription shown in Figure 6 will illustrate the
difficulties quite well. The Athenian accent, too, was hard to acquire.

[Illustration: FIG. 7. GREEK WRITING-MATERIALS]

The pupil learned to write by first tracing, with the stylus, letters cut
in wax tablets, and later by copying exercises set for him by his teacher,
using the wax tablet and writing on his knee. Still later the pupil
learned to write with ink on papyrus or parchment, though, due to the cost
of parchment in ancient times, this was not greatly used. Slates and paper
were of course unknown in Greece.

There was little need for arithmetic, and but little was taught.
Arithmetic such as we teach would have been impossible with their cumbrous
system of notation. [15] Only the elements of counting were taught, the
Greek using his fingers or a counting-board, such as is shown in Figure 8,
to do his simple reckoning.

[Illustration: FIG. 8 A GREEK COUNTING-BOARD
Pebbles of different size or color were used for thousands, hundreds,
tens, and units. Their position on the board gave them their values. The
board now shows the total 15,379.]

GREAT IMPORTANCE OF READING AND LITERATURE. After the pupil had learned to
read, much attention was given to accentuation and articulation, in order
to secure beautiful reading. Still more, in reading or reciting, the parts
were acted out. The Greeks were a nation of actors, and the recitations in
the schools and the acting in the theaters gave plenty of opportunity for
expression. There were no schoolbooks, as we know them. The master
dictated and the pupils wrote down, or, not uncommonly, learned by heart
what the master dictated. Ink and parchment were now used, the boy making
his own schoolbooks. Homer was the first and the great reading book of the
Greeks, the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ being the Bible of the Greek people.
Then followed Hesiod, Theognis, the Greek poets, and the fables of Aesop.
[16] Reading, declamation, and music were closely interrelated. To appeal
to the emotions and to stir the will along moral and civic lines was a
fundamental purpose of the instruction (R. 5). A modern writer well
characterizes the ancient instruction in literature in the following
words:

By making the works of the great poets of the Greek people the material of
their education, the Athenians attained a variety of objects difficult of
attainment by any other one means. The fact is, the ancient poetry of
Greece, with its finished form, its heroic tales and characters, its
accounts of peoples far removed in time and space, its manliness and
pathos, its directness and simplicity, its piety and wisdom, its respect
for law and order, combined with its admiration for personal initiative
and worth, furnished, in the hands of a careful and genial teacher, a
material for a complete education such as could not well be matched even
in our own day. What instruction in ethics, politics, social life, and
manly bearing could not find a fitting vehicle in the Homeric poems, not
to speak of the geography, the grammar, the literary criticism, and the
history which the comprehension of them involved? Into what a wholesome,
unsentimental, free world did these poems introduce the imaginative Greek
boy! What splendid ideals of manhood and womanhood did they hold up for
his admiration and imitation! From Hesiod he would learn all that he
needed to know about his gods and their relation to him and his people.
From the elegiac poets he would derive a fund of political and social
wisdom, and an impetus to patriotism, which would go far to make him a
good man and a good citizen. From the iambic poets he would learn to
express with energy his indignation at meanness, feebleness, wrong, and
tyranny, while from the lyric poets he would learn the language suitable
to every genial feeling and impulse of the human heart. And in reciting or
singing all these, how would his power of terse, idiomatic expression, his
sense of poetic beauty and his ear for rhythm and music be developed! With
what a treasure of examples of every virtue and vice, and with what a fund
of epigrammatic expression would his memory be furnished! How familiar he
would be with the character and ideals of his nation, how deeply in
sympathy with them! And all this was possible even before the introduction
of letters. With this event a new era in education begins. The boy now not
only learns and declaims his Homer, and sings his Simonides or Sappho; he
learns also to write down their verses from dictation, and so at once to
read and to write. This, indeed, was the way in which these two (to us)
fundamental arts were acquired. As soon as the boy could trace with his
finger in sand, or scratch with a stylus on wax, the forms of the letters,
and combine them into syllables and words, he began to write poetry from
his master's dictation. The writing-lesson of to-day was the reading,
recitation, or singing-lesson of to-morrow. Every boy made his own reading
book, and, if he found it illegible, and stumbled in reading, he had only
himself to blame. The Greeks, and especially the Athenians, laid the
greatest stress on reading well, reciting well, and singing well, and the
youth who could not do all three was looked upon as uncultured. Nor could
he hide his want of culture, since young men were continually called upon,
both at home and at more or less public gatherings, to perform their part
in the social entertainment. [17]

music lesson. On the wall are hung a roll of manuscript, a folded writing-
tablet, a lyre, and an unknown cross-shaped object.

legged, the _paidagogos_, who has just brought in his pupil. The boy
stands before the teacher of poetry and recites his lesson. The master, in
a chair, holds in his hand a roll which he is unfolding, upon which we see
Greek letters. Above these three figures we see on the wall a cup, a lyre,
and a leather case of flutes. To the bag is attached the small box
containing mouthpieces of different kinds for the flutes. Farther on a
pupil is receiving a lesson in music. The master and pupil are both seated
on seats without backs. The master, with head erect, looks at the pupil
who, bent over his lyre, seems absorbed in his playing. Above are hanging
a basket, a lyre, and a cup. On the wall is an inscription in Greek.]

THE MUSIC SCHOOL. The teacher in this school gradually separated himself
from the grammatist, and often the two were found in adjoining rooms in
the same school. In his functions he succeeded the wandering poet or
minstrel of earlier times. Music teachers were common in all the City-
States of Greece. To this teacher the boy went at first to recite his
poetry, and after the thirteenth year for a special music course. The
teacher was known as a _citharist_, and the instrument usually used was
the seven-stringed lyre. This resembled somewhat our modern guitar. The
flute was also used somewhat, but never grew into much favor, partly
because it tended to excite rather than soothe, and partly because of the
contortions of the face to which its playing gave rise. Rhythm, melody,
and the feeling for measure and time were important in instruction, whose
office was to soothe, purge, and harmonize man within and make him fit for
moral instruction through the poetry with which their music was ever
associated. Instead of being a distinct art, as with us, and taught by
itself, music with the Greeks was always subsidiary to the expression of
the spirit of their literature, and in aim it was for moral-training ends.
[18] Both Aristotle and Plato advocate state control of school music to
insure sound moral results. Inferior as their music was to present-day
music, it exerted an influence over their lives which it is difficult for
an American teacher to appreciate.

[Illustration: FIG. 10. GREEK SCHOOL LESSONS

THE SINGING LESSON The boy is singing, to the accompaniment of a flute. On
the wall hangs a bag of flutes.

THE LITERATURE LESSON The boy is reciting, while the teacher follows him
on a roll of manuscript.]

The first lessons taught the use of the instrument, and the simple chants
of the religious services were learned. As soon as the pupil knew how to
play, the master taught him to render the works of the great lyric poets
of Greece. Poetry and music together thus formed a single art. At thirteen
a special music course began which lasted until sixteen, but which only
the sons of the more well-to-do citizens attended. Every boy, though,
learned some music, not that he might be a musician, but that he might be
musical and able to perform his part at social gatherings and participate
in the religious services of the State. Professional playing was left to
slaves and foreigners, and was deemed unworthy a free man and a citizen.
Professionalism in either music or athletics was regarded as disgraceful.
The purpose of both activities was harmonious personal development, which
the Greeks believed contributed to moral worth.

THE PALAESTRA; GYMNASTICS. Very unlike our modern education, fully one
half of a boy's school life, from eight to sixteen, was given to sports
and games in another school under different teachers, known as the
palaestra. The work began gradually, but by fifteen had taken precedence
over other studies. As in music, harmonious physical development and moral
ends were held to be of fundamental importance. The standards of success
were far from our modern standards. To win the game was of little
significance; the important thing was to do the part gracefully and, for
the person concerned, well. To attain to a graceful and dignified carriage
of the body, good physical health, perfect control of the temper, and to
develop quickness of perception, self-possession, ease, and skill in the
games were the aims--not mere strength or athletic prowess (R. 2). Only a
few were allowed to train for participation in the Olympian games.

The work began with children's games, contests in running, and ball games
of various kinds. Deportment--how to get up, walk, sit, and how to achieve
easy manners--was taught by the masters. After the pupils came to be a
little older there was a definite course of study, which included, in
succession: (1) leaping and jumping, for general bodily and lung
development; (2) running contests, for agility and endurance; (3) throwing
the discus, [19] for arm exercise; (4) casting the javelin, for bodily
poise and coördination of movement, as well as for future use in hunting;
(5) boxing and wrestling, for quickness, agility, endurance, and the
control of the temper and passions. O triply beatific those Whose
state is classified as married, Untroubled by the green-eyed woes, By
such upheavals never harried.
Ay, three times happy are the wed ones, Who cleave together till they're
dead ones.

IN CHLORIN
Horace: Book III, Ode 15.

"_Uxor pauperis Ibyci_--"

Your conduct, naughty Chloris, is Not just exactly Horace's Ideal of a
lady At the shady Time of life; You mustn't throw your soul away
On foolishness, like Pholoe-- Her days are folly-laden-- She's a maiden,
You're a wife.

Your daughter, with propriety, May look for male society, Do one thing and
another In which mother Shouldn't mix; But revels Bacchanalian Are--or
should be--quite alien To you a married person, Something worse'n
Forty-six!

Yes, Chloris, you cut up too much, You love the dance and cup too
much, Your years are quickly flitting-- To your knitting, Right
about!

Forget the incidental things That keep you from parental things-- The
World,
the Flesh, the Devil, On the level, Cut 'em out!

See my little shack--why, you'd hardly know it.
All the rooms are swept, Sunday-like and shiny; Flowers all around, altar

Neighbours all are coming over to the party, All the busy boys, all
the giggling girlies, Whiffs of certain things wafted from the kitchen--
Simply delicious.

Oh, of course. You ask why the fancy fireworks, Why the awning out, why

Well, I'll tell you why. It's Maecenas' birthday 13th of

CARMEN AMOEBAEUM

I
Horace: Book III, Ode 9.

"Donec gratus eram tibi--"
HORACE
When I was your stiddy, my loveliest Lyddy, And you my embraceable she,
In joys and diversions, the king of the Persians Had nothing on me.

LYDIA
When I was the person you penned all that verse on, Ere Chloe had caused you
to sigh, Not she whose cognomen is Ilia the Roman Was happier
than I.

HORACE
Ah, Chloe the Thracian--whose sweet modulation Of voice as she lilts
to the lyre Is sweeter and fairer?

Would but the Fates spare her I'd love to expire.

LYDIA
Tush! Calais claims me and wholly inflames me, He pesters me never with
rhymes; If they should spare Cally, I'd perish to_tal_ly A couple of
times.

HORACE
Suppose my affection in Lyddy's direction Returned; that I gave the
good-by To Chloe the golden, and back to the olden?

-- I pause for reply.

LYDIA
Cheer up, mine ensnarer! Be Calais fairer Than stars, be you blustery and
base, I'll love you, adore you; in brief, I am for you All over the
place.

II
HORACE
What time I was your one best bet And no one passed the wire before me, Dear
Lyddy, I cannot forget How you would--yes, you would--adore me.
To others you would tie the can; You thought of me with no aversion.

In those days I was happier than A Persian.

LYDIA
Correct.

As long as you were not So nuts about this Chloe person, Your flame for
me burned pretty hot-- Mine was the door you pinned your verse on.

Your favourite name began with L, While I thought you surpassed by no
man-- Gladder than Ilia, the well- Known Roman.

HORACE

On Chloe? Yes, I've got a case; Her voice is such a sweet soprano; Her people
come from Northern Thrace; You ought to hear her play piano.

If she would like my suicide-- If she'd want me a dead and dumb
thing, Me for a glass of cyanide, Or something.

LYDIA
Now Calais, the handsome son Of old Ornitus, has _me_ going; He
says I am his honey bun, He's mine, however winds are blowing; I
think that he is awful nice, And, if the gods the signal gave him,
I'd just as lieve die once or twice To save him.

HORACE
Suppose I'm gone on you again, Suppose I've got ingrown affection
For you; I sort of wonder, then, If you'd have any great objection.

Suppose I pass this Chloe up And say:"Go roll your hoop, I'm rid o' ye!"
Would that drop sweetness in your cup?

Eh, Lydia?

LYDIA
Why, say--though he's fair as a star, And you are like a cork,
erratic And light--and though I know you are As blustery as the
Adriatic, I think I'd rather live with you Or die with you, I swear
to gracious.

So I will be your Mrs. Q.

overly stelliferous-- Come, Lezzy, please add all of these, until
the whole amount of 'em Will sorely vex the rubbernecks attempting
to keep count of 'em.

ODE LXXXV: AD LESBIAM
Hark thou, my Lesbia, there be none existent Can truly say she hath

No faith is more consistent Than that which V. Catullus gives to

How reasonless the state of an emotion!
For wert thou faultless, perfect, and sublime, I could not like
thee; nor would my devotion And love be less wert thou the Queen

The Rich Man

The rich man has his motor-car, His country and his town estate.
He smokes a fifty-cent cigar And jeers at Fate.

He frivols through the livelong day, He knows not Poverty her pinch.
His lot seems light, his heart seems gay, He has a cinch.

Yet though my lamp burns low and dim, Though I must slave for
livelihood-- Think you that I would change with him?

You bet I would!

_ Love me to-night!

Fold your dear arms around me-- Hurt me--I do but glory in your

Tho' your fierce strength absorb, engulf, and drown me, Love me
to-night!

The world's wild stress sounds less than our own heart-beat Its
puny nothingness sinks out of sight.

Just you and I and Love alone are left, sweet-- Love me to-night!

Love me to-night! I care not for to-morrow-- Look in my eyes, aglow
with Love's own light:
Full soon enough will come daylight, and sorrow-- Love me to-night!
_ --BEATRICE M. BARRY, in the _Banquet Table_.

We can't to-night! We're overworked and busy; We've got a lot of
paragraphs to write; Although your invitation drives us dizzy, We
can't to-night!

But, Trixie, we admit we're greatly smit with The heart you picture--incandescent,
white.
We must confess that you have made a hit with Us here to-night.

O Beatrice! O Tempora! O Heaven!
List to our lyre the while the strings we smite; Where shall you be
at--well, say half-past seven To-morrow night?

Those Two Boys

When Bill was a lad he was terribly bad.
He worried his parents a lot; He'd lie and he'd swear and pull little
girls' hair; His boyhood was naught but a blot.

At play and in school he would fracture each rule-- In mischief from autumn
to spring; And the villagers knew when to manhood he grew He would never
amount to a thing.

When Jim was a child he was not very wild; He was known as a good little
boy; He was honest and bright and the teacher's delight-- To his mother
and father a joy.

All the neighbours were sure that his virtue'd endure, That his
life would be free of a spot; They were certain that Jim had a great
head on him And that Jim would amount to a lot.

And Jim grew to manhood and honour and fame And bears a good name;
While Bill is shut up in a dark prison cell-- You never can tell.

The Servants
With genuflexions to Kipling's _"The Ladies"_
We've taken our cooks where we've found 'em; We've answered many
an ad; We've had our pickin' o' servants, And most of the lot was
bad.

Some was Norahs an' Bridgets; Tillie she came last fall; Claras and Fannies
and Lenas and Annies, And now we've got none at all.

Now, we don't know much about servants, For, takin' 'em all along, You never
can tell till you've tried 'em, And then you are like to be wrong.
There's times when you'll think that they're perfect; There's times when
you'll think that they're bum, But the things you'll learn from those
that have gone May help you with those to come.

Norah, she landed from Dublin, Green as acushla machree; Norah was willing
and anxious To learn what a servant should be.
We told Mrs. Kirk all about her-- She offered her seven more per-- Now Norah
she works, as you know, for the Kirks-- And we learned about servants from
her.

Lena we got from an "office"; Lena was saving and Dutch-- Thought
that our bills were enormous, And told us we spent far too much.

Lena decamped with some silver, Jewelry, laces and fur-- She was loving and
kind, with a Socialist mind-- And we learned about servants from her.

Tillie blew in from the Indies, Black as the middle of night-- Cooked like
a regular Savarin-- Kitchen was shiny an' bright.
Everything ran along lovely Until--it was bound to occur-- She ran away with
a porter one day-- But we learned about servants from her.

We've taken our cooks where we've found them, Yellow and black and
white; Some was better than others, But none of the lot was right.
And the end of it's only worry And trouble and bother and fuss-- When you
answer an ad., think of those we have had And learn about servants
from us.

Our Dum'd Animals

    What time I seek my virtuous couch to steal Some surcease from the
       labours of the day, Ere silence like a poultice comes to heal-- In
       short, when I prepare to hit the hay; Ere slumber's chains (I quote
from Moore) have bound me, I hear a lot of noises all around me.

    Time was when falling off the well-known log Were harder far
       than falling off to sleep; But that was ere my neighbour's
       gentle dog Began to think he was defending sheep.
       From twelve to two his barking and his howling Accompanies two
       torn cats' nightly yowling.

    At two-ten sharp the parrot in the flat Across the way his
       monologue essays.

At three, again, as Gilbert says, the cat; At four a milkman's horse,
exulted, neighs.
At six-fifteen, nor does it ever vary, I hear the dulcet tones of a
canary.

Each living thing I love; I love the birds; The beasts in field and
forest, too, I love, But I have writ these poor, if metric words, To query
which, by all the pow'rs above, Of all the animals--pray tell me, some

A Soft Susurrus

A soft susurrus in the night, A song whose singer is unseen-- 'Twere poetry
itself to write "A soft susurrus in the night!" I know, as those
mosquitos bite, That I forgot to fix that screen, "A soft susurrus
in the night!" A song whose singer is unseen.
A Summer Summary
Shall I, lying in a grot, Die because the day is hot?
Or declare I can't endure Such a torrid temperature?
Be it hotter than the flames South Gehenna Junction claims, If it
be not so to me, What care I how hot it be?
Shall I say I love the town Praised by Robinson and Browne?
Shall I say, "In summer heat Old Manhattan can't be beat?" Be it
luring as a bar, Or my neighbour's motor-car, If I think it is
pazziz What care I how fine it is?
Shall I prate of rural joys Far from civic smoke and noise?
Shall I, like the others, drool "But the nights are always cool?"
If I hate to rise at six Shall I praise the suburbs? Nix!
If the country's not for me, What care I how good it be?
Town or country, cool or hot, Differs nothing, matters not; For to
quote that Roman cuss, Why dispute "de gustibus?" If to this or
that one should Take a fancy, it is good.
If these rhymes look good to me, What care I how bad they be?
A Quatrain
A quatrain fills a little space, Although it's pretty small, And
oftentimes, as in this case, It has no point at all.
To a Light Housekeeper
(Who hitches laundering articles to the curtain string and pastes
them on the pane.)
Lady, thou that livest Just across the way, If a hang thou givest
What the people say, If a cuss thou carest What a poet thinks--
Hearken, if thou darest, Most immodest minx!
Though thy gloves thou tiest, To the curtain string, Though the
things thou driest Gird me while I sing, Hankies and inventions Of
the lacy tribe-- Things I may not mention, Let alone describe.
These I mutely stand for Though the sight offend, THIS I reprimand
for; Take it from a friend:
Cease to pin thy tresses To the window sill, Or I'll tell the
presses-- Honestly, I will.

How?
How can I work when you play the piano, Feminine person above?
How can I think, with your ceaseless soprano Singing: "Ah, Love--"?
How can I dream of a subject aesthetic, Far from the purlieus of
prose?
How, with the call of the peripatetic "High! High cash clo'es!"?
How can I write when the children are crying?
How can I poetize--how?
How can I help imper_fect_ versifying?
(There is some now.)
How can I bathe in the thought--waves of beauty?
How, with my nerves on the slant, Can I perform my poetical
duty?
Frankly, I can't.

Ballade of the Breakfast Table
When the Festal Board, as the papers say, Groans 'neath the weight
of a lot to eat, At breakfast, Fruhstuck or dejeuner, (As a bard
tri-lingual I'm rather neat) At breakfast, then, if I may repeat,
This is what gets me into a huff, This is a query I cannot beat:
Why don't they ever have spoons enough?
I've broken my fast with the grave and gay, With hoi polloi and
with the elite; I've been all over the U. S. A.
From Dorchester Crossing to Kearney Street.
But aye when I sit in the morning seat Comes to my notice the
self-same bluff, Plenty of food, but in this they cheat:
Why don't they ever have spoons enough?
Take it at breakfast, only to-day:
This was the layout, fresh and sweet:
Canteloupe, sweet as the new-mown hay;[Footnote: And about as
edible.] Cereal--one of the brands[Footnote: To advertisers: This
space for sale.] of wheat; Soft--boiled eggs (we've cut out the
meat); Coffee (a claro--manila--buff); Napery, china, and glasses
complete-- Why don't they ever have spoons enough?
L'ENVOI
Autocratesses, forgive my heat, But isn't it time to change that
stuff?
Small is the benison I entreat-- Why don't they ever have spoons
enough?

Ornithology
Unlearned I in ornithology-- All I know about the birds Is a bunch
of etymology, Just a lot of high--flown words.
Is the curlew an uxorial Bird? The Latin name for crow?
Is the bulfinch grallatorial?
I dunno.
O'er my head no golden gloriole Ever shall be proudly set For my
knowledge of the oriole, Eagle, ibis, or egrette.
I know less about the tanager And its hopes and fears and aims Than
a busy Broadway manager Does of James.
But, despite my incapacity On the birdies of the air, I am not
without sagacity, Be it ne'er so small a share.
This I know, though ye be scorning at What I know not, though ye
mock, Birdies wake me every morning at Four o'clock.
To Alice--Sit--By--The--Hour
Lady in the blue kimono, you that live across the way, One may see
you gazing, gazing, gazing all the livelong day, Idly looking out
your window from your vantage point above.
Are you convalescent, lady? Are you worse? Are you in love?
Ever gazing, as you hang there on the little window seat, Into flats
across the way or down upon the prosy street.
Can't you rent a pianola? Can't you iron, sew, or cook?
Write a letter, bake a pudding, make a bed or read a book?
Tell me of the fascination you indubitably find In the "High Cash

Are your Spanish castles blue prints? Are you waiting for a knight
To descend upon your fastness and to save you from your plight?
Lady in the blue kimono, idle, mollycoddle dame, Does your doing
nothing never make you feel the blush of shame?
As you sit and stare and ditto, not a single thing to do, Lady in
the blue kimono, lady, how I envy you!
To Alice--Sit--By--The--Hour
(Being the second idyl to an idle idol.)
Lady in the blue kimono, May we write of you again?
Do not hand us out a "No! no!" Do not dam the flowing pen.
Once again a poem at you Crave we leave of you to write-- Lady idle
as a statue, Lady silent as the night!
Lady in the blue kimono, Heavy is our heart and dumb, Though we
weep no tear nor show no Sign of sadness, we are glum; For that
wrapper, silk or cotton, You eternally had on-- It is gone, but not
forgotten.
Still the fact is, it is gone.
Lady in the blue kimono, Although deadly hot the day, Don't you
think--(alas! we know no Way to put what we would say!)
Er--although your smile is pleasant, Wondrous fair, and all that
stuff-- Do you really think, at present, It is--er--ahem--enough?
Notions
Myrtie, my notion of no one to write about Seems to be any one other

anapestic good verses and true.
Eke my conception of no girl to gaze upon, O my Myrtilla, includes
all the rest, Saving the one that I'm spilling this praise upon--
You, as it isn't unlikely you've guessed.
Also my notion of nowhere to be at all-- Pardon, Myrtilla, my lack
of restraint-- Notion of mapless location is----d. it all-- Anywhere
you simultaneous ain't.

To a Lady
Ah, Lady, if these verses glowed Warmer than chill appreciation--
If they should lengthen to an "Ode On Fascination--"
If I should cast this cold restraint, Nor dam this pen's o'ereager

Assuming I should write such dope-- If, haply, you can but conceive

YOU'D not; but, oh, Another would!
For, by and large and altogether, Us potes must be misunderstood.

Craving, as I do, perfection, Loathing anything like flaws, I must
raise a slight objection To your building laws.
You are five one-and-a-quarter, And your girth is thirty-three--
Myrtie, you're a little shorter Than you ought to be.Though dead politically, there now occurred the unusual spectacle of
"captive Greece taking captive her rude conqueror," and spreading Greek
art, literature, philosophy, science, and Greek ideas throughout the
Mediterranean world. It was the Greek higher learning that now became
predominant and exerted such great influence on the future of our world
civilization. It remains now to trace briefly the development and spread
of this higher learning, and to point out how thoroughly it modified the
thinking of the future.

NEW SCHOOLS; SOCRATES. In the beginning each Sophist teacher was a free
lance, and taught what he would and in the manner he thought best. Many of
them made extraordinary efforts to attract students and win popular
approval and fees. Plato represents the Sophist Protagoras as saying, with
reference to a youth ambitious for success in political life, "If he comes
to me he will learn that which he comes to learn." At first the
instruction was largely individual, but later classes were organized.
Isocrates, who lived from 436 to 338 B.C., organized the instruction for
the first time into a well-graded sequence of studies, with definite aims
and work (R. 8). He shifted the emphasis in instruction from training for
success in argumentation, to training to think clearly and to express
ideas properly. His pupils were unusually successful, and his school did
much to add to the fame of Athens as an intellectual center. From his work
sprang a large number of so called Rhetorical Schools, much like our
better private schools and academies, offering to those Ephebes who could
afford to attend a very good preparation for participation in the public
life of the period.

In contrast with the Sophists, a series of schools of philosophy also
arose in Athens. These in a way were the outgrowth of the work of
Socrates. Accepting the Sophists' dictum that "man is the measure of all
things," he tried to turn youths from the baser individualism of the
Sophists of his day to the larger general truths which measure the life of
a true man. In particular he tried to show that the greatest of all arts--
the art of living a good life--called for correct individual thinking and
a knowledge of the right. "Know thyself" was his great guiding principle.
His emphasis was on the problems of everyday morality. Frankly accepting
the change from the old education as a change that could not be avoided,
he sought to formulate a new basis for education in personal morality and
virtue, and as a substitute for the old training for service to the State.
He taught by conversation, engaging men in argument as he met them in the
street, and showing to them their ignorance (R. 9). Even in Athens, where
free speech was enjoyed more than anywhere else in the world at that time,
such a shrewd questioner would naturally make enemies, and in 399 B.C. at
the age of seventy-one, he was condemned to death by the Athenian populace
on the charge of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens.

[Illustration: FIG. 12 SOCRATES (469-399 B.C.)
(After a marble bust in the Vatican Gallery, at Rome)]

Socrates' greatest disciple was a citizen of wealth by the name of Plato,
who had abandoned a political career for the charms of philosophy, and to
him we owe our chief information as to the work and aims of Socrates. In
386 B.C. he founded the Academy, where he passed almost forty years in
lecturing and writing. His school, which formed a model for others,
consisted of a union of teachers and students who possessed in common a
chapel, library, lecture-rooms, and living-rooms. Philosophy, mathematics,
and science were taught, and women as well as men were admitted.

Other schools of importance in Athens were the Lyceum, founded in 335 B.C.
by a foreign-born pupil of Plato's by the name of Aristotle, who did a
remarkable work in organizing the known knowledge of his time; [7] the
school of the Stoics, founded by Zeno in 308 B.C.; and the school of the
Epicureans, founded by Epicurus in 306 B.C. Each of these schools offered
a philosophical solution of the problem of life, and Plato and Aristotle
wrote treatises on education as well. Each school evolved into a form of
religious brotherhood which perpetuated the organization after the death
of the master. In time these became largely schools for expounding the
philosophy of the founder.

[Illustration: FIG. 13. EVOLUTION OF THE GREEK UNIVERSITY]

THE UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS. Coincident with the founding of these schools
and the political events we have previously recorded, certain further
changes in Athenian education were taking place. The character of the
changes in the education before the age of sixteen we have described. As a
result in part of the development of the schools of the Sophists, which
were in themselves only attempts to meet fundamental changes in Athenian
life, the education of youths after sixteen tended to become literary,
rather than physical and military. The Ephebic period of service (from
eighteen to twenty) was at first reduced from two years to one, and after
the Macedonian conquest, in 338 B.C., when there was no longer an Athenian
State to serve or protect, the entire period of training was made
optional. The Ephebic corps was now opened to foreigners, and in time
became merely a fashionable semi-military group. Instead of the military
training, attendance at the lectures of the philosophical schools was now
required, and attendance at the rhetorical schools was optional. Later the
philosophical schools were granted public support by the Athenian
Assembly, professorships were created over which the Assembly exercised
supervision, the rhetorical and philosophical schools were gradually
merged, the study years were extended from two to six, or seven, a form of
university life as regards both students and professors was developed, and
what has since been termed "The University of Athens" was evolved. Figure
13 shows how this evolution took place.

As Athens lost in political power her citizens turned their attention to
making their city a center of world learning. This may be said to have
been accomplished by 200 B.C. Though Greece had long since become a
Macedonian province, and was soon to pass under the control of Rome, the
so-called University of Athens was widely known and much frequented for
the next three hundred years, and continued in existence until finally
closed, as a center of pagan thought, by the edict of the Roman-Christian
Emperor, Justinian, in 529 A.D. Though reduced to the rank of a Roman
provincial town, Athens long continued to be a city of letters and a
center of philosophic and scientific instruction.

SPREAD AND INFLUENCE OF GREEK HIGHER EDUCATION. Alexander the Great
rendered a very important service in uniting the western Orient and the
eastern Mediterranean into a common world empire, and in establishing
therein a common language, literature, philosophy, a common interest, and
a common body of scientific knowledge and law. It was his hope to create a
new empire, in which the distinction between European and Asiatic should
pass away. No less than seventy cities were established with a view to
holding his empire together. These served to spread Hellenic culture.
Greek schools, Greek theaters, Greek baths, and Greek institutions of
every type were to be found in practically all of them, and the Greek
tongue was heard in them all. With Alexander the Great the history of
Greek life, culture, and learning merges into that of the history of the
ancient world. Everywhere throughout the new empire Greek philosophers and
scientists, architects and artists, merchants and colonists, followed
behind the Macedonian armies, spreading Greek civilization and becoming
the teachers of an enlarged world. [8] "Greek cities stretched from the
Nile to the Indus, and dotted the shores of the Black and the Caspian
seas. The Greek language, once the tongue of a petty people, grew to be a
universal language of culture, spoken even by barbarian lips, and the art,
the science, the literature, the principles of politics and philosophy,
developed in isolation by the Greek mind, henceforth became the heritage
of many nations." [9]

Greek universities were established at Pergamum and Tarsus in Asia Minor;
at Rhodes on the island of that name in the Aegean; and at the newly
founded city of Alexandria in Egypt. Antioch, in Syria, became another
important center of Greek influence and learning. A large library was
developed at Pergamum, and it was here that writing on prepared skins of
animals [10] was begun, from which the term "parchment" (originally "per-
gament") comes. It was also at Pergamum that Galen (born c. 130 A.D.)
organized what was then known of medical science, and his work remained
the standard treatise for more than a thousand years. Rhodes became a
famous center for instruction in oratory. During Roman days many eminent
men, among whom were Cassius, Caesar, and Cicero, studied oratory here.

[Illustration:  FIG. 14 THE GREEK UNIVERSITY WORLD]

MINGLING OF ORIENT AND OCCIDENT AT ALEXANDRIA. The most famous of all
these Greek institutions, however, was the University of Alexandria, which
gradually sapped Athens as a center of learning and became the
intellectual capital of the world. The greatest library of manuscripts the
world had ever known was collected together here. [11] It is said to have
numbered over 700,000 volumes. These included Greek, Jewish, Egyptian, and
Oriental works. In connection with the library was the museum, where men
of letters and investigators were supported at royal expense. These two
constituted an institution so like a university that it has been given
that name. Alexandria became not only a great center of learning, but,
still more important, the chief mingling place for Greek, Jew, Egyptian,
Roman, and Oriental, and here Greek philosophy, Hebrew and Christian
religion, and Oriental faith and philosophy met and mixed. It was this
mingled civilization and culture, all tinged through and through with the
Greek, with which the Romans came in contact as they pushed their
conquering armies into the eastern Mediterranean (R. 10).

[Illustration: FIG. 15. THE KNOWN WORLD ABOUT 150 A.D.
A map by Ptolemy, geographer and astronomer at Alexandria. Compare this
with the map on page 4, and note the progress in geographical discovery
which had been made during the intervening centuries.]

CHARACTER OF ALEXANDRIAN LEARNING. The great advances in knowledge made at
Alexandria were in mathematics, geography, and science. The method of
scientific investigation worked out by Aristotle at Athens was introduced
and used. Instead of speculating as to phenomena and causes, as had been
the earlier Greek practice, observation and experiment now became the
rule. Euclid (c. 323-283 B.C.) opened a school at Alexandria as early as
300 B.C., and there worked out the geometry which is still used in our
schools. Archimedes (287-212 B.C.), who studied under Euclid, made many
important discoveries and advances in mechanics and physics. Eratosthenes
(226-196 B.C.), librarian at Alexandria, is famous as a geographer [12]
and astronomer, and made some studies in geology as well. Ptolemy (b.?; d.
168 A.D.) here completed his Mechanism of the Heavens (_Syntaxis_) in 138
A.D., and this became the standard astronomy in Europe for nearly fifteen
hundred years, while his geography was used in the schools until well into
the fifteenth century. The map of the known world, shown in Figure 15, was
made by him. Hipparcus, the Newton of the Greeks, studied the heavens both
at Alexandria and Rhodes, and counted the stars and arranged them in
constellations. Many advances also were made in the study of medicine, the
Alexandrian schools having charts, models, and dissecting rooms for the
study of the human body, The functions of the brain, nerves, and heart
were worked out there.

Except in science and mathematics, though, the creative ability of the
earlier Greeks was now largely absent. Research, organization, and comment
upon what had previously been done rather was the rule. Still much
important work was done here. Books were collected, copied, and preserved,
and texts were edited and purified from errors. Here grammar, criticism,
prosody, and mythology were first developed into sciences. The study of
archaeology was begun, and the first dictionaries were made. The
translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek was begun for the benefit
of the Alexandrian Jews who had forgotten their Mother tongue, this being
the origin of the famous _Septuagint_ [13] version of the Old Testament.
It is owing to these Alexandrian scholars, also, that we now possess the
theory of Greek accents, and have good texts of Homer and other Greek
writers.

ALEXANDRIA SAPPED IN TURN. In 30 B.C. Alexandria, too, came under Roman
rule and was, in turn, gradually sapped by Rome. Greek influence
continued, but the interest became largely philosophical. Ultimately
Alexandria became the seat of a metaphysical school of Christian theology,
and the scene of bitter religious controversies. In 330 A.D.,
Constantinople was founded on the site of the earlier Byzantium, and soon
thereafter Greek scholars transferred their interest to it and made it a
new center of Greek learning. There Greek science, literature, and
philosophy were preserved for ten centuries, and later handed back to a
Europe just awakening from the long intellectual night of the Middle Ages.
In 640 A.D. Alexandria was taken by the Mohammedans, and the university
ceased to exist. The great library was destroyed, furnishing, it is said,
"fuel sufficient for four thousand public baths for a period of six
months," and Greek learning was extinguished in the western world.

OUR DEBT TO HELLAS. As a political power the Greek States left the world
nothing of importance. As a people they were too individualistic, and
seemed to have a strange inability to unite for political purposes. To the
new power slowly forming to the westward--Rome--was left the important
task, which the Greek people were never able to accomplish, of uniting
civilization into one political whole. The world conquest that Greece made
was intellectual. As a result, her contribution to civilization was
artistic, literary, philosophical, and scientific, but not political. The
Athenian Greeks were a highly artistic and imaginative rather than a
practical people. They spent their energy on other matters than government
and conquest. As a result the world will be forever indebted to them for
an art and a literature of incomparable beauty and richness which still
charms mankind; a philosophy which deeply influenced the early Christian
religion, and has ever since tinged the thinking of the western world; and
for many important beginnings in scientific knowledge which were lost for
ages to a world that had no interest in or use for science. So deeply has
our whole western civilization been tinctured by Greek thought that one
enthusiastic writer has exclaimed,--"Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves in this world which is not Greek in its origin." [14] (R.
11)

In education proper the old Athenian education offers us many lessons of
importance that we of to-day may well heed. In the emphasis they placed on
moral worth, education of the body as well as the mind, and moderation in
all things, they were much ahead of us. Their schools became a type for
the cities of the entire Mediterranean world, being found from the Black
Sea south to the Persian Gulf and westward to Spain. When Rome became a
world empire the Greek school system was adopted, and in modified form
became dominant in Rome and throughout the provinces, while the
universities of the Greek cities for long furnished the highest form of
education for ambitious Roman youths. In this way Greek influence was
spread throughout the Mediterranean world. The higher learning of the
Greeks, preserved first at Athens and Alexandria, and later at
Constantinople, was finally handed back to the western world at the time
of the Italian Revival of Learning, after Europe had in part recovered
from the effects of the barbarian deluge which followed the downfall of
Rome.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Try to picture what might have been the result for western civilization
had the small and newly-developed democratic civilization of Greece been
crushed by the Persians at the time they overran the Greek peninsula.

2. Do periods of great political, commercial, and intellectual expansion
usually subject old systems of morality and education to severe strain?
Illustrate.

3. Why was the change in the type of Athenian education during the Ephebic
years a natural and even a necessary one for the new Athens?

4. Do you understand that the system of training before the Ephebic years
was also seriously changed, or was the change largely a re-shaping and
extension of the education of youths after sixteen?

5. Were the Sophists a good addition to the Athenian instructing force, or
not? Why?

6. How may a State establish a corrective for such a flood of
individualism as overwhelmed Greece, and still allow individual
educational initiative and progress?

7. Do we as a nation face danger from the flood of individualism we have
encouraged in the past? How is our problem like and unlike that of Athens
after the Peloponnesian War?

8. What is the place in Greek life and thought of the ideal treatises on
education written by Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle, after the flood of
individualism had set in?

9. In what ways was the conquest of Alexander good for world civilization?

10. Of what importance is it, in the history of our western civilization,
that Greek thought had so thoroughly permeated the eastern Mediterranean
world before Roman armies conquered the region?

11. Picture for yourself the great intellectual advances of the Greeks by
contrasting the tribal preparedness-type of education of the early Greek
States and the learning possessed by the scholars of the University at
Alexandria.

12. Compare the spread of Greek language and knowledge throughout the
eastern Mediterranean world, following the conquests of Alexander, with
the spread of the English language and ideas as to government throughout
the modern world.

CHAPTER III

THE EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME


I. THE ROMANS AND THEIR MISSION

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROMAN STATE. About the time that the Hellenes, in the
City-States of the Greek peninsula, had brought their civilization to its
Golden Age, another branch of the great Aryan race, which had previously
settled in the Italian peninsula, had begun the creation of a new
civilization there which was destined to become extended and powerful. At
the beginning of recorded history we find a number of tribes of this
branch of the Aryan race settled in different parts of Italy, as is shown
in Figure 16. Slowly, but gradually, the smallest of these divisions, the
Latins, extended its rule over the other tribes, and finally over the
Greek settlements to the south and the Gauls to the north, so that by 201
B.C. the entire Italian peninsula had become subject to the City-State
government at Rome.

[Illustration: FIG. 16. THE EARLY PEOPLES OF ITALY, AND THE EXTENSION OF
THE ROMAN POWER
In 509 B.C. Attica opened her citizenship to all free inhabitants, and
half a century later the Golden Age of Greece was in full swing. By 338
B.C. Greece's glory had departed. Philip of Macedon had become master, and
its political freedom was over. By 264 B.C. the center of Greek life and
thought had been transferred to Alexandria, and Rome's great expansion had
begun.]

[Illustration: FIG. 17. THE PRINCIPAL ROMAN ROADS]

By a wise policy of tolerance, patience, conciliation, and assimilation
the Latins gradually became the masters of all Italy. Unlike the Greek
City-States, Rome seemed to possess a natural genius for the art of
government. Upon the people she conquered she bestowed the great gift of
Roman citizenship, and she attached them to her by granting local
government to their towns and by interfering as little as possible with
their local manners, speech, habits, and institutions. By founding
colonies among them and by building excellent military roads to them, she
insured her rule, and by kindly and generous treatment she bound the
different Italian peoples ever closer and closer to the central government
at Rome. By a most wonderful understanding of the psychology of other
peoples, new in the world before the work of Rome, and not seen again
until the work of the English in the nineteenth century, Rome gradually
assimilated the peoples of the Italian peninsula and in time amalgamated
them into a single Roman race. In speech, customs, manners, and finally in
blood she Romanized the different tribes and brought them under her
leadership. Later this same process was extended to Spain, Gaul, and even
to far-off Britain.

A CONCRETE, PRACTICAL PEOPLE. The Roman people were a concrete, practical,
constructive nation of farmers and herdsmen (R. 14), merchants and
soldiers, governors and executives. The whole of the early struggle of the
Latins to extend their rule and absorb the other tribes of the peninsula
called for practical rulers--warriors who were at the same time
constructive statesmen and executives who possessed power and insight,
energy, and personality. The long struggle for political and social
rights, [1] carried on by the common people (_plebeians_) with the ruling
class (_patricians_), tended early to shape their government along rough
but practical lines, [2] and to elevate law and orderly procedure among
the people. The later extension of the Empire to include many distant
lands--how vast the Roman Empire finally became may be seen from the map
on the following page--called still more for a combination of force,
leadership, tolerance, patience, executive power, and insight into the
psychology of subject people to hold such a vast empire together. Only a
great, creative people, working along very practical lines, could have
used and used so well the opportunity which came to Rome [3]

[Illustration: FIG. 18. THE GREAT EXTENT OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
The map shows the Roman Empire as it was by the end of the first century
A.D., and the tribes shown beyond the frontier are as they were at the
beginning of the fourth century A.D. It was 2500 miles, air line, from the
eastern end of the Black Sea to the western coasts of Spain, 1400 miles
from Rome to Palestine, and 1100 miles from Rome to northern Britain. To
maintain order in this vast area Rome depended on the loyalty of her
subjects, the strength of her armies, her military roads, and a messenger
service by horse, yet throughout this vast area she imposed her law and a
unified government for centuries.]

THE GREAT MISSION OF ROME. Had Rome tried to impose her rule and her ways
and her mode of thought on her subject people, and to reduce them to
complete subjection to her, as the modern German and Austrian Empires, for
example, tried to do with the peoples who came under their control, the
Roman Empire could never have been created, and what would have saved
civilization from complete destruction during the period of the barbarian
invasions is hard to see. Instead, Rome treated her subjects as her
friends, and not as conquered peoples; led them to see that their
interests were identical with hers; gave them large local independence and
freedom in government, under her strong control of general affairs; opened
up her citizenship [4] and the line of promotion in the State to her
provincials; [5] and won them to the peace and good order which she
everywhere imposed by the advantages she offered through a common
language, common law, common coinage, common commercial arrangements,
common state service, and the common treatment of all citizens of every
race. [6] In consequence, the provincial was willingly absorbed into the
common Roman race [7]--absorbed in dress, manners, religion, political and
legal institutions, family names, and, most important of all, in language.
As a result, race pride and the native tongues very largely disappeared,
and Latin became the spoken language of all except the lower classes
throughout the whole of the Western Empire. Only in the eastern
Mediterranean, where the Hellenic tongue and the Hellenic civilization
still dominated, did the Latin language make but little headway, and here
Rome had the good sense not to try to impose her speech or her culture.
Instead she absorbed the culture of the East, while the East accepted in
return the Roman government and Roman law, and Latin in time became the
language of the courts and of government.

Having stated thus briefly the most prominent characteristics of the Roman
people, and indicated their great work for civilization, let us turn back
and trace the development of such educational system as existed among
them, see in what it consisted, how it modified the life and habits of
thinking of the Roman people, and what educational organization or
traditions Rome passed on to western civilization.


II. THE PERIOD OF HOME EDUCATION

THE EARLY ROMANS AND THEIR TRAINING. In the early history of the Romans
there were no schools, and it was not until about 300 B.C. that even
primary schools began to develop. What education was needed was imparted
in the home or in the field and in the camp, and was of a very simple
type. Certain virtues were demanded--modesty, firmness, prudence, piety,
courage, seriousness, and regard for duty--and these were instilled both
by precept and example. Each home was a center of the religious life, and
of civic virtue and authority. In it the father was a high priest, with
power of life and death over wife and children. He alone conversed with
the gods and prepared the sacrifices. The wife and mother, however, held a
high place in the home and in the training of the children, the marriage
tie being regarded as very sacred. She also occupied a respected position
in society, and was complete mistress of the house (R. 17).

The religion of the city was an outgrowth of that of the home. Virtue,
courage, duty, justice--these became the great civic virtues. Their
religion, both family and state, lacked the beauty and stately ceremonial
of the Greeks, lacked that lofty faith and aspiration after virtue that
characterized the Hebrew and the later Christian faith, was singularly
wanting in awe and mystery, and was formal and mechanical and practical
[8] in character, but it exercised a great influence on these early
peoples and on their conceptions of their duty to the State.

The father trained the son for the practical duties of a man and a
citizen; the mother trained the daughter to become a good housekeeper,
wife, and mother. Morality, character, obedience to parents and to the
State, and whole-hearted service were emphasized. The boy's father taught
him to read, write, and count. Stories of those who had done great deeds
for the State were told, and martial songs were learned and sung. After
450 B.C. every boy had to learn the Laws of the Twelve Tables (R. 12), and
be able to explain their meaning (R. 13). As the boy grew older he
followed his father in the fields and in the public place and listened to
the conversation of men. [9] If the son of a patrician he naturally
learned much more from his father, by reason of his larger knowledge and
larger contact with men of affairs and public business, than if he were
the son of a plebeian. Through games as a boy, and later in the exercises
of the fields and the camps, the boy gained what physical training he
received. [10]

[Illustration: FIG. 19. A ROMAN FATHER INSTRUCTING HIS SON
(From a Roman Sarcophagus)]

EDUCATION BY DOING. It was largely an education by doing, as was that of
the old Greek period, though entirely different in character. Either by
apprenticeship to the soldier, farmer, or statesman, or by participation
in the activities of a citizen, was the training needed imparted. Its
purpose was to produce good fathers, citizens, and soldiers. [11] Its
ideals were found in the real and practical needs of a small State, where
the ability to care for one's self was a necessary virtue. To be healthy
and strong, to reverence the gods and the institutions of the State, to
obey his parents and the laws, to be proud of his family connections and
his ancestors, to be brave and efficient in war, to know how to farm or to
manage a business, were the aims and ends of this early training. It
produced a nation of citizens who willingly subordinated themselves to the
interests of the State, [12] a nation of warriors who brought all Italy
under their rule, a calculating, practical people who believed themselves
destined to become the conquerors and rulers of the world, and a reserved
and proud race, trained to govern and to do business, but not possessed of
lofty ideals or large enthusiasms in life (Rs. 15, 16).


III. THE TRANSITION TO SCHOOL EDUCATION

BEGINNINGS OF SCHOOL EDUCATION. Up to about 300 B.C. education had been
entirely in the home, and in the activities of the fields and the State.
It was a period of personal valor and stern civic virtue, in a rather
primitive type of society, as yet but little in contact with the outside
world, and little need of any other type of training had been felt. By the
end of the third century B.C., the influence of contact with the Greek
cities of southern Italy and Sicily (_Magna Graecia_), and the influence
of the extensive conquests of Alexander the Great in the eastern
Mediterranean (334-323 B.C.), had begun to be felt in Italy. By that time
Greek had become the language of commerce and diplomacy throughout the
Mediterranean, and Greek scholars and tradesmen had begun to frequent
Rome. By 303 B.C. it seems certain that a few private teachers had set up
primary schools at Rome to supplement the home training, and had begun the
introduction of the pedagogue as a fashionable adjunct to attract
attention to their schools. These schools, however, were only a fad at
first, and were patronized only by a few of the wealthy citizens. Up to
about 250 B.C., at least, Roman education remained substantially as it had
been in the preceding centuries. Reading, writing, declamation, chanting,
and the Laws of the Twelve Tables still constituted the subject-matter of
instruction, and the old virtues continued to be emphasized.

By the middle of the third century B.C. Rome had expanded its rule to
include nearly all the Italian peninsula (see Figure 16), and was
transforming itself politically from a little rural City-State into an
Empire, with large world relationships. A knowledge of Greek now came to
be demanded both for diplomatic and for business reasons, and the need of
a larger culture, to correspond with the increased importance of the
State, began to be felt by the wealthier and better-educated classes.
Greek scholars, brought in as captured slaves from the Greek colonies of
southern Italy, soon began to be extensively employed as teachers and as
secretaries.

About 233 B.C., Livius Andronicus, who had been brought to Rome as a slave
when Tarentum, one of the Greek cities of southern Italy, was captured,
[13] and who later had obtained his freedom, made a translation of the
Odyssey into Latin, and became a teacher of Latin and Greek at Rome. This
had a wonderful effect in developing schools and a literary atmosphere at
Rome. The _Odyssey_ at once became the great school textbook, in time
supplanting the Twelve Tables, and literary and school education now
rapidly developed. The Latin language became crystallized in form, and
other Greek works were soon translated. The beginnings of a native Latin
literature were now made. Greek higher schools were opened, many Greek
teachers and slaves offered instruction, and the Hellenic scheme of
culture, as it had previously developed in Attica, soon became the fashion
at Rome.

CHANGES IN NATIONAL IDEALS. The second century B.C. was even more a period
of rapid change in all phases and aspects of Roman life. During this
century Rome became a world empire, annexing Spain, Carthage, Illyria, and
Greece, and during the century that followed she subjugated northern
Africa, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Gaul to the Elbe and the Danube (see Figure
18). Rome soon became mistress of the whole Mediterranean world. Her ships
plied the seas, her armies and governors ruled the land. The introduction
of wealth, luxuries, and slaves from the new provinces, which followed
their capture, soon had a very demoralizing influence upon the people.
Private and public religion and morality rapidly declined; religion came
to be an empty ceremonial; divorce became common; wealth and influence
ruled the State; slaves became very cheap and abundant, and were used for
almost every type of service. From a land of farmers of small farms,
sturdy and self-supporting, who lived simply, reared large families,
feared the gods, respected the State, and made an honest living, it became
a land of great estates and wealthy men, and the self-respecting peasantry
were transformed into soldiers for foreign wars, or joined the rabble in
the streets of Rome. [14] Wealth became the great desideratum, and the
great avenue to this was through the public service, either as army
commanders and governors, or as public men who could sway the multitude
and command votes and influence. Manifestly the old type of education was
not intended to meet such needs, and now in Rome, as previously in Athens,
a complete transformation in the system of training for the young took
place. The imaginative and creative Athenians, when confronted by a great
change in national ideals, evolved a new type of education adapted to the
new needs of the time; the unimaginative and practical Romans merely
adopted that which the Athenians had created.

THE HELLENIZATION OF ROME. The result was the Hellenization of the
intellectual life of Rome, making complete the Hellenization of the
Mediterranean world. After the fall of Greece, in 146 B.C., a great influx
of educated Greeks took place. As the Latin poet Horace expressed it:

  Captive Greece took captive her rude conqueror,
  And brought the arts to Latium.

So completely did the Greek educational system seem to meet the needs of
the changed Roman State that at first the Greek schools were adopted
bodily--Greek language, pedagogue, higher schools of rhetoric and
philosophy, and all--and the schools were in reality Greek schools but
slightly modified to meet the needs of Rome. _Gymnasia_ were erected, and
wealthy Romans, as well as youths, began to spend their leisure in
studying Greek and in trying to learn gymnastic exercises.

In time the national pride and practical sense of the Romans led them to
open so-called "culture schools" of their own, modeled after the Greek.
The Latin language then replaced the Greek as the vehicle of instruction,
though Greek was still studied extensively, and Rome began the development
of a system of private-school instruction possessing some elements that
were native to Roman life and Roman needs.

[Illustration: FIG. 20. CATO THE ELDER (234-149 B.C.)]

STRUGGLE AGAINST, AND FINAL VICTORY. That this great change in national
ideals and in educational practice was accepted without protest should not
be imagined. Plutarch and other writers appealed to the family as the
center for all true education. Cato the elder, who died in 149 B.C.,
labored hard to stem the Hellenic tide. He wrote the first Roman book on
education, in part to show what education a good citizen needed as an
orator, husbandman, jurist, and warrior, and in part as a protest against
Hellenic innovations. In 167 B.C., the first library was founded in Rome,
with books brought from Greece by the conqueror Paulus Emilius. In 161
B.C., the Roman Senate directed the Praetor to see "that no philosophers
or rhetoricians be suffered in Rome" (R. 20 a), but the edict could not be
enforced. In 92 B.C., the Censors issued an edict expressing their
disapproval of such schools (R. 20 b). By 100 B.C., the Hellenic victory
was complete, and the Graeco-Roman school system had taken form. In 27
B.C., Rome ceased to be a Republic and became an Empire, and under the
Emperors the professors of the new learning were encouraged and protected,
higher schools were established in the provinces, literature and
philosophy were opened as possible careers, and the Greek language,
literature, and learning were spread, under Roman imperial protection, to
every corner of the then civilized world. This victory of Hellenic thought
and learning at Rome, viewed in the light of the future history of the
civilization of the world, was an event of large importance.


IV. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AS FINALLY ESTABLISHED

THE LUDUS, OR PRIMARY SCHOOL. The elementary school, known as the _ludus_,
or _ludus literarum_, the teacher of which was known as a _ludi magister_,
was the beginning or primary school of the scheme as finally evolved. This
corresponded to the school of the Athenian _grammatist_, and like it the
instruction consisted of reading, writing, and counting. These schools
were open to both sexes, but were chiefly frequented by boys. They were
entered at the age of seven, sometimes six, and covered the period up to
twelve. Reading and writing were taught by much the same methods as in the
Greek schools, and approximately the same writing materials were used.
Something of the same difficulty was experienced also in mastering the
reading art (R. 21). Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek historian who
lived in Rome for twenty-two years, during the first century B.C., has
left us a clear description of the Roman method of teaching reading:

    When we learned to read was it not necessary at first to know the name
    of the letters, their shape, their value in syllables, their
    differences, then the words and their case, their quantity long or
    short, their accent, and the rest?

    Arrived at this point we began to read and write, slowly at first and
    syllable by syllable. Some time afterwards, the forms being
    sufficiently engraved on our memory, we read more cursorily, in the
    elementary book, then in all sorts of books, finally with incredible
    quickness and without making any mistake.

[Illustration: FIG. 21. ROMAN WRITING-MATERIALS.
Inkstand, pen, letter, box of manuscripts, wax tablets, stylus.]

Writing seems rather to have followed reading, and, as in the Greek
schools, the pupils copied down from dictation and made their own books
(_dictata_). Literature received no such emphasis in the elementary
schools of Rome as in those of the Greeks, and the _palaestra_ of the
Greeks was not reproduced at Rome.

Due in part to the practical character of the Roman people, to the
established habit of keeping careful household accounts, to the
difficulties of their system of calculation, [15] to the practice of
finger reckoning, and to the vast commercial and financial interests that
the Romans formed throughout the world which they conquered, arithmetic
became a subject of fundamental importance in their schools, and much time
was given to securing perfection in calculation and finger reckoning. [16]
Hence it occupied a place of large importance in the primary school. An
abacus or counting-board was used, similar to the one shown in Figure 22,
and Horace mentions a bag of stones (_calculi_) as a part of a schoolboy's
equipment.

[Illustration: FIG. 22. A ROMAN COUNTING-BOARD.
Pebbles were used, those nearest the numbered dividing partition being
counted. Each pebble above when moved downward counted five of those in
the same division below. The board now shows 8,760,254.]

THE _LUDI MAGISTER_. The _ludi magister_ at Rome held a position even less
enviable than that held by the _grammatist_ at Athens. "The starveling
Greek," who was glad to barter his knowledge for the certainty of a good
dinner, was sneered at by many Roman writers. Many slaves were engaged in
this type of instruction, bringing in fees for their owners. It was not
regarded as of importance that the teachers of these schools be of high
grade. The establishment of and attendance at these primary schools was
wholly voluntary, and the children in them probably represented but a
small percentage of those of school age in the total population. These
schools became quite common in the Italian cities, and in time were found
in the provincial cities of the Empire as well. They remained, however,
entirely private-adventure undertakings, the State doing nothing toward
encouraging their establishment, supervising the instruction in them, or
requiring attendance at them. They were in no sense free schools, nor were
the prices for instruction fixed, as in our private schools of to-day.
Instead, the pupil made a present to the master, usually at some
understood rate, though some masters left the size of the fee to the
liberality of their pupils. [17] The pedagogue, copied from Greece, was
nearly always an old or infirm slave of the family.

[Illustration: FIG. 23. A ROMAN PRIMARY SCHOOL(_Ludus_)
(From a fresco found at Herculaneum). This shows a school held in a
portico of a house.]

The schools were held anywhere--in a portico (see Figure 23), in a shed or
booth in front of a house, in a store, or in a recessed corner shut in by
curtains. A chair for the master, benches for the pupils, an outer room
for cloaks and for the pedagogues to wait in, and a bundle of rods
(_ferula_) constituted the necessary equipment. The pupils brought with
them boxes containing writing-materials, book-rolls, and reckoning-stones.
Schools began early in the morning, pupils in winter going with lanterns
to their tasks. There was much flogging of children, and in Martial we
find an angry epigram which he addressed to a schoolmaster who disturbed
his sleep (R. 23 a).

THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. Secondary or Latin grammar schools, under a
_grammaticus_, and covering instruction from the age of twelve to sixteen,
had become clearly differentiated from the primary schools under a _ludi
magister_ by the time of the death of Cato, 149 B.C. At first this higher
instruction began in the form of private tutors, probably in the homes of
the wealthy, and Greek was the language taught. By the beginning of the
first century B.C., however, Latin secondary schools began to arise, and
in time these too spread to all the important cities of the Empire.
Attendance at them was wholly voluntary, and was confined entirely to the
children of the well-to-do classes. The teachers were Greeks, or Latins
who had been trained by the Greeks. Each teacher taught as he wished, but
the schools throughout the Empire came to be much the same in character.
The course of study consisted chiefly of instruction in grammar and
literature, the purpose being to secure such a mastery of the Latin
language and Greek and Latin literatures as might be most helpful in
giving that broader culture now recognized as the mark of an educated man,
and in preparing the young Roman to take up the life of an orator and
public official (R. 24). Both Greek and Latin secondary schools were in
existence, and Quintilian, the foremost Roman writer on educational
practice, recommends attendance at the Greek school first.

Grammar was studied first, and was intended to develop correctness in the
use of speech. With its careful study of words, phonetic changes, drill on
inflections, and practice in composing and paragraphing, this made a
strong appeal to the practical Roman and became a favorite study.
Literature followed, and was intended to develop an appreciation for
literary style, elevate thought, expand one's knowledge, and, by
memorization and repetition, to train the powers of expression. The method
practiced was much as follows: The selection was carefully read first by
the teacher, and then by the pupils. [18] After the reading the selection
was gone over again and the historical, geographical, and mythological
allusions were carefully explained by the teacher. [19] The text was next
critically examined, to point out where and how it might be improved and
its expressions strengthened, and much paraphrasing of it was engaged in.
Finally the study of the selection was rounded out by _a judgment_--that
is, a critical estimate of the work, a characterization of the author's
style, and a resume of his chief merits and defects. The foundations were
here laid for Grammar and Rhetoric as the great studies of the Middle
Ages.

Homer and Menander were the favorite authors in Greek, and Vergil, Horace,
Sallust, and Livy in Latin, with much use of _Aesop's Fables_ for work in
composition. The pupils made their own books from dictation, though in
later years educated slave labor became so cheap that the copying and sale
of books was organized into a business at Rome, and it was possible for
the children of wealthy parents to own their own books. Grammar,
composition, elocution, ethics, history, mythology, and geography were all
comprehended in the instruction in grammar and literature in the secondary
schools. A little music was added at times, to help the pupil intone his
reading and declamation. A little geometry and astronomy were also
included, for their practical applications. The athletic exercises of the
Greeks were rejected, as contributing to immorality and being a waste of
time and strength. In a sense these schools were finishing schools for
Roman youths who went to any school at all, much as are our high schools
of to-day for the great bulk of American children. The schools were better
housed than those of the _ludi_, and the masters were of a better quality
and received larger fees. Like the elementary schools, the State exercised
no supervision or control over these schools or the teachers or pupils in
them.

THE SCHOOLS OF RHETORIC. Up to this point the schools established had been
for practical and useful information (the primary schools) or cultural
(the grammar or secondary schools). On top of these a higher and
professional type of school was next developed, to train youths in
rhetoric and oratory, preparatory to the great professions of law and
public life at Rome. [20] These schools were direct descendants of the
Greek rhetorical schools, which evolved from the schools of the Sophists.
Suetonius [21] tells us that:

    Rhetoric, also, as well as grammar, was not introduced amongst us
    till a late period, and with still more difficulty, inasmuch as we
    find that, at times, the practice of it was even prohibited. [22] ...
    However, by slow degrees, rhetoric manifested itself to be a useful
    and honorable study, and many persons devoted themselves to it both as
    a means of defense and of acquiring a reputation. In consequence,
    public favor was so much attracted to the study of rhetoric that a
    vast number of professional and learned men devoted themselves to it;
    and it flourished to such a degree that some of them raised themselves
    by it to the rank of senators and to the highest offices.

These schools, the teachers of which were known as _rhetors_, furnished a
type of education representing a sort of collegiate education for the
period. They were oratorical in purpose, because the orator had become the
Roman ideal of a well-educated man (R. 24). During the life of the
Republic the orator found many opportunities for the constructive use of
his ability, and all young men ambitious to enter law or politics found
the training of these schools a necessary prerequisite. They were attended
for two or three years by boys over sixteen, but only the wealthier and
more aristocratic families could afford to send their boys to them.

In addition to oratorical and some legal training, these schools included
a further linguistic and literary training, some mathematical and
scientific knowledge, and even some philosophy. The famous "Seven Liberal
Arts" of the Middle Ages--Grammar, Rhetoric, and Dialectic; Music,
Arithmetic, Geometry, and Astronomy--all seem to have been included in the
instruction of these schools. [23] The great studies, though, were the
first three and some Law, Music being studied largely to help with
gestures and to train the voice, Geometry to aid in settling lawsuits
relating to land, Dialectic (logic) to aid in detecting fallacies, and
Astronomy to understand the movements of the heavenly bodies and the
references of literary writers. [24] There was much work in debate and in
the declamation of ethical and political material the fine distinctions in
Roman Law and Ethics were brought out, [25] and there was much drill in
preparing and delivering speeches and much attention given to the factors
involved in the preparation and delivery of a successful oration (R. 25).

[Illustration: FIG. 24. A ROMAN SCHOOL OF RHETORIC.
This picture, which has been drawn from a description, shows a much better
type of school than that of the _ludi_.]

These schools became very popular as institutions of higher learning, and
continued so even after the later Emperors, by seizing the power of the
State, had taken away the inspiration that comes from a love of freedom
and had thus deprived the rhetorical art of practical value. The work of
the schools then became highly stilted and artificial in character, and
oratory then came to be cultivated largely as a fine art. [26] Men
educated in these schools came to boast that they could speak with equal
effectiveness on either side of any question, and the art came to depend
on the use of many and big words and on the manners of the stage. Such
ideals naturally destroyed the value of these schools, and stopped
intellectual progress so far as they contributed to it.

Much was done by the later Emperors to encourage these schools, and they
too came to exist in almost every provincial city in the Empire. Often
they were supported by the cities in which they were located. The Emperor
Vespasian, about 75 A.D. began the practice of paying, from the Imperial
Treasury, the salaries of grammarians and rhetoricians [27] at Rome.
Antoninus Pius, who ruled as Emperor from 138 to 161 A.D., extended
payment to the provinces, gave to these teachers the privileges of the
senatorial class, and a certain number in each city were exempted from
payment of taxes, support of soldiers, and obligations to military
service. Other Emperors extended these special privileges (R. 26) which
became the basis for the special rights afterwards granted to the
Christian clergy (R. 38) and, still later, to teachers in the universities
(Rs. 101-04).

UNIVERSITY LEARNING. Roman youths desiring still further training could
now journey to the eastward and attend the Greek universities (see Figure
14). A few did so, much as American students in the middle of the
nineteenth century went to Germany for higher study. Athens and Rhodes
were most favored. Brutus, Horace, and Cicero, among others, studied at
Athens; Caesar, Cicero, and Cassius at Rhodes. Later Alexandria was in
favor. In a library founded in the Temple of Peace by Vespasian (ruled 69
to 79 A.D.) the University at Rome had its origin, and in time this
developed into an institution with professors in law, medicine,
architecture, mathematics and mechanics, and grammar and rhetoric in both
the Latin and Greek languages. In this many youths from provincial cities
came to study. The lines of instruction represented nothing, however, in
the way of scientific investigation or creative thought; the instruction
was formal and dogmatic, being largely a further elaboration of what had
previously been well done by the Greeks.

NATURE OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM DEVELOPED. Such was the educational
system which was finally evolved to meet the new cultural needs of the
Roman Empire. In all its foundation elements it was Greek. Having
borrowed--conquered one might almost say--Greek religion, philosophy,
literature, and learning, the Romans naturally borrowed also the school
system that had been evolved to impart this culture. Never before or since
has any people adapted so completely to their own needs the system of
educational training evolved by another. To the Greek basis some
distinctively Roman elements were added to adapt it better to the peculiar
needs of their own people, while on the other hand many of the finer Greek
characteristics were omitted entirely. Having once adopted the Greek plan,
the constructive Roman mind organized it into a system superior to the
original, but in so doing formalized it more than the Greeks had ever done
(R. 19).

[Illustration: FIG. 25. THE ROMAN VOLUNTARY EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, AS FINALLY
EVOLVED]

That the system afforded an opportunity to wealthy Romans to obtain for
their children some understanding and appreciation of the culture of the
Greek world with which their Empire was now in contact, and answered
fairly well the preparatory needs along political and governmental lines
of those Romans who could afford to educate their boys for such careers,
can hardly be doubted (R. 22). Roman writers on education, especially
Cicero (R. 24) and Quintilian (R. 25), give us abundant testimony as to
the value and usefulness of the system evolved in the training of orators
and men for the public service. In the provinces, too, we know that the
schools were very useful in inculcating Roman traditions and in helping
the Romans to assimilate the sons of local princes and leaders. [28]
During the days of the Republic the schools were naturally more useful
than after the establishment of the Empire, and especially after the later
Emperors had stamped out many of the political and civic liberties for the
enjoyment of which the schools prepared. On the other hand, the schools
reached but a small, selected class of youths, trained for only the
political career, and cannot be considered as ever having been general or
as having educated any more than a small percentage of the future citizens
of the State. Many of the important lines of activity in which the Romans
engaged, and which to-day are regarded as monuments to their constructive
skill and practical genius, such as architectural achievements, the
building of roads and aqueducts, the many skilled trades, and the large
commercial undertakings, these schools did nothing to prepare youths for.
The State, unlike Athens, never required education of any one, did not
make what was offered a preparation for citizenship, and made no attempt
to regulate either teachers or instruction until late in the history of
the Empire. Education at Rome was from the first purely a private-
adventure affair, most nearly analogous with us to instruction in music
and dancing. Those who found the education offered of any value could take
it and pay for it; those who did not could let it alone. A few did the
former, the great mass of the Romans the latter. For the great slave class
that developed at Rome there was, of course, no education at all.

RESULTS ON ROMAN LIFE AND GOVERNMENT. Still, out of this private and
tuition system of schools many capable political leaders and executives
came--men who exercised great influence on the history of the State,
fought out her political battles, organized and directed her government at
home and in the provinces, and helped build up that great scheme of
government and law and order which was Rome's most significant
contribution to future civilization. [29] It was in this direction, and in
practical and constructive work along engineering and architectural lines,
that Rome excelled. The Roman genius for government and law and order and
constructive undertakings must be classed, in importance for the future of
civilization in the world, along with the ability of Greece in literature
and philosophy and art. "If," says Professor Adams, "as is sometimes said,
that in the course of history there is no literature which rivals the
Greek except the English, it is perhaps even more true that the Anglo-
Saxon is the only race which can be placed beside the Romans in creative
power and in politics." The conquest of the known world by this practical
and constructive people could not have otherwise than decisively
influenced the whole course of human history, and, coming at the time in
world affairs that it did, the influence on all future civilization of the
work of Rome has been profound. The great political fact which dominated
all the Middle Ages, and shaped the religion and government and
civilization of the time, was the fact that the Roman Empire had been and
had done its work so well.


V. ROME'S CONTRIBUTION TO CIVILIZATION

GREECE AND ROME CONTRASTED. The contrast between the Greeks and the Romans
is marked in almost every particular. The Greeks were an imaginative,
subjective, artistic, and idealistic people, with little administrative
ability and few practical tendencies. The Romans, on the other hand, were
an unimaginative, concrete, practical, and constructive nation. Greece
made its great contribution to world civilization in literature and
philosophy and art; Rome in law and order and government. The Greeks lived
a life of aesthetic enjoyment of the beautiful in nature and art, and
their basis for estimating the worth of a thing was intellectual and
artistic; to the Romans the aesthetic and the beautiful made little
appeal, and their basis for estimating the worth of a thing was
utilitarian. The Greeks worshiped "the beautiful and the good," and tried
to enjoy life rationally and nobly, while the Romans worshiped force and
effectiveness, and lived by rule and authority. The Greeks thought in
personal terms of government and virtue and happiness, while the Romans
thought in general terms of law and duty, and their happiness was rather
in present denial for future gain than in any immediate enjoyment.

As a result the Romans developed no great scholarly or literary
atmosphere, as the Greeks had done at Athens, They built up no great
speculative philosophies, and framed no great theories of government. Even
their literature was, in part, an imitation of the Greek, though
possessing many elements of native strength and beauty. They were a people
who knew how to accomplish results rather than to speculate about means
and ends. Usefulness and effectiveness were with them the criteria of the
worth of any idea or project. They subdued and annexed an empire, they
gave law and order to a primitive world, they civilized and Romanized
barbarian tribes, they built roads connecting all parts of their Empire
that were the best the world had ever known, their aqueducts and bridges
were wonders of engineering skill, their public buildings and monuments
still excite admiration and envy, in many of the skilled trades they
developed tools and processes of large future usefulness, and their
agriculture was the best the world had known up to that time. They were
strong where the Greeks were weak, and weak where the Greeks were strong.

By reason of this difference the two peoples supplemented one another well
in the work of laying the foundations upon which our modern civilization
has been built. Greece created the intellectual and aesthetic ideals and
the culture for our life, while Rome developed the political institutions
under which ideals may be realized and culture may be enjoyed. From the
Greeks and Hebrews our modern life has drawn its great inspirations and
its ideals for life, while from the Romans we have derived our ideals as
to government and obedience to law. One may say that the Romans as a
people specialized in government, law, order, and constructive practical
undertakings, and bequeathed to posterity a wonderful inheritance in
governmental forms, legal codes, commercial processes, and engineering
undertakings, while the Greeks left to us a philosophy, literature, art,
and a world culture which the civilized world will never cease to enjoy.
The Greeks were an imaginative, impulsive, and a joyous people; the Romans
sedate, severe, and superior to the Greeks in persistence and moral force.
The Greeks were ever young; the Romans were always grown and serious men.

ROME'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION. Rome's great contribution, then, was along the
lines just indicated. To this, the school system which became established
in the Roman State contributed only indirectly and but little. The
unification of the ancient world into one Empire, with a common body of
traditions, practices, coinage, speech, and law, which made the triumph of
Christianity possible; the formulation of a body of law [30] which
barbarian tribes accepted, which was studied throughout the Middle Ages,
which formed the basis of the legal system of the mediaeval Church, and
which has largely influenced modern practice; the development of a
language from which many modern tongues have been derived, and which has
modified all western languages; and the perfection of an alphabet which
has become the common property of all nations whose civilization has been
derived from the Greek and Roman--these constitute the chief contributions
of Rome to modern civilization.

Roman city government, too, had been established throughout all the
provincial cities, and this remained after the Empire had passed away. The
municipal corporation, with its charter of rights, has ever since been a
fixed idea in the western world. Roman law, organized into a compact code,
and studied in the law schools of the Middle Ages, has modified our modern
ideas and practices to a degree we scarcely realize. It was accepted by
the German rulers as a permanent thing after they had overrun the Empire,
and it remained as the law of the courts wherever Roman subjects were
tried. Preserved and codified at Constantinople under Justinian in the
sixth century, and re-introduced into western Europe when the study of law
was revived in the newly founded universities in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, Roman law has greatly modified all modern legal
practices and has become the basis of the legal systems of a number of
modern states. [31]

[Illustration: FIG. 26. ORIGIN OF OUR ALPHABET
The German type, like the so-called Old English (see Fig. 45), illustrates
the corruption of letter forms through the copying of manuscripts during
the Middle Ages.]

Of all the Roman contributions to modern civilization perhaps the one that
most completely permeates all our modern life is their alphabet and
speech. Figure 26 shows how our modern alphabet goes back to the old
Roman, which they obtained from the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and
which the Greeks obtained from the still earlier Phoenicians. This
alphabet has become the common property of almost all the civilized world.
[32] In speech, the French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian tongues go
back directly to the Latin, and these are the tongues of Mexico and South
America as well. The English language, which is spoken throughout a large
part of the civilized world, and by one third of its inhabitants, has also
received so many additions from Romanic sources that we to-day scarcely
utter a sentence without using some word once used by the citizens of
ancient Rome.

Among the smaller but nevertheless important contributions which we owe to
Rome, and which were passed on to mediaeval and modern Europe, should be
mentioned certain practical knowledge in agriculture and the mechanic
arts; many inventions and acquired skills in the arts and trades; an
organized sea and land trade and commerce; cleared and improved lands,
good houses, roads and bridges; great architectural and engineering
remains, scattered all through the provinces; the beginnings of the
transformation of the slave into the serf, from which the great body of
freemen of modern Europe later were evolved; and certain educational
conceptions and practices which later profoundly influenced educational
methods and procedure.

How large these contributions were we shall appreciate better as we
proceed with our history. Of the negative contributions, the most
dangerous has been the idea of the rule of one imperial government, which
has inspired the autocratic governments of modern Europe to try to imitate
the world-wide rule of Imperial Rome.

THE WAY PAVED FOR CHRISTIANITY. It was the great civilizing and unifying
work of the Roman State that paved the way for the next great contribution
to the foundations of the structure of our modern civilization--the
contribution of Christianity. Had Italy never been consolidated; had the
barbarian tribes to the north never been conquered and Romanized; had
Spain and Africa and the eastern Mediterranean never known the rule of
Rome; had the Latin language never become the speech of the then civilized
peoples; had Roman armies never imposed law and order throughout an unruly
world; had Roman governors and courts never established common rights and
security; had Roman municipal government never come to be the common type
in the cities of the provinces; had Roman schools in the provincial cities
never trained the foreign citizen in Roman ways and to think Roman
thoughts; had Rome never established free trade and intercourse throughout
her Empire; had Rome never developed processes and skills in agriculture
and the creative arts; had there been no Roman roads and common coinage;
and had Rome not done dozens of other important things to unify and
civilize Europe and reduce it to law and order, it is hard to imagine the
chaos that would have resulted when the Empire gave way to the barbarian
hordes which finally overwhelmed it. Where we should have been to-day in
the upward march of civilization, without the work of Rome, it is
impossible to say.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Contrast the Romans as a colonizing power with the modern Germans. The
English. The French.

2. At what period in our national development did home education with us
occupy substantially the same place as it did in Rome before 300 B.C.? In
what respects was the education given boys and girls similar? Different?

3. What was the most marked advance over the Greeks in the early Roman
training?

4. Contrast the education of the Athenian, Spartan, and Roman boy, during
the early period in each State.

5. To what extent does early Roman education indicate the importance of
the parent and of study of biography in the education of the young?

6. Was the change in character of the education of Roman youths, after the
expansion of the Roman State and the establishment of world contacts,
preventable, or was it a necessary evolution? Why? Have we ever
experienced similar changes?

CHAPTER IV

THE RISE AND CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY


I. THE RISE AND VICTORY OF CHRISTIANITY

RELIGIONS IN THE ROMAN WORLD. As was stated in the preceding chapter (p.
58), the Roman state religion was an outgrowth of the religion of the
home. Just as there had been a number of fireside deities, who were
supposed to preside over the different activities of the home, so there
were many state deities who were supposed to preside over the different
activities of the State. In addition, the Romans exhibited toward the
religions of all other peoples that same tolerance and willingness to
borrow which they exhibited in so many other matters. Certain Greek
deities were taken over and temples erected to them in Rome, and new
deities, to guard over such functions as health, fortune, peace, concord,
sowing, reaping, etc., were established. [1] Extreme tolerance also was
shown toward the special religions of other peoples who had been brought
within the Empire, and certain oriental divinities had even been admitted
and given their place in Rome.

Like many other features of Roman life, their religion was essentially of
a practical nature, dealing with the affairs of everyday life, and having
little or no relation to personal morality. [2] It promised no rewards or
punishments or hopes for a future life, but rather, by uniting all
citizens in a common reverence and fear of certain deities, helped to
unify the Empire and hold it together. After the death of Augustus (14
A.D.), the Roman Senate deified the Emperor and enrolled his name among
the gods, and Emperor worship was added to their ceremonies. This
naturally spread rapidly throughout the Empire, tended to unite all
classes in allegiance to the central government at Rome, and seemed to
form the basis for a universal religion for a universal empire.

FEELING THE NEED FOR SOMETHING MORE. As an educated class arose in Rome,
this mixture of diverse divinities failed to satisfy; the Roman religion,
made up as it was of state and parental duties and precautions, lost with
them its force; and the religious ceremonies of the home and the State
lost for them their meaning. The mechanical repetition of prayers and
sacrifices made no appeal to the emotions or to the moral nature of
individuals, and offered no spiritual joy or consolation as to a life
beyond. The educated Greeks before had had this same feeling, and had
indulged in much speculation as to the moral nature of man. Many educated
Romans now turned to the Greek philosophers for some more philosophical
explanation of the great mystery of life and death.

Of all the philosophies developed in the philosophical schools of Athens,
the one that made the deepest appeal to the practical Roman mind was that
of the Stoics, founded by Zeno, 308 B.C. Virtue, claimed the Stoics,
consists in so living that one's life is in accordance with that Universal
Reason which rules the world. Riches, position, fame, success--these count
for but little. He who trains himself to be above grief, hope, joy, fear,
and the ills of life--be he slave or peasant or king--may be happy because
he is virtuous. Reason, rather than the feelings, is the proper rule of
life. The Stoics also preached the brotherhood of man, and to a degree
expressed a humble reliance on a providence which controlled affairs. This
philosophy in a way met the need for a religion among the better-educated
Romans, and made considerable headway during the early days of the Empire.
[3] While serving as a sort of religion for those capable of embracing it,
it was too intellectual to reach more than a few, and was not adapted to
become a universal religion for all sorts and conditions of men. What was
needed was a new moral philosophy or religion that would touch all
mankind. To do this it must appeal to the emotions more than to the
intellect. Such a religion was at this time taking shape and gathering
force and strength in a remote corner of the Empire.

WHERE THIS NEW RELIGION AROSE. Far to the eastern end of the Mediterranean
there had long lived a branch of the Semitic race, which had developed a
national character and made a contribution of first importance to the
religious thought of the world. These were the Hebrew people who, leaving
Egypt about 1500 B.C., in the Exodus, had come to inhabit the land of
Canaan, south of Phoenicia and east and north of Egypt. From a wandering,
pastoral people they had gradually changed to a settled, agricultural
people, and had begun the development of a regular State. Unwilling,
however, to bear the burdens of a political State, and objecting to
taxation, a standing army, and forced labor for the State, the nationality
which promised at one time fell to pieces, and the land was overrun by
hostile neighbors and the people put under the yoke. After a sad and
tempestuous history, which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem by
the Romans in 70 A.D., the inhabitants were sold into slavery and
dispersed throughout the Roman Empire.

These people developed no great State, and made no contributions to
government or science or art. Their contribution was along religious
lines, and so magnificent and uplifting is their religious literature that
it is certain to last for all time. Alone among all eastern people they
early evolved the idea of one omnipotent God. The religion that they
developed declared man to be the child of God, erected personal morality
and service to God as the rule of life, and asserted a life beyond the
grave. It was about these ideas that the whole energy of the people
concentrated, and religion became the central thought of their lives. This
religion, unlike the other religions of the Mediterranean world,
emphasized duty to God, service, personal morality, chastity, honesty, and
truth as its essential elements. The Law of Moses became the law of the
land. Woman was elevated to a new place in the life of the ancient world.
[4] Children became sacred in the eyes of the people. Their literary
contribution, the Old Testament--written by a series of patriarchs,
lawgivers, prophets, and priests--pictures, often in sublime language, the
various migrations, deliverances, calamities, and religious hopes,
aspirations, and experiences of this Chosen People.

THE UNITY OF THIS PEOPLE. Just before their country was overrun and they
were carried captive to Babylon, in 588 B.C., the Pentateuch [5] had been
reduced to writing and made an authoritative code of laws for the people.
This served as a bond of union among them during the exile, and after
their return to Palestine, in 538 B.C., the study and observance of this
law became the most important duty of their lives. The synagogue was
established in every village for its exposition, where twice on every
Sabbath day the people were to gather to hear the law expounded. A race of
_Scribes_, or scripture scholars, also arose to teach the law, as well as
means for educating additional scribes. They were to interpret the law,
and to apply it to the daily lives of the people. As the law was a
combination of religious, ceremonial, civil, and sanitary law, these
scribes became both teachers and judges for the people. In time they
became the depositaries of all learning, superseded the priesthood, and
became the leaders (_rabbins_, whence _rabbi_) of the people. "The voice
of the rabbi is the voice of God," says the Talmud, a collection of Hebrew
customs and traditions, with comments and interpretations, written by the
rabbis after 70 B.C. By most Jews this is held to be next in sacredness to
the Old Testament (R. 27).

Realizing, after the return from captivity, that the future existence of
the Hebrew people would depend, not upon their military strength, but upon
their moral unity, and that this must be based upon the careful training
of each child in the traditions of his fathers, the leaders of the people
began the evolution of a religious school system to meet the national
need. Realizing, too, that parents could not be depended upon in all cases
to provide this instruction, the leaders provided it and made it
compulsory. Great open-air Bible classes were organized at first, and
these were gradually extended to all the villages of the country.
Elementary schools were developed later and attached to the synagogues,
and finally, in 64 A.D., the high priest, Joshua ben Gamala, ordered the
establishment of an elementary school in every village, made attendance
compulsory for all male children, and provided for a combined type of
religious and household instruction at home for all girls. Reading,
writing, counting, the history of the Chosen People, the poetry of the
Psalms, the Law of the Pentateuch, and a part of the Talmud constituted
the subject-matter of instruction. The instruction was largely oral, and
learning by heart was the common teaching plan. The child was taught the
Law of his fathers, trained to make holiness a rule of his life and to
subordinate his will to that of the one God, and commanded to revere his
teachers (R. 27) and uphold the traditions of his people.

After the destruction of Jerusalem (70 A.D.) and the scatterment of the
people, the school instruction was naturally more or less disrupted, but
in one way or another the Hebrew people have ever since managed to keep up
the training of rabbis and the instruction of the young in the Law and the
traditions of their people, and as a consequence of this instruction we
have to-day the interesting result of a homogeneous people who, for over
eighteen centuries, have had no national existence, and who have been
scattered and persecuted as have no other people. History offers us no
better example of the salvation of a people by means of the compulsory
education of all.

THE NEW CHRISTIAN FAITH. It was into this Hebrew race that Jesus was born,
[6] and there he lived, learned, taught, made his disciples, and was
crucified. Building on the old Hebrew moral law and the importance of the
personal life, Jesus made his appeal to the individual, and sought the
moral regeneration of society through the moral regeneration of individual
men and women. This idea of individuality and of personal souls worth
saving was a new idea in a world where the submergence of the individual
in the State had everywhere up to that time been the rule. Even the
Hebrews, in their great desire to perpetuate their race and faith, had
suppressed and absorbed the individual in their religious State. The
teachings of Jesus, on the other hand, with their emphasis on charity,
sympathy, self-sacrifice, and the brotherhood of all men, tended to
obliterate nationality, while the emphasis they gave to the future life,
for which life here was but a preparation, tended to subordinate the
interests of the State and withdraw the concern of men from worldly
affairs. In a series of simple sermons, Jesus set forth the basis of this
new faith which he, and after him his disciples, offered to the world.

At the time of his crucifixion his disciples numbered scarcely one hundred
persons. For some years after his death his disciples remained in
Jerusalem, preaching that he was the Messiah or Christ, whom the Hebrew
people had long expected, and making converts to the idea. Later in
Samaria, Damascus, and Antioch they made additional converts among the
Jews. Up to this point the Christians had been careful to keep up all the
old Jewish customs, and it was even doubted at first whether any but Jews
could properly be admitted to the new faith. A new convert, Saul of
Tarsus, a Jew who had studied in the Greek university there and who
afterwards became the Apostle Paul, did much to open the new faith to the
Gentiles, as the men of other nations were known. Speaking Greek, and
being versed in Greek philosophy, and especially Stoicism, he gave thirty
years of most effective service to the establishment of Christian churches
[7] in Asia Minor, Macedonia, Greece (R. 29), and Italy (R. 28). His work
was so important that he has often been called the second founder of the
Christian Church.

THE CHALLENGE OF CHRISTIANITY. Into a Roman world that had already passed
the zenith of its greatness came this new Christian faith, challenging
almost everything for which the Roman world had stood. In place of Roman
citizenship and service to the State as the purpose of life, the
Christians set up the importance of the life to come. Instead of pleasure
and happiness and the satisfaction of the senses as personal ends, the
Christians preached denial of all these things for the greater joy of a
future life. In a society built on a huge basis of slavery and filled with
social classes, the Christians proclaimed the equality of all men before
God. To a nation in which family life had become corrupt, infidelity and
divorce common, and infanticide a prevailing practice, the Christians
proclaimed the sacredness of the marriage tie and the family life, and the
exposure of infants as simple murder. In place of the subjection of the
individual to the State, the Christians demanded the subjection of the
individual only to God. In place of a union of State and religion, the
Christians demanded the complete separation of the two and the
subordination of the State to the Church. Unlike all other religions that
Rome had absorbed, the Christians refused to be accepted on any other than
exclusive terms. The worship of all other gods the Christians held to be
sinful idol-worship, a deadly sin in the eyes of God, and they were
willing to give up their lives rather than perform the simplest rite of
what they termed pagan worship (R. 28). To the deified Emperor the
Christians naturally could not bend the knee (Rs. 30 b, 31 a-b, 34).

At first the new faith attracted but little attention from anybody of
education or influence. Its converts were few during the first century,
and these largely from among the lowest social classes in the Empire.
Workmen and slaves, and women rather than men, constituted the large
majority of the early converts to the new faith. The character of its
missionaries [8] also was against it, and its challenge of almost all that
characterized the higher social and governmental life of Rome was certain
to make its progress difficult, and in time to awaken powerful opposition
[9] to it. Yet, notwithstanding all these obstacles, its progress was
relatively rapid.

THE VICTORY OF CHRISTIANITY. By the close of the first century there were
Christian churches throughout most of Judea and Asia Minor, and in parts
of Greece and Macedonia. During the second century other churches were
established in Asia Minor, in Greece, and along the Black Sea, and at a
few places in Italy and France; and before four centuries had elapsed from
the crucifixion Christian churches had been established throughout almost
all the Roman world. This is well shown by the map on the opposite page.

before that there was so much and so various Christian literature on the
subject."--_Christian Register._
MARTYRIA; a Legend, wherein are contained Homilies, Conversations, and
Incidents of the Reign of Edward the Sixth. Written by WILLIAM MOUNTFORD,
Clerk. With an Introduction to the American Edition, by Rev. F.D. HUNTINGTON.
16mo. pp. 348. Price, 75 cents.

"The charm of the book lies in the elevated tone of thought and moral
sentiment which pervades it. You feel, on closing the volume, as if
leaving some ancient cathedral, where your soul had been mingling with
ascending anthems and prayers. There is scarcely a page which does not
contain some fine strain of thought or sentiment, over which you shut the
book that you may pause and meditate.

"We recommend the volume to our readers, with the assurance that they will
find few works in the current literature of the day so well worth
perusal."--_Christian Register._
"This is really an original book. We have seen nothing for a long time more
fresh or true. The writer has succeeded wonderfully, in taking himself
and his readers into the heart of the age he describes. What is more,
he has uttered words and thoughts which stir up the deep places of
the soul. Let those read who wish to commune with the true and unpretending
martyr-spirit, the spread of faith and endurance, courage, self denial,
forgiveness, prayer.

"Of all the treatises we have ever read on marriage, we have seen none
so good as one here called a 'Marriage Sermon'; not that we would ask
any couple to hear it all on their marriage day, but we commend it to
all who are married, or intend to be. The whole book is precious."--_Providence
Journal._

"There are few religious books which breathe a finer spirit than this
singular volume. The author's mind seems to have meditated deeply on
the awful realities of life. In the thoughtful flow of his periods, and
the grave, earnest eloquence of particular passages, we are sometimes
reminded of the Old English prose writers. The work is a 'curiosity' of
literature, well worth an attentive perusal."--_Graham's Magazine._

A TRANSLATION OF PAUL'S EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS, with an Introduction and
Notes. By WILLIAM A. WHITWELL, Minister of the Congregational Society in
Wilton, N.H. 16mo. pp. 116. Price, 50 cents.

"We would express a high opinion of the book, and can assure the Christian
reader who will compare it carefully with our common version, that he will
rise up from the joint perusal of the two with a better understanding
of Paul than he had before."--_Christian Register._
CHRISTIANITY THE DELIVERANCE OF THE SOUL AND ITS LIFE. By WILLIAM
MOUNTFORD. With an Introduction by Rev. F.D. HUNTINGTON. 16mo. pp.

He brings religion home to the heart, and applies it as the guide of
the life."--_London Inquirer._
SELF-FORMATION; or the History of an Individual Mind: Intended as a
Guide for the Intellect through Difficulties to Success.

By a Fellow of a College. 12mo. pp. 504. Price, $1.00.

"The publishers have done good service by bringing forward an American
edition of this work. It may be most unreservedly recommended, especially
to the young."--_Daily Advertiser._
"Your gift of 'Self-Formation' is truly a welcome one, and I am greatly
obliged to you for it. It is a work of quite original character, and I
esteem it (in common with all I know of, who have read it) as possessed
of very rare merit. I am glad, for the cause of good education and
sound principle, that you have republished it, and I wish every young man
and woman in the community might be induced to read it carefully. It is
several years since I looked into it in the English edition,--but
I yet retain a vivid impression of the great delight it afforded me, and
I shall gladly avail of the opportunity of renewing it."--_Extract from a
Letter._
"This is emphatically a good book, which may be read with profit by all
classes, but more especially by young men, to whose wants it is admirably
adapted.

The American editor is no doubt right in saying, that it is almost without
a question the most valuable and useful work on self education that
has appeared in our own, if not in any other language."--_New York Tribune._

THOUGHTS ON MORAL AND SPIRITUAL CULTURE. By Rev. ROBERT C. WATERSTON.

Second Edition, revised. 16mo. pp. 302. Price, 62-1/2 cents.

This book has met with a ready sale in this country, and has been republished
in England.

A London periodical, in reviewing it, says:--"We will venture to
predict that it will soon take its place on the shelves of our religious
libraries, beside Ware 'On the Christian Character,' Greenwood's 'Lives
of the Apostles,' and other works to which we might refer as standard
publications, the value of which is not likely to be diminished by
the lapse of time or the caprices of fashion."
"The sense of duty in parents and teachers may be strengthened and elevated
by contemplating the high standard which is here held up to them.

    The style has the great merit of being an earnest one, and there are
    many passages which rise into genuine eloquence and the glow of
    poetry."--_N.A. Review._
    "The Lecture 'On the Best Means of exerting a Moral and Spiritual
    Influence in Schools,' no teacher, male or female, possessed of any
    of the germs of improvement, can read without benefit."--_Hon. Horace
    Mann, Secretary of the Board of Education._
    DOMESTIC WORSHIP. By WILLIAM H. FURNESS, Pastor of the First
    Congregational Unitarian Church in Philadelphia. Third Edition. 12mo.
    
    pp. 272. Price, 75 cents.
    

"We are glad to see this book. It is a work of great and peculiar excellence.
It is not a compilation from other books of devotion; nor is it made up
of conventional phrases and Scripture quotations, which have been so
long employed as the language of prayer, that they are repeated without
thought and without feeling. It is admirably adapted to the purpose
for which it was written; and it may be read again and again with great
interest and profit by any one, who desires to enrich his mind with
the purest sentiments of devotion, and with the language in which it finds
its best expression. Here we have the genuine utterances of religious
sensibility,--fresh, natural, and original, as they come from a
mind of singular fertility and beauty, and a heart overflowing with love
to God and love to man. They seem not like prayers made with hands, to
be printed in a book, but _real praying_, full of spirit and life.... So
remarkable is their tone of reality and genuineness, that we cannot
bring ourselves to regard them as compositions written for a purpose,
but rather as the actual utterances of a pure and elevated soul in
reverent and immediate communion with the Infinite Father."

--_Christian Examiner._

288. Price, 75 cents.

"It is simple and unpretending: and though some of the pieces are probably
familiar to most readers, they all breathe a pure and elevated spirit,
and here and there is an exquisite effusion of genius, which answers
to the holiest wants of the soul.

"Not only great pleasure may be derived from such a volume, but
lasting and useful impressions. Many are keenly alive to the harmony of
verse and the fresh outbursts of poetic feeling, who would pore with
delight over such a volume, and many might thus be won to high thought
and serious reflection."--_Christian Examiner._

THOUGHTS; selected from the Works
of WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING, D.D.

32mo. pp. 160. Price, 37-1/2 cents.

"This is a diamond of a volume, the purpose of which is well expressed in
the following 'thought' from Channing, which is put on the title-page:--

"'Sometimes a single word, spoken by the voice of genius, goes far into
the heart. A hint, a suggestion, an undefined delicacy of expression,
teaches more than we gather from volumes of less gifted men.'

"Those who differ in theological views from the gifted Channing will of
course find many thoughts in this little volume not to their taste.
But those to whom any theological views have ever done much good will
nevertheless prize the book for its thoughts. Thoughts they are, not
faint reflections of thought. And those who would be wise above all
things prize to know what can be thought on all sides of every important
subject. To enrich our columns we borrow a gem or two."--_Chronotype._
"A collection of noble thoughts, that may well take its place by the side
of the celebrated thoughts of Pascal, which have in them more of
metaphysics, but less that touches the human heart.

It makes a beautiful pocket volume."--_Christian Examiner._
"We have long desired to see a book of this kind, and now, from a slight
examination, believe that it is well done. It is a beautiful collection
of beautiful thoughts, and must be a welcome possession, not only for
all who agree with Dr. Channing in his peculiar religious opinions, but
for all who value lofty sentiments worthily expressed, and who by the
influence of such thoughts would be strengthened to duty, or raised to
a higher sphere of contemplation."--_Christian Register._
DAVID ELLINGTON. By Rev. HENRY WARE, JR. With other Extracts from his
Writings. 18mo. pp. 192. Price, 37-1/2 cents.

"Mr. Ware has left very few things which will do so much towards promoting
the great object for which he lived and labored. The simple story of the
every-day life of a good man, told as these stories are told, finds a
response in the hearts of those most indifferent to the great concerns
of virtue and religion; it reaches and touches what nothing else,
not the eloquent preaching of an apostle, could reach and touch."

CHRISTIAN CONSOLATIONS. Sermons designed to furnish Comfort and Strength
to the Afflicted. By Rev. A.P. PEABODY, Pastor of the South Church,
Portsmouth, N.H. 16mo. pp. 320. Price, 75 cents.

"We welcome with almost as much surprise as satisfaction the appearance
of a volume of discourses as excellent as those of Mr.
Peabody. They are rich in thought, and of a high order of literary
merit."--_N.A. Review._
THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD. By A.B. JACOCKS.
16mo. pp. 94. Price, 37-1/2 cents.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE: with an Outline of
some of its recent Developments among the Germans, embracing the Philosophical
Systems of Schelling and Hegel, and Oken's System of Nature. By J.B. STALLO,
A.M., lately Professor of Analytical Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and
Chemistry in St. John's College, N.Y. 12mo. pp. 532. Price, $1.25.

"It grapples with the most abstruse problems, and tugs fiercely to pluck
out the heart of their mystery. No difficulty is too great for the author
to meet, and none seems able to upset his theory. In truth, the book
is one of the most profound ever published in Boston, and whatever
opinion may be given regarding its principles, none can gainsay its
vigor of understanding and reach of learning.

The pertinent question, Who reads an American book? will change somewhat
its meaning, if American literature takes the abstruse direction
indicated by Mr. Stallo's volume. In that event, our books will remain
unread, not because they are too shallow, but because they are too
deep."--_Boston Courier._
MORNING AND EVENING MEDITATIONS, for every Day in a Month. By MISS CARPENTER
(daughter of the late Dr. Lant Carpenter). 16mo. pp. 312.
Price, 62-1/2 cents.

"The compiler of this work has rendered good service to all possessed of
Christian sympathies."--_Literary World._
"We like its spirit, and believe it will prove an excellent closet companion
for those who will faithfully use it."--_Christian Register._

THE WORDS OF CHRIST; from the New Testament. 16mo. pp. 150. Price, 50
cents.

"The compiler has most happily collected the words of Christ, so that, by
the slightest reference possible to the tables, every text is ascertained
under the several heads. It will prove very beneficial to the Biblical
scholar, clergyman, and Sunday-school teacher."--_Christian World._

"These topics Mr. Burnap treats with a freshness of thought which
will render the volume acceptable to those who have a taste for
reading of this sort, while its general merits place it in the class
of works one would wish to see extensively circulated among those
who think that Unitarianism has nothing to stand upon, or that it
is a doctrine full of impiety."--_Christian Examiner._

Although this book has been published but four years, it is now
used in _forty_ societies, and this fact is considered sufficient
to show the estimation in which it is held, and the manner in which
it has stood the test of comparison with other collections.
The following are some of the peculiar merits of the Christian
Hymns:--the number of hymns is very large; the variety of subjects
and metres is very great; the hymns are better adapted for singing;
the plan of arrangement is improved; and the price is very
low.

With a Preface by MRS. FOLLEN. 18mo. pp. 255.In time
Europe came to be dotted with thousands of these establishments, many of
which were large and expensive institutions both to found and to maintain.
[24] By the time the barbarian invasions were in full swing monasticism
had become an established institution of the Christian Church. Nunneries
for women also were established early. A letter from Saint Jerome to
Marcella, a Roman matron, in 382, in which he says that "no high-born lady
at Rome had made profession of the monastic life ... or had ventured ...
publicly to call herself a nun," would seem to imply that such
institutions had already been established in Rome.

MONASTIC SCHOOLS. Poverty, chastity, obedience, labor, and religious
devotion were the essential features of a monastic life. The Rule of Saint
Benedict (R. 43) organized in a practical way the efforts of those who
took the vows. In a series of seventy-three rules which he laid down,
covering all phases of monastic life, the most important from the
standpoint of posterity was the forty-eighth, prescribing at least seven
hours of daily labor and two hours of reading "for all able to bear the
load." From that part of the rule requiring regular manual labor the monks
became the most expert farmers and craftsmen of the early Middle Ages,
while to the requirement of daily reading we owe in large part the
development of the school and the preservation of learning in the West
during the long intellectual night of the mediaeval period (R. 44).

Into these monastic institutions the _oblati_, that is, those who wished
to become monks, were received as early as the age of twelve, and
occasionally earlier (R. 53 a). The final vows (R. 53 b) could not be
taken until eighteen, so during this period the novice was taught to work
and to read and write, given instruction in church music, and taught to
calculate the church festivals and to do simple reckoning. In time some
condensed and carefully edited compendium of the elements of classical
learning was also studied, and still later a more elaborate type of
instruction was developed in some of the monasteries. This, however,
belongs to a later division of this history, and further description of
church and monastic education will be deferred until we study the
intellectual life of the Middle Ages.

THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS. Aside from the general instruction in the
practices of the church and home instruction in the work of a woman, there
was but little provision made for the education of girls not desiring to
join a convent or nunnery. A few, however, obtained a limited amount of
intellectual training. The letter of Saint Jerome to the Roman lady Paula
(R. 45), regarding the education of her daughter, is a very important
document in the history of early Christian education for girls. Dating
from 403, it outlines the type of training a young girl should be given
who was to be properly educated in Christian faith and properly
consecrated to God. What he outlined was education for nunneries, a number
of which had been founded in the East and a few in the West. In the West
these institutions later experienced an extensive development, and offered
the chief opportunity for any intellectual education for women during the
whole of the Middle Ages.


III. WHAT THE MIDDLE AGES STARTED WITH

WHAT THE CHURCH BROUGHT TO THE MIDDLE AGES. From a small and purely
spiritual organization, devoting its energies to exhortation and to the
moral regeneration of mankind, and without creed or form of government, as
the Christian Church was in the first two centuries of its development, we
have traced the organization of a body of doctrine, the perfection of a
strong system of church government, and the development of a very limited
educational system designed merely to train leaders for its service. We
have also shown how it added to its early ecclesiastical organization a
strong governmental organization, became a State within a State, and
gradually came to direct the State itself. It was thus ready, when the
virtual separation of the Roman Empire into an eastern and western
division took place, in 395, and when the western division finally fell
before the barbarian onslaughts, to take up in a way the work of the
State, force the barbarian hordes to acknowledge its power, and begin the
process of civilizing these new tribes and building up once more a
civilization in the western world. In addition to its spiritual and
political power, the Church also had developed, in its catechumenal
instruction and in the cathedral and monastic schools, a very meager form
of an educational system for the training of its future leaders and
servants. A great change had now taken place in the nature of education as
a preparation for life, and intellectual education, in the sense that it
was known and understood in Greece and Rome, was not to be known again in
the western world for almost a thousand years. The distinguishing
characteristic of the centuries which follow, up to the Revival of
Learning, are, first, a struggle against very adverse odds to prevent
civilization from disappearing entirely, and later a struggle to build up
new foundations upon which world civilization might begin once more where
it had left off in Greece and Rome.

THE THREE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD. Thus, before the
Middle Ages began, the three great contributions of the ancient world
which were to form the foundations of our future western civilization had
been made. Greece gave the world an art and a philosophy and a literature
of great charm and beauty, the most advanced intellectual and aesthetic
ideas that civilization has inherited, and developed an educational system
of wonderful effectiveness--one that in its higher development in time
took captive the entire Mediterranean world and profoundly modified all
later thinking. Rome was the organizing and legal genius of the ancient
world, as Greece was the literary and philosophical. To Rome we are
especially indebted for out conceptions of law, order, and government, and
for the ability to make practical and carry into effect the ideals of
other peoples. To the Hebrews we are indebted for the world's loftiest
conceptions of God, religious faith, and moral responsibility, and to
Christianity and the Church we are indebted for making these ideas
universal in the Roman Empire and forcing them on a barbaric world.

All these great foundations of our western civilization have not come down
to us directly. The hostility to pagan learning that developed on the part
of the Latin Fathers; the establishment of an eastern capital for the
Empire at Constantinople, in 328; the virtual division of the Empire into
an East and West, in 395; and the final division of the Christian Church
into a Western Latin and an Eastern Greek Church, which was gradually
effected, finally drove Greek philosophy and learning and the Greek
language from the western world. Greek was not to be known again in the
West for hundreds of years. Fortunately the Eastern Church was more
tolerant of pagan learning than was the Western, and was better able to
withstand conquest by barbarian tribes. In consequence what the Greeks had
done was preserved at Constantinople until Europe had once more become
sufficiently civilized and tolerant to understand and appreciate it.
Hellenic learning was then handed back to western Europe, first through
the medium of the Saracens, and then in that great Revival of Learning
which we know as the _Renaissance_. Of the Latin literature and learning
much was lost, and much was preserved almost by accident in the
monasteries of mediaeval Europe. Even the Church itself was seriously
deflected from its earlier purpose and teachings during the long period of
barbarism and general ignorance through which it passed, and only in
modern times has it tried to come back to the spirit of the teachings of
its founder.

[Illustration: FIG. 30. SHOWING THE FINAL DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE AND THE
CHURCH

The map also shows conditions as they were in Europe at the end of the
fourth century A.D. Syria, Egypt, Africa, and a portion of Asia Minor were
overwhelmed by the Saracens in the seventh century and became Mohammedan,
but Constantinople held out until 1453. The eastern division eventually
gave rise to the Greek Catholic Church of Greece, the Balkans, and Russia,
while the western division became the Roman Catholic Church of western
Europe. At Constantinople Greek learning was preserved until the West was
again ready to receive it. The Eastern Empire for a time retained control
of Sicily and southern Italy (the old _Magna Graecia_), but eventually
these were absorbed by western or Latin Christianity.]

THE FUTURE STORY. For the long period of intellectual stagnation which now
followed, the educational story is briefly told. But little formal
education was needed, and that of but one main type. It was only after the
Church had won its victory over the barbarian hordes, and had built up the
foundations upon which a new civilization could be developed, that
education in any broad and liberal sense was again needed. This required
nearly a thousand years of laborious and painful effort. Then, when
schools again became possible and learning again began to be demanded,
education had to begin again with the few at the top, and the
contributions of Greece and Rome had to be recovered and put into usable
form as a basis upon which to build. It is only very recently that it has
become possible to extend education to all.

In Part II we shall next trace briefly the intellectual life of the Middle
Ages, and the reawakening, and in Part III we shall, among other things,
point out the deep and lasting influence of the work of these ancient
civilizations on our modern educational thoughts and practices.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Point out the many advantages of a universal religion for such a
universal Empire as Rome developed, and the advantages of Emperor worship
for such an Empire.

2. What do modern nations have that is much akin to Emperor worship?

3. Explain why Stoicism made such an appeal to the better-educated classes
at Rome.

4. Why is an emotional faith better adapted to the mass of people than an
intellectual one?

5. Explain how the Hebrew scribes, administering such a mixed body of
laws, naturally came to be both teachers and judges for the people.

6. Illustrate how the Hebrew tradition that the moral and spiritual unity
of a people is stronger than armed force has been shown to be true in
history.

7. What great lessons may we draw from the work of the Hebrews in
maintaining a national unity through compulsory education?

8. Why was Jesus' idea as to the importance of the individual destined to
make such slow headway in the world? What is the status of the idea to-day
(a) in China? (b) in Germany? (c) in England? (d) in the United States? Is
the idea necessarily opposed to nationality or even to a strong state
government?

9. Show how the political Church, itself the State, was the natural
outcome during the Middle Ages of the teachings of the early Christians as
to the relationship of Church and State.

10. Is it to be wondered that the Romans were finally led to persecute
"the vast organized defiance of law by the Christians"?

11. Show how the Christian idea of the equality and responsibility of all
gave the citizen a new place in the State.

12. State the reasons for the gradually increasing lack of sympathy and
understanding between the eastern and western Fathers of the Church, and
which finally led to the division of the Church.

13. Explain what is meant by "a State within a State" as applied to the
Church of the third and fourth centuries. Did this prove to be a good
thing for the future of civilization? Why?

14. Would Rome probably have been better able to withstand the barbarian

15. Show how the Christian attitude toward pagan learning tended to stop
schools and destroy the accumulated learning.

16. What was the effect of the Christian attitude toward the care of the
body, on scientific and medical knowledge, and on education? Was the
Christian or the pagan attitude more nearly like that of modern times?

17. Why did the emphasis on form of belief, in the third and fourth
centuries, come to supersede the emphasis on personal virtues and simple
faith of the first and second centuries?

18. Compare the work of the Sunday School of to-day with the catechumenal
instruction of the early Christians.

THE MEDIAEVAL WORLD

THE DELUGE OF BARBARISM
THE MEDIAEVAL STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE AND REËSTABLISH CIVILIZATION


CHAPTER V

NEW PEOPLES IN THE EMPIRE


THE WEAKENED EMPIRE. Though the first and second centuries A.D. have often
been called one of the happiest ages in all human history, due to a
succession of good Emperors and peace and quiet throughout the Roman
world, [1] the reign of the last of the good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius
(161-180 A.D.), may be regarded as clearly marking a turning-point in the
history of Roman society. Before his reign Rome was ascendant, prosperous,
powerful; during his reign the Empire was beset by many difficulties--
pestilence, floods, famine, troubles with the Christians, and heavy German
inroads--to which it had not before been accustomed; and after his reign
the Empire was distinctly on the defensive and the decline. Though the
elements contributing to this change in national destiny had their origin
in the changes in the character of the national life at least two
centuries earlier, it was not until now that the Empire began to feel
seriously the effects of these changes in a lowered vitality and a
weakened power of resistance.

The virtues of the citizens of the early days of the Republic, trained
according to the old ideas, had gradually given way in the face of the
vices and corruption which beset and sapped the life of the upper and
ruling classes in the later Empire. The failure of Rome to put its
provincial government on any honest and efficient civil-service basis, the
failure of the State to establish and direct an educational system capable
of serving as a corrective of dangerous national tendencies, the lack of a
guiding national faith, the gradual admission of so many Germans into the
Empire, the great extent and demoralizing influence of slavery [2]--all
contributed to that loss of national strength and resisting power which
was now becoming increasingly evident. Other contributing elements of
importance were the almost complete obliteration of the peasantry by the
creation of great landed estates and cattle ranches worked by slaves, in
place of the small farms of earlier days; the increase of the poor in the
cities, and the declining birth-rate; the introduction of large numbers of
barbarians as farmers and soldiers; and the demoralization of the city
rabble by political leaders in need of votes. Captured slaves performed
almost every service, and a lavish display of wealth on the part of a few
came to be a characteristic feature of city life. [3] The great middle,
commercial, and professional classes were still prosperous and contented,
but luxury, imported vices, slavery, political corruption, and new ideals
[4] had gradually sapped the old national vitality and destroyed the
resisting power of the State in the face of a great national calamity.
Rome now stood, much like the shell of a fine old tree, apparently in good
condition, but in reality ready to fall before the blast because it had
been allowed to become rotten at the heart. Sooner or later the boundaries
of the Empire, which had held against the pressure from without for so
long, were destined to be broken and the barbarian deluge from the north
and east would pour over the Empire.

[Illustration: FIG. 31. A BODYGUARD OF GERMANS

his victories over the Marcomanni, and other German tribes.]

THE BOUNDARIES OF THE EMPIRE ARE BROKEN. While temporary extensions of
territory had at times been made beyond the Rhine and the Danube, these
rivers had finally come to be the established boundaries of the Empire on
the north, and behind these rivers the Teutonic barbarians, or _Germani_,
as the Romans called them, had by force been kept. To do even this the
Romans had been obliged to admit bands of Germans into the Empire, and had
taken them into the Roman army as "allies," making use of their great love
for fighting to hold other German tribes in check. In 166 A.D. the plague,
brought back by soldiers returning from the East, carried off
approximately half the population of Italy. This same year the Marcomanni
(see Figure 18), a former friendly tribe, invaded the Empire as far as the
head of the Adriatic Sea, and it required thirteen years of warfare to put
them back behind the Danube. Even this was accomplished only by the aid of
friendly German tribes. From this time on the Empire was more or less on
the defensive, with the barbarian tribes to the north casting increasingly
longing eyes toward "a place in the sun" and the rich plunder that lay to
the south, and frequently breaking over the boundaries. Rome, though, was
still strong enough to put them back again.

In 275 A.D., after a five years' struggle, the Eastern Emperor gave the
province of Dacia, to the south of the Danube, to the Visigoths, in an
effort to buy them off from further invasion and warfare. This eased the
pressure for another century. In 378 A.D., now pressed on by the terrible
Huns from behind, the Visigoths, as a body, invaded the Eastern Empire,
and in the Battle of Adrianople, near Constantinople, defeated the Roman
army, slew the Roman Emperor, definitely broke the boundaries of the
Empire, and they and the Ostrogoths now moved southward and settled in
Moesia and Thrace. The Germans at Adrianople learned that they could beat
the Roman legions, and from this time on it was they, and not the Romans,
who named the terms of ransom and the price of peace. A few years later,
under Alaric, the Visigoths invaded Greece, then turned westward through
Illyria to the valley of the Po, in northern Italy, which they reached in
the year 400. In 410 the great calamity came when they captured and sacked
Rome. The effect produced on the Roman world by the fall of the Eternal
City, as the news of the almost incredible disaster penetrated to the
remote provinces, was profound (R. 48). For eight hundred years Rome had
not been touched by foreign hands, and now it had been captured and
plundered by barbarian hordes. It seemed to many as though the end of the
world were approaching. The Visigoths now turned west once more, carrying
with them the beautiful sister of the Emperor as a captive bride of the
chief, and finally settled in Spain and southern Gaul, which provinces
were thenceforth lost to Rome. This was the first of the great permanent
inroads into the Empire, and from now on Roman resistance seemed powerless
to stop the flood.

down. Take a pencil and trace the route followed by each of these
peoples.]

A PERIOD OF TRIBAL MOVEMENTS. The Hunnish pressure also started the
Vandals and Suevi, and within fifty years they had been able to move
across Germany, France, and Spain, plundering the cities on their way.
Finally they crossed to the northern coast of Africa, where they became
noted as the great sea pirates of the Mediterranean. In 455 they crossed
back to Italy, and Rome was sacked for the second time by barbarian
hordes. The Huns, under the leadership of Attila, the so-called "Scourge
of God," now moved in and ravaged Gaul (451) and northern Italy (452), and
then, at the intercession of the Roman Pope Leo, were induced by a ransom
price to return to the lower Danube, where they have since remained. In
476 the barbarian soldiers of the Empire, tired of camp life and demanding
land on which they too might settle, rose in revolt, displaced the last of
the Western Emperors, and elevated Odovacar, a tribesman from the north,
as ruler in his stead. The Western Roman Empire was now at an end. In 493
Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, became king of Italy.

Between 443 and 485 the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes left their earlier homes
in what is now Denmark and northwestern Germany, and overran eastern and
southern Britain. In 486 the Franks, a great nation living along the lower
Rhine, began to move, and within two generations had overrun almost all of
Gaul. In 586 the Lombards invaded and settled the valleys of northern
Italy, displacing the Ostrogoths there. Slavic tribes now moved into the
Eastern Empire--Serbs and Bulgars--and settled in Moesia and Thrace.
Southeastern Europe thus became Slavic-Greek, as western Europe had become
Teutonic-Latin. Figure 32 shows the results of these different migrations
up to about 500 A.D.

EUROPE TO BE TEUTONIC-LATIN. In the seventh century another great wave of
people, of a different racial stock and religion--Semitic and Mohammedan--
starting from Arabia and along the shores of the Red Sea, swept rapidly
through Egypt and Africa and across into Spain and France. For a time it
looked as though they might overrun all western Europe and bring the
German tribes under subjection. Fortunately they were definitely stopped
and decisively defeated by the Franks, in the great Battle of Tours, in
732. They also overran Syria and Persia, but were held in check in Asia
Minor by the Eastern Empire, which did not completely succumb to barbarian
inroads until Constantinople was taken by the Turks, in 1453.

The importance of the result, to the future of our western civilization,
of this battle in the West can hardly be overestimated. The future of
European government, law, education, and civilization was settled on that
Saturday afternoon in October, on the battle plains of Tours. [5] It was a
struggle for mastery and dominion between the Aryan and Semitic races,
between the Christian and Mohammedan religions, between the forces
representing order on the one side and destruction on the other, and
between races destined to succeed to the civilization of Greece and Rome
and a race representing oriental despotism and static conditions.

[Illustration: FIG. 33. THE KNOWN WORLD IN 800
This map shows the great extent of the Mohammedan conquests. The part
marked as "European Heathen" was added to Christianity within the next few
centuries, and became a part of our Latin-Teutonic or western
civilization.]

Driven back across the Pyrenees by the Franks, these people settled in
Spain; later developed there, for a short period, a for-the-time
remarkable civilization, but one that only slightly influenced the current
of European development; and then disappeared as a force in our western
development and progress. We shall meet them again a little later, but
only for a little while, and then they concern our western development no
more.

Our interest from now on lies with the Teutonic-Latin peoples of western
Europe, for it is through them that our western civilization has been
worked out and has come down to us.

WHO THESE INVADERS WERE. A long-continued series of tribal migrations,
unsurpassed before in history, had brought a large number of new peoples
within the boundaries of the old Empire. They finally came so fast that
they could not have been assimilated even in the best days of Rome, and
now the assimilative and digestive powers of Rome were gone. Tall, huge of
limb, white-skinned, flaxen-haired, with fierce blue eyes, and clad in
skins and rude cloths, they seemed like giants to the short, small, dark-
skinned people of the Italian peninsula. Quarrelsome; delighting in
fighting and gambling; given to drunkenness and gluttonous eating;
possessed of a rude polytheistic religion in which _Woden_, the war god,
held the first place, and Valhalla was a heaven for those killed in
battle; living in rude villages in the forest, and maintaining themselves
by hunting and fishing--it is not to be wondered that Rome dreaded the
coming of these forest barbarians (R. 46).

[Illustration: FIG 34. A GERMAN WAR CHIEF
Restored, and rather idealized (From the Musée d'Artillerie at Paris)]

The tribes nearest the Rhine and the Danube had taken on a little
civilization from long contact with the Romans, but those farther away
were savage and unorganized (Rs. 46, 47). In general they represented a
degree of civilization not particularly different from that of the better
American Indians in our colonial period, [6] though possessing a much
larger ability to learn. The "two terrible centuries" which brought these
new peoples into the Empire were marked by unspeakable disorder and
frightful destruction. It was the most complete catastrophe that had ever
befallen civilized society.

[Illustration: FIG. 35. ROMANS DESTROYING A GERMAN VILLAGE
(From the Column of Marcus Aurelius, at Rome) Note the circular huts of
reeds, without windows, and with but a single door.]

THEY SETTLE DOWN WITHIN THE EMPIRE. Finally, after a period of wandering
and plundering, each of these new peoples settled down within the Empire
as rulers over the numerically larger native Roman population, and slowly
began to turn from hunting to a rude type of farming. For three or four
centuries after the invasions ceased, though, Europe presented a dreary
spectacle of ignorance, lawlessness, and violence. Force reigned where law
and order had once been supreme. Work largely ceased, because there was no
security for the results of labor. The Roman schools gradually died out,
in part because of pagan hostility (all pagan schools were closed by
imperial edict in 529 A.D.), and in part because they no longer ministered
to any real need. The church and the monastery schools alone remained, the
instruction in these was meager indeed, and they served almost entirely
the special needs of the priestly and monastic classes. The Latin language
was corrupted and modified into spoken dialects, and the written language
died out except with the monks and the clergy. Even here it became greatly
corrupted. Art perished, and science disappeared. The former Roman skill
in handicrafts was largely lost. Roads and bridges were left without
repair. Commerce and intercourse almost ceased. The cities decayed, and
many were entirely destroyed (R. 49).

The new ruling class was ignorant--few could read or write their names--
and they cared little for the learning of Greece and Rome. Much of what
was excellent in the ancient civilizations died out because these new
peoples were as yet too ignorant to understand or use it, and what was
preserved was due to the work of others than themselves. It was with such
people and on such a basis that it was necessary for whatever constructive
forces still remained to begin again the task of building up new
foundations for a future European civilization. This was the work of
centuries, and during the period the lamp of learning almost went out.

BARBARIAN AND ROMAN IN CONTACT. Civilization was saved from almost
complete destruction chiefly by reason of the long and substantial work
which Rome had done in organizing and governing and unifying the Empire;
by the relatively slow and gradual coming of the different tribes; and by
the thorough organization of the governing side of the Christian Church,
which had been effected before the Empire was finally overrun and Roman
government ceased. In unifying the government of the Empire and
establishing a common law, language, and traditions, and in early
beginning the process of receiving barbarians into the Empire and
educating them in her ways and her schools, [7] Rome rendered the western
world a service of inestimable importance and one which did much to
prepare the way for the reception and assimilation of the invaders. [8] In
the cities, which remained Roman in spirit even after their rulers had
changed, and where the Roman population greatly preponderated even after
the invaders had come, some of the old culture and handicrafts were kept
up, and in the cities of southern Europe the municipal form of city
government was retained. Roman law still applied to trials of Roman
citizens, and many Roman governmental forms passed over to the invader
chiefly because he knew no other. The old Roman population for long
continued to furnish the clergy, and these, because of their ability to
read and write, also became the secretaries and advisers of their rude
Teutonic overlords. In one capacity or another they persuaded the leaders
of the tribes to adopt, not only Christianity, but many of the customs and
practices of the old civilization as well. These various influences helped
to assimilate and educate the newcomers, and to save something of the old
civilization for the future. Being strong, sturdy, and full of youthful
energy, and with a large capacity for learning, the civilizing process,
though long and difficult, was easier than it might otherwise have been,
and because of their strength and vigor these new races in time infused
new life and energy into every land from Spain to eastern Europe (R. 50).

The most powerful force with which the barbarians came in contact, though,
and the one which did most to reduce them to civilization, was the
Christian Church. Organized, as we have seen, after the Roman governmental
model, and as a State within a State, the Church gained in strength as the
Roman government grew weaker, and was ready to assume governmental
authority when Rome could no longer exert it. The barbarians here
encountered an organization stronger than force and greater than kings,
[9] which they must either accept and make terms with or absolutely
destroy. As all the tribes, though heathen, possessed some form of spirit
or nature worship or heathen gods, which served as a basis for
understanding the appeal of the Church, the result was the ultimate
victory, and the Christianizing, in name at least, of all the barbarian
tribes. This was the first step in the long process of civilizing and
educating them.

THE IMPRESS OF CHRISTIANITY UPON THEM. The importance of the services
rendered by bishops, priests, and monks during what are known as the _Dark
Ages_ can hardly be overestimated. In the face of might they upheld the
right of the Church and its representatives to command obedience and
respect. [10] The Christian priest gradually forced the barbarian chief to
do his will, though at times he refused to be awed into submission,
murdered the priest, and sacked the sacred edifice. That the Church lost
much of its early purity of worship, and adopted many practices fitted to
the needs of the time, but not consistent with real religion, there can be
no question. In time the Church gained much from the mixture of these new
peoples among the old, as they infused new vigor and energy into the blood
of the old races, but the immediate effect was quite otherwise. The Church
itself was paganized, but the barbarians were in time Christianized.

Priests and missionaries went among the heathen tribes and labored for
their conversion. Of course the leaders were sought out first, and often
the conversion of a chieftain was made by first converting his wife. After
the chieftain had been won the minor leaders in time followed. The lesson
of the cross was proclaimed, and the softening and restraining influences
of the Christian faith were exerted on the barbarian. It was, however, a
long and weary road to restore even a semblance of the order and respect
for life and property which had prevailed under Roman rule.

One of the most interesting of all the conversions was that made by the
Bishop Ulphilas (c. 313-383) among the Visigoths, before they moved
westward from their original home north of the Danube, in what is now
southwestern Russia. Ulphilas was made bishop and sent among them in 343,
and spent the remainder of his life in laboring with them. He devised an
alphabet for them, based on the Greek, and gave them a written language
into which he translated for them the Bible, or rather large portions of
it. In the translation he omitted the two books of Kings and the two
Samuels, that the people might not find in them a further stimulus to
their great warlike activity.

[Illustration: FIG. 36. A PAGE OF THE GOTHIC GOSPELS (_reduced_)
One of the treasures of the library of the University or Upsala, in
Sweden, is a manuscript of this translation by Bishop Ulphilas. Greek
letters, with a few Runic signs were used to represent Gothic sounds. The
word "rune" comes from a Gothic word meaning "mystery." To the primitive
Germans it seemed a mysterious thing that a series of marks could express
thought.]

Christianity had been carried early to Great Britain by Roman
missionaries, and in 440 Saint Patrick converted the Irish. In 563 Saint
Columba crossed to Scotland, founded the monastery at Iona, and began the
conversion of the Scots. After the Angles and Saxons and Jutes had overrun
eastern and southern Britain there was a period of several generations
during which this portion of the island was given over to Teutonic
heathenism. In 597 Saint Augustine, "the Apostle to the English," landed
in Kent and began the conversion of the people, that year succeeding in
converting Ethelbert, King of Kent. In 626 Edwin, King of Northumbria, was
converted, and in 635 the English of Wessex accepted Christianity. The
English at once became strong supporters of the Christian faith, and in
878 they forced the invading Danes to accept Christianity as one of the
conditions of the Peace of Wedmore. (See Map, Figure 42.)

In 496 Clovis, King of the Franks, and three thousand of his followers
were baptized, following a vow and a victory in battle; [11] in 587
Recarred, King of the Goths in Spain, was won over; and in 681 the South
Saxons accepted Christianity. The Germans of Bavaria and Thuringia were
finally won over by about 740. Charlemagne repeatedly forced the northern
Saxons to accept Christianity, between 772 and 804, when the final
submission of this German tribe took place. Finally, in the tenth century,
Rollo, Duke of the Normans, was won (912); Boleslav II, King of the
Bohemians, in 967; and the Hungarians in 972. In the tenth century the
Slavs were converted to the Eastern or Greek type of Christianity, and
Poland, Norway, and Sweden to the Western or Roman type. The last people
to be converted were the Prussians, a half-Slavic tribe inhabiting East
Prussia and Lithuania, along the eastern Baltic, who were not brought to
accept Christianity, in name, until near the middle of the thirteenth
century, though efforts were begun with them as early as 900. As late as
1230 they were still offering human sacrifices to their heathen gods to
secure their favor, but soon after this date they were forced to a nominal
acceptance of Christianity as a result of conquest by the "Teutonic
Knights." It was thus a thousand years after its foundation before Europe
had accepted in name the Christian faith. To change a nominal acceptance
to some semblance of a reality has been the work of the succeeding
centuries.

WORK OF THE CHURCH DURING THE MIDDLE AGES. Everywhere throughout the old
Empire, and far into the forest depths of barbarian lands, went bishops,
priests, and missionaries, and there parishes were organized, rude
churches arose, and the process of educating the fighting tribesmen in the
ways of civilized life was carried out. It was not by schools of learning,
but by faith and ceremonial that the Church educated and guided her
children into the type she approved. Schools for other than monks and
clergy for a time were not needed, and such practically died out. The
Church and its offices took the place of education and exercised a
wholesome and restraining influence over both young and old throughout the
long period of the Middle Ages. These the Church in time taught the
barbarian to respect. The great educational work of the Church during this
period of insecurity and ignorance has seldom been better stated than in
the following words by Draper:

    Of the great ecclesiastics, many had risen from the humblest ranks
    of society, and these men, true to their democratic instincts, were
    often found to be the inflexible supporters of right against might.
    Eventually coming to be the depositaries of the knowledge that then
    existed, they opposed intellect to brute force, in many instances
    successfully, and by the example of the organization of the Church,
    which was essentially republican, they showed how representative
    systems may be introduced into the State. Nor was it over communities
    and nations that the Church displayed her chief power. Never in the
    world before was there such a system. From her central seat at Rome,
    her all-seeing eye, like that of Providence itself, could equally take
    in a hemisphere at a glance, or examine the private life of any
    individual. Her boundless influences enveloped kings in their palaces,
    and relieved the beggar at the monastery gate. In all Europe there was
    not a man too obscure, too insignificant, or too desolate for her.
    Surrounded by her solemnities, every one received his name at her
    altar; her bells chimed at his marriage, her knell tolled at his
    funeral. She extorted from him the secrets of his life at her
    confessionals, and punished his faults by her penances. In his hour of
    sickness and trouble her servants sought him out, teaching him, by her
    exquisite litanies and prayers, to place his reliance on God, or
    strengthening him for the trials of life by the example of the holy
    and just. Her prayers had an efficacy to give repose to the souls of
    his dead. When, even to his friends, his lifeless body had become an
    offense, in the name of God she received it into her consecrated
    ground, and under her shadow he rested till the great reckoning-day.
    From little better than a slave she raised his wife to be his equal,
    and, forbidding him to have more than one, met her recompense for
    those noble deeds in a firm friend at every fireside. Discountenancing
    all impure love, she put round that fireside the children of one
    mother, and made that mother little less than sacred in their eyes. In
    ages of lawlessness and rapine, among people but a step above savages,
    she vindicated the inviolability of her precincts against the hand of
    power, and made her temples a refuge and sanctuary for the despairing
    and oppressed. Truly she was the shadow of a great rock in many a
    weary land. [12.]

THE CIVILIZING WORK OF THE MONASTERIES. No less important than the Church
and its clergy was the work of the monasteries and their monks in building
up a basis for a new civilization. These, too, were founded all over
Europe. To make a map of western Europe showing the monasteries
established by 800 A.D. would be to cover the map with a series of dots.
[13] The importance of their work is better understood when we remember
that the Germans had never lived in cities, and did not settle in them on
entering the Empire. The monasteries, too, were seldom established in
towns. Their sites were in the river valleys and in the forests (R. 69),
and the monks became the pioneers in clearing the land and preparing the
way for agriculture and civilization. Not infrequently a swamp was taken
and drained. The Middle-Age period was essentially a period of settlement
of the land and of agricultural development, and the monks lived on the
land and among a people just passing through the earliest stages of
settled and civilized life. In a way the inheritors of the agricultural
and handicraft knowledge of the Romans, the monks became the most skillful
artisans and farmers to be found, and from them these arts in time reached
the developing peasantry around them. Their work and services have been
well summed up by the same author just quoted, as follows:

    It was mainly by the monasteries that to the peasant class of Europe
    was pointed out the way of civilization. The devotions and charities;
    the austerities of the brethren; their abstemious meal; their meager
    clothing, the cheapest of the country in which they lived; their
    shaven heads, or the cowl which shut out the sight of sinful objects;
    the long staff in their hands; their naked feet and legs; their
    passing forth on their journeys by twos, each a watch on his brother;
    the prohibitions against eating outside of the wall of the monastery,
    which had its own mill, its own bakehouse, and whatever was needed in
    an abstemious domestic economy (Figure 38); their silent hospitality
    to the wayfarer, who was refreshed in a separate apartment; the lands
    around their buildings turned from a wilderness into a garden, and,
    above all, labor exalted and ennobled by their holy hands, and
    celibacy, forever, in the eye of the vulgar, a proof of separation
    from the world and a sacrifice to heaven--these were the things that
    arrested the attention of the barbarians of Europe, and led them on to
    civilization. [14]

THE PROBLEM FACED BY THE MIDDLE AGES. That the lamp of learning burned low
during this period of assimilation is no cause for wonder. Recovery from
such a deluge of barbarism on a weakened society is not easy. In fact the
recovery was a long and slow process, occupying nearly the whole of a
thousand years. The problem which faced the Church, as the sole surviving
force capable of exerting any constructive influence, was that of changing
the barbarism and anarchy of the sixth century, with its low standards of
living and lack of humane ideals, into the intelligent, progressive
civilization of the fifteenth century. This was the work of the Middle
Ages, and largely the work of the Christian Church. It was not a period of
progress, but one of assimilation, so that a common western civilization
might in time be developed out of the diverse and hostile elements mixed
together by the rude force of circumstances. The enfeebled Roman race was
to be reinvigorated by mixture with the youthful and vigorous Germans (R.
50); to the institutions of ancient society were to be added certain
social and political institutions of the Germanic peoples; all were to be
brought under the rule of a common Christian Church; and finally, when
these people had become sufficiently civilized and educated to enable them
to understand and appreciate, "nearly every achievement of the Greeks and
the Romans in thought, science, law, and the practical arts" was to be
recovered and made a part of our western civilization.

In this chapter we have dealt largely with the great fundamental movements
which have so deeply influenced the course of human history. In the
chapters which immediately follow we shall tell how learning was preserved
during the period and what facilities for education actually existed;
trace the more important efforts made to reëstablish schools and learning;
and finally describe the culmination of the process of absorbing and
educating the Germans in the civilization they had conquered that came in
the great period of recovery of the ancient learning and civilization--the
age of the Renaissance.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Do the peculiar problems of assimilation of the foreign-born, revealed
to us by the World War, put us in a somewhat similar position to Rome
under the Empire as relates to the need of a guiding national faith?

2. Outline how Rome might have been helped and strengthened by a national
school system under state control.

3. Outline how our state school systems could be made much more effective
as national instruments by the infusion into their instruction of a strong
national faith.

4. Try to picture the results upon our civilization had western Europe
become Mohammedan.

5. The movement of new peoples into the Roman Empire was much slower than
has been the immigration of foreign peoples into the United States, since
1840. Why the difference in assimilative power?

6. How do you think the Roman provinces and Italy, after the tribes from
the North had settled down within the Empire, compared with Mexico after
the years of revolution with peons and brigands in control? With Russia,
after the destruction wrought by the Bolshevists?

7. Explain the importance of the long civilizing and educating work of
Rome among the German tribes, in preparing the means for the preservation
of Roman institutions after the downfall of the Roman government.

8. What does the fact that Roman institutions and Roman thinking continued
and profoundly modified mediaeval life indicate as to the nature of Roman
government and the Roman power of assimilation?

9. Though Rome never instituted a state school system, was there not after
all large educational work done by the government through its intelligent
administration?

10. Show how the breakdown of Roman government and Roman institutions was
naturally more complete in Gaul than in northern Italy, and more complete
in northern than in central or southern Italy, and hence how Roman
civilization was naturally preserved in larger measure in the cities of
Italy than elsewhere.

11. Show how the Christian Church, too, could not have completely
dispensed with Roman letters and Roman civilization, had it desired to do
so, but was forced of necessity to preserve and pass on important portions
of the civilization of Rome.

12. What do you think would have been the effect on the future of
civilization had the barbarian tribes overrun Spain, Italy, and Greece
during the Age of Pericles?

13. What modern analogies do we have to the civilizing work of the monks
and clergy during the Middle Ages?

14. Picture the work of the monasteries in handing on to western Europe
the arts and handicrafts and skilled occupations of Rome. Cite some
examples.

15. What civilizing problem, somewhat comparable to that of barbarian
Europe, have we faced in our national history? Why have we been able to
obtain results so much more rapidly?

CHAPTER VI

EDUCATION DURING THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES [1]


I. CONDITION AND PRESERVATION OF LEARNING

THE LOW INTELLECTUAL LEVEL. As was stated in the preceding chapter, the
lamp of learning burned low throughout the most of western Europe during
the period of assimilation and partial civilization of the barbarian
tribes. The western portion of the Roman Empire had been overrun, and rude
Germanic chieftains were establishing, by the law of might, new kingdoms
on the ruins of the old. The Germanic tribes had no intellectual life of
their own to contribute, and no intellectual tastes to be ministered unto.
With the destruction of cities and towns and country villas, with their
artistic and literary collections, much that represented the old culture
was obliterated, [2] and books became more and more scarce. [3] The
destruction was gradual, but by the beginning of the seventh century the
loss had become great. The Roman schools also gradually died out as the
need for an education which prepared for government and gave a knowledge
of Roman law passed away, and the type of education approved by the Church
was left in complete control of the field. As the security and leisure
needed for study disappeared, and as the only use for learning was now in
the service of the Church, education became limited to the narrow lines
which offered such preparation and to the few who needed it. Amid the
ruins of the ancient civilization the Church stood as the only
conservative and regenerative force, and naturally what learning remained
passed into its hands and under its control.

The result of all these influences and happenings was that by the
beginning of the seventh century Christian Europe had reached a very low
intellectual level, and during the seventh and eighth centuries conditions
grew worse instead of better. Only in England and Ireland, as will be
pointed out a little later, and in a few Italian cities, was there
anything of consequence of the old Roman learning preserved. On the
Continent there was little general learning, even among the clergy (R. 64
a). Many of the priests were woefully ignorant, [4] and the Latin writings
of the time contain many inaccuracies and corruptions which reveal the low
standard of learning even among the better educated of the clerical class.
The Church itself was seriously affected by the prevailing ignorance of
the period, and incorporated into its system of government and worship
many barbarous customs and practices of which it was a long time in
ridding itself. So great had become the ignorance and superstition of the
time, among priests, monks, and the people; so much had religion taken on
the worship of saints and relics and shrines; and so much had the Church
developed the sensuous and symbolic, that religion had in reality become a
crude polytheism instead of the simple monotheistic faith of the early
Church. Along scientific lines especially the loss was very great.
Scientific ideas as to natural phenomena disappeared, and crude and
childish ideas as to natural forces came to prevail. As if barbarian
chiefs and robber bands were not enough, popular imagination peopled the
world with demons, goblins, and dragons, and all sorts of superstitions
and supernatural happenings were recorded. Intercommunication largely
ceased; trade and commerce died out; the accumulated wealth of the past
was destroyed; and the old knowledge of the known world became badly
distorted, as is evidenced by the many crude mediaeval maps. (See Figure
46.) The only scholarship of the time, if such it might be called, was the
little needed by the Church to provide for and maintain its government and
worship. Almost everything that we to-day mean by civilization in that age
was found within the protecting walls of monastery or church, and these
institutions were at first too busy building up the foundations upon which
a future culture might rest to spend much time in preserving learning,
much less in advancing it.

[Illustration: FIG. 37. A TYPICAL MONASTERY of SOUTHERN EUROPE]

THE MONASTERIES DEVELOP SCHOOLS. In this age of perpetual lawlessness and
disorder the one opportunity for a life of repose and scholarly
contemplation lay in the monasteries. Here the rule of might and force was
absent (R. 52), and the timid, the devout, and the studiously inclined
here found a refuge from the turbulence and brutality of a rude
civilization. The early monasteries, and especially the monastery of Saint
Victor, at Marseilles, founded by Cassian in 404, had represented a
culmination of the western feeling of antagonism to all ancient learning,
but with the founding of Monte Cassino by Saint Benedict, in 529 A.D., and
the promulgation of the Benedictine rule (R. 43), a more liberal attitude
was shown. [5] This rule was adopted generally by the monasteries
throughout what is now Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and England, and the
Benedictine became the type for the monks of the early Middle Ages. To
this order we are largely indebted for the copying of books and the
preservation of learning throughout the mediaeval period.

The 48th rule of Saint Benedict, it will be remembered (R. 43), had
imposed reading and study as a part of the daily duty of every monk, but
had said nothing about schools. Subsequent regulations issued by superiors
had aimed at the better enforcement of this rule (R. 44), that the monks
might lead devout lives and know the Bible and the sacred writings of the
Church. Imposed at first as a matter of education and discipline for the
monks, this rule ultimately led to the establishment of schools and the
development of a system of monastic instruction. As youths were received
at an early age [6] into the monasteries to prepare for a monastic life,
it was necessary that they be taught to read if they were later to use the
sacred books. This led to the duty of instructing novices, which marks the
beginning of monastic instruction for those within the walls. As books
were scarce and at the same time necessary, and the only way to get new
ones was to copy from old ones, the monasteries were soon led to take up
the work once carried on by the publishing houses of ancient Rome, and in
much the same way. This made writing necessary, and the novices had to be
instructed carefully in this, as well as in reading. [7] The chants and
music of the Church called for instruction of the novices in music, and
the celebration of Easter and the fast and festival days of the Church
called for some rudimentary instruction in numbers and calculation.

Out of these needs rose the monastery school, the copying of manuscripts,
and the preservation of books. Due to their greater security and quiet the
monasteries became the leading teaching institutions of the early part of
the Middle-Age period, and those who wished their children trained for the
service of the Church gave them to the monasteries (R. 53 a). The
development of the monastic schools was largely voluntary, though from an
early date bishops and rulers began urging the monasteries to open schools
for boys in connection with their houses, and schools became in time a
regular feature of the monastic organization. From schools only for those
intending to take the vows (_oblati_), the instruction was gradually
opened, after the ninth century, to others (_externi_) not intending to
take the vows, and what came to be known as "outer" monastic schools were
in time developed.

[Illustration: FIG. 38. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF A MEDIAEVAL MONASTERY
(From an engraving by Viollet-le-Duc, dated 1718, of the Cistercian Abbey
of Cîteaux, in France) This monastery was founded in the forests of what
is now northeastern France, in 1198 A.D., and was the first of a reformed
Benedictine order, known as Cistercians. For an explanation of the
monastery, see the opposite page. (Note: explanation follows.)

_Explanation of the Monastery opposite_: The cross, by the roadside,
indicates the entrance gate. Passing through the orchards and fields, the
traveler reached the outer gate-house. At the almonry (_C_) food and drink
were given out; on the second floor rooms for the night could be had; in
the little chapel (_D_) prayers could be said; and in the stable (_F_) the
traveler's horse could be cared for for the night. An inner gate through
(_E_) opened into an inner court, around which were the barns, chicken-
yards, cow-sheds, etc. The Abbot lived at _H_. _G_ was a dormitory for the
lay brothers who did the heavy work of the monastery, and who entered the
church (_N_) at the rear through a special doorway (_S_). All of these
buildings were considered as outside the monastery proper.

Inside were the great church (_N_), with the library (_P_) in the rear.
Seven _scriptoria_ are shown on the side of the library building. _M_ was
the large dormitory for the monks, and _R_ the infirmary for old and sick
brothers. _I_ was the kitchen, _K_ was the dining-hall (refectory), and
_L_ the stairs to the upper dormitory rooms. _C_ and _E_ are two cloisters
with corridors on the four sides, somewhat similar to the cloisters shown
for the monastery on Plate I. The copying of books often took place in
these cloisters, though a _scriptorium_ was usually found under the
library, the library proper, as in Plate 2, being on the second floor
(_P_) and reached by a winding stair. A wall surrounded the monastery
grounds, and a stream of running water passed through them.]

The monasteries became the preservers of learning. Another need developed
the copying of pagan books, and incidentally the preservation of some of
the best of Roman literature. The language of the Church very naturally
was Latin, as it was a direct descendant of Roman life, governmental
organization, citizenship, and education. Though stern in his manner, he
was (as I grew to learn) extraordinarily, even extravagantly, kind; and
my grandmother lived for me, her eldest grandchild. Years afterwards I
gathered that in the circle of her acquaintance she passed for a satirical,
slightly imperious, lady: and I do seem to remember that she suffered fools
with a private reserve of mirth. But she loved her own with a thoroughness
which extended--good housewife that she was--down to the last small
office.

In short, here were two of the best and most affectionate grandparents
in the world, who did what they knew to make a child happy all the
week.

But in religion they were strict evangelicals, and on Sunday they took me
to public worship and acquainted me with Hell. From my eighth to my twelfth
year I lived on pretty close terms with Hell, and would wake up in the
night and lie awake with the horror of it upon me. Oddly enough, I
had no very vivid fear for myself--or if vivid it was but occasional and
rare.
Little pietistic humbug that I was, I fancied myself among the elect: but I
had a desperate assurance that both my parents were damned, and I loved
them too well to find the conviction bearable. To this day I wonder what
kept me from tackling my father on the state of his soul. The result
would have been extremely salutary for me: for he had an easy sense
of humour, a depth of conviction of his own which he united with limitless
tolerance, and a very warm affection for his mother-in-law. Let it suffice
that I did not: but for two or three years at least my childhood was
tormented with visions of Hell derived from the pulpit and mixed up with
two terrible visions derived from my reading--the ghost of an evil old
woman in red-heeled slippers from Sir Walter Scott's story, _The Tapestried
Room_, and a jumble of devils from a chapter of Samuel Warren's _Diary
of a Late Physician_. I had happened on these horrors among the dull contents
of my grandfather's book-case.

For three or four years these companions--the vision of Hell
particularly and my parents in it--murdered my childish sleep. Then, for
no reason that I can give any account of, it all faded, and boy or man I
have never been troubled at all by Hell or the fear of it.

The strangest part of the whole affair is that no priest, from first to
last, has ever spoken to me in private of any life but this present
one, or indeed about religion at all. I suppose there must be some instinct
in the sacerdotal mind which warns it off certain cases as hopeless
from the first . . . and yet I have always been eager to discuss
serious things with the serious.

There has been no great loss, though--apart from the missing of
sociableness--if one may judge the arguments that satisfy my clerical
friends from the analogies they use in the pulpit. The subject of a future
life is one, to be sure, which can hardly be discussed without resort
to analogy. But there are good and bad analogies, and of all bad ones
that which grates worst upon the nerves of a man who will have clear
thinking (to whatever it lead him) is the common one of the seed and
the flower.

"The flowers that we behold each year In chequer'd meads their heads
to rear, New rising from the tomb; The eglantines and honey daisies, And
all those pretty smiling faces That still in age grow young-- Even
those do cry That though men die, Yet life from death may come,"
Wrote John Hagthorpe in verses which generations of British schoolboys
have turned into Latin alcaics; and how often have we not 'sat under'
this argument in church at Easter or when the preacher was improving
a Harvest Festival?

Examine it, and you see at once that the argument is not _in pari materia_;
that all the true correspondence between man and the flower-seed
begins and ends in this world. As the seed becomes a plant, blossoms and
leaves the seeds of other flowers, so of seed man is begotten,
flourishes and dies, leaving his seed behind him--all in this world. The
'seed' argument makes an illicit jump from one world to another after
all its analogies have been met and satisfied on this side of the grave.
If flowers went to heaven and blossomed there (which is possible
indeed, but is not contended) it might be cogent. As things are, one
might as validly reason from the man to prove that flowers go to heaven,
as from the flower to prove that man goes thither. St. Paul (as I do not
forget) uses the similitude of the seed: but his argument is a totally
different one. St. Paul bids us not be troubled in what form the dead
shall be raised; for as we sow "not the body that shall be, but bare grain,
it may chance of wheat or of some other grain," so God will raise
the dead in what form it pleases Him: in other words, he tells us
that since bare grain may turn into such wonderful and wonderfully
different things as wheat, barley, oats, rye, in this world, we
need not marvel that bare human bodies planted here should be raised
in wonderful form hereafter.

Objections may be urged against this illustration: I am only
concerned to point out that it illustrates an argument entirely
different from the common pulpit one, which (I suspect) we should have
to endure far less frequently were it our custom to burn our dead,
and did not interment dig a trap for facile rhetoric.

Further, St. Paul's particular warning, if it do not consciously contain,
at least suggests, a general warning against interpreting the
future life in terms of this one, whereas its delights and pains can have
little or nothing in common with ours. We try to imagine them by expanding
or exaggerating and perpetuating ours--or some of them; but the attempt
is demonstrably foolish, and leads straight to its own defeat. It comes
of man's incapacity to form a conception of Eternity, or at any
rate to grasp and hold it long enough to reason about it; by reason
of which incapacity he falls back upon the easier, misleading
conception of 'Everlasting Life.'

In Eternity time is not: a man dies into it to-day
and awakes (say) yesterday, for in Eternity yesterday and to-day and
to-morrow are one, and ten thousand years is as one day. This vacuum
of time you may call 'Everlasting Life,' but it clearly differs from what
men ordinarily and almost inevitably understand by 'Everlasting
Life,' which to them is an endless prolongation of time.

Therefore, when they imagine heaven as consisting of an endless
prolongation and exaggeration or rarefication of such pleasures as we know,
they invite the retort, "And pray what would become of any one of our
known pleasures, or even of our conceivable pleasures, if it were made
everlasting?" As Jowett asked, with his usual dry sagacity, in his Introduction
to the _Phaedo_--
"What is the pain that does not become deadened after a thousand years? or
what is the nature of that pleasure or happiness which never wearies
by monotony? Earthly pleasures and pains are short in proportion as
they are keen, of any others which are both intense and lasting we have no
experience and can form no idea. . . . To beings constituted as we are
the monotony of singing psalms would be as great an affliction as the
pains of hell, and might even be pleasantly interrupted by them."
This is trenchant enough, and yet we perceive that the critic is setting up
his rest upon the very fallacy he attacks--the fallacy of using 'Eternity'
and 'Everlasting Life' as convertible terms.
He neatly enough reduces to absurdity the prolongation, through endless
time, of pleasures which delight us because they are transitory: he does
not see, or for the moment forgets, that Eternity is not a
prolongation of time at all, but an absolute negation of it.

There seems to be no end to the confusion of men's thought on this
subject. Take, for example, this extract from our late Queen's private
journal (1883):--
"After luncheon saw the great poet Tennyson in dearest Albert's room for
nearly an hour; and most interesting it was. He is grown very old, his
eyesight much impaired. But he was very kind. Asked him to sit down.

He talked of many friends he had lost, and what it would be if he did not
feel and know that there was another world where there would be no
partings: and then he spoke with horror of the unbelievers and philosophers
who would make you believe that there was no other world, no
immortality, who tried to explain all away in a miserable manner. We
agreed that, were such a thing possible, God, who is Love, would be far
more cruel than any human being."
It was, no doubt, a touching and memorable interview--these two, aged and
great, meeting at a point of life when grandeur and genius alike
feel themselves to be lonely, daily more lonely, and exchanging beliefs
upon that unseen world where neither grandeur nor genius can plead more
than that they have used their gifts for good. And yet was not Tennyson
yielding to the old temptation to interpret the future life in terms of
this one? Speculation will not carry us far upon this road; yet, so far
as we can, let us carry clear thinking with us. Cruelty implies the
infliction of pain: and there can be no pain without feeling. What cruelty,
then, can be inflicted on the dead, if they have done with feeling?
Or what on the living, if they live in a happy delusion and pass into
nothingness without discovering the cheat? Let us hold most firmly that
there has been no cheat; but let us also be reasonable and admit that,
if cheat there be, it cannot also be cruel, since everything that
would make it a cheat would also blot out completely all chance of
discovery, and therefore all pain of discovering.

This is a question on which, beyond pleading that what little we
say ought to be (but
seldom is) the result of clear thinking, I propose to say little, not only
because here is not the place for metaphysics, but because--to
quote Jowett again--"considering the 'feebleness of the human
faculties and the uncertainty of the subject,' we are inclined to
believe that the fewer our words the better.

At the approach of death there is not much said: good men are too
honest to go out of the world professing more than they know. There is
perhaps no important subject about which, at any time, even religious
people speak so little to one another."
I would add that, in my opinion, many men fall into this reticence because
as they grow older the question seems to settle itself without argument,
and they cease by degrees to worry themselves about it. It dies in
sensible men almost insensibly with the death of egoism. At twenty we
are all furious egoists; at forty or thereabouts--and especially if
we have children, as at forty every man ought--our centre of gravity has
completely shifted. We care a great deal about what happens to the next
generation, we care something about our work, but about ourselves and
what becomes of us in the end I really think we care very little. By this
time, if we have taken account of ourselves, ourselves are by no
means so splendidly interesting as they used to be, but subjects rather
of humorous and charitable comprehension.

Of all the opening passages in Plato--master of beautiful openings--I like
best that of the _Laws_. The scene is Crete; the season, midsummer; and
on the long dusty road between Cnosus and the cave and temple of Zeus the
three persons of the dialogue--strangers to one another, but bound on a
common pilgrimage--join company and fall into converse together.

One is an Athenian, one a Cretan, the third a Lacedaemonian, and all are
elderly.
Characteristically, the invitation to talk comes from the Athenian.

"It will pass the time pleasantly," he suggests; "for I am told that
the distance from Cnosus to the cave and temple of Zeus is considerable,
and doubtless there are shady places under the lofty trees which
will protect us from the scorching sun. Being no longer young, we may often
stop to rest beneath them, and get over the whole journey without
difficulty, beguiling the time by conversation."
"Yes, Stranger," answers Cleinias the Cretan, "and if we proceed onward
we shall come to groves of cypresses, which are of rare height and
beauty, and there are green meadows in which we may repose and
converse."
"Very good."
"Very good indeed; and still better when we see them. Let us move
on cheerily."
So, now walking, anon pausing in the shade to rest, the three
strangers beguile their journey, which (as the Athenian was made,
by one of Plato's cunning touches, to foresee) is a long one; and
the dialogue, moving with their deliberate progress, extends to a
length which no doubt in the course of some 2,300 years has frightened
away many thousands of general readers.

Yet its slow amplitude, when you come to think of it, is appropriate; for
these elderly men are in no hurry, although they have plenty to talk
about, especially on the subjects of youth and religion.
"They have," says Jowett, "the feelings of old age about youth, about the
state, about human things in general. Nothing in life seems to be of
much importance to them: they are spectators rather than actors, and men
in general appear to the Athenian speaker to be the playthings of the
gods and of circumstances. Still they have a fatherly care of
the young, and are deeply impressed by sentiments of religion. . . ."
"Human affairs," says the Athenian, "are hardly worth considering in
earnest, and yet we must be in earnest about them--a sad necessity constrains
us. . . .

And so I say that about serious matters a man should be serious, and about
a matter which is not serious he should not be serious; and that God
is the natural and worthy object of our most serious and blessed endeavours.
For man, as I said before, is made to be the plaything of God, and this,
truly considered, is the best of him; wherefore also every man and woman
should walk seriously and pass life in the noblest of pastimes, and
be of another mind from what they are at present."
But on the subject of youth, too, our Athenian is anxiously, albeit
calmly, serious: and especially on the right education of youth, "for,"
says he, "many a victory has been and will be suicidal to the victors;
but education is never suicidal." By education he explains himself
to mean--
"That education in virtue from youth upwards which makes a man eagerly
pursue the ideal perfection of citizenship, and teaches him how rightly
to rule and how to obey. This is the only education which, upon our
view, deserves the name; and that other sort of training which aims at the
acquisition of wealth or bodily strength, or mere cleverness apart from
intelligence and justice is mean and illiberal, and is not worthy to be
called education at all."
Plato wrote this dialogue when over seventy, an age which for many
years (if I live) I shall be able to contemplate as respectable.

Yet, though speaking at a guess, I say pretty confidently that the talk of
these three imaginary interlocutors of his upon youth, and the feeling
that colours it, convey more of the truth about old age than does Cicero's
admired treatise on that subject or any of its descendants. For these
treatises start with the false postulate that age is concerned about
itself, whereas it is the mark of age to be indifferent about itself, and
this mark of indifference deepens with the years.
Both taught
at Canterbury, and raised the cathedral school there to high rank. In 674
the monastery at Wearmouth was founded, and in 682 its companion Yarrow.
These were endowed with books from Rome and Vienne, and soon became famous
for the instruction they provided. It was at the twin monasteries of
Wearmouth and Yarrow that the Venerable Bede (673-735), whose
_Ecclesiastical History of England_ gives us our chief picture of
education in Britain in his time, was educated and remained as a lifelong
student. [17] As a result of all these efforts a number of northern
monasteries, as well as a few of the cathedral schools, early became
famous for their libraries, scholars, and learning. This culture in
Ireland and Britain was of a much higher standard than that obtaining on
the Continent at the time, because the classical inheritance there had
been less corrupted.

THE CATHEDRAL SCHOOL AT YORK. One of the schools which early attained fame
was the cathedral school at York, in northern England. This had, by the
middle of the eighth century, come to possess for the time a large
library, and contained most of the important Latin authors and textbooks
then known (R. 61). In this school, under the _scholasticus_ Aelbert, was
trained a youth by the name of Alcuin, born in or near York, about 735
A.D. In a poem describing the school (R. 60), he gives a good portrayal of
the instruction he received, telling how the learned Aelbert "moistened
thirsty hearts with diverse streams of teaching and the varied dews of
learning," and sorted out "youths of conspicuous intelligence" to whom he
gave special attention. Alcuin afterward succeeded Aelbert as
_scholasticus_, and was widely known as a gifted teacher. Well aware of
the precarious condition of learning amid such a rude and uncouth society,
he handed on to his pupils the learning he had received, and imbued them
with something of his own love for it and his anxiety for its preservation
and advancement. It was this Alcuin who was soon to give a new impetus to
the development of schools and the preservation of learning in Frankland.

CHARLEMAGNE AND ALCUIN. In 768 there came to the throne as king of the
great Frankish nation one of the most distinguished and capable rulers of
all time--a man who would have been a commanding personality in any age or
land. His ancestors had developed a great kingdom, and it was his
grandfather who had defeated the Saracens at Tours (p. 113) and driven
them back over the Pyrenees into Spain. This man Charlemagne easily stands
out as one of the greatest figures of all history. For five hundred years
before and after him there is no ruler who matched him in insight, force,
or executive capacity. He is particularly the dominating figure of
mediaeval times. Born in an age of lawlessness and disorder, he used every
effort to civilize and rule as intelligently as possible the great
Frankish kingdom. Wars he waged to civilize and Christianize the Saxon
tribes of northern Germany, to reduce the Lombards of northern Italy to
order, and to extend the boundaries of the Frankish nation. At his death,
in 814, his kingdom had succeeded to most of the western possessions of
the old Roman Empire, including all of what to-day comprises France,
Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland, large portions of what is now western
Germany and northern Italy, and portions of northern Spain. (See Figure
41.)

Realizing better than did his bishops and abbots the need for educational
facilities for the nobles and clergy, he early turned his attention to
securing teachers capable of giving the needed instruction. These, though,
were scarce and hard to obtain. After two unsuccessful efforts to obtain a
master scholar to become, as it were, his minister of education, he
finally succeeded in drawing to his court perhaps the greatest scholar and
teacher in all England. At Parma, in northern Italy, Charlemagne met
Alcuin, in 781, and invited him to leave York for Frankland. After
obtaining the consent of his archbishop and king, Alcuin accepted, and
arrived, with three assistants, at Charlemagne's court, in 782, to take up
the work of educational propaganda in Frankland.

This monastery, located on a high hill and resembling a mediaeval fortress
as one approaches it, was founded in 1341 by a Florentine merchant. The
picture shows the cloisters and interior court. Eighteen cells, two
churches, and other rooms are entered from the cloisters. A few monks were
still in residence there late as 1905, one of whom is seen, but the
monastery was then in the process of being closed by the Italian
Government.]

The plight in which he found learning was most deplorable, presenting a
marked contrast to conditions in England. Learning had been almost
obliterated during the two centuries of wild disorder from 600 on. From
600 to 850 has often been called the darkest period of the Dark Ages, and
Alcuin arrived when Frankland was at its worst. The monastic and cathedral
schools which had been established earlier had in large part been broken
up, and the monasteries had become places for the pensioning of royal
favorites and hence had lost their earlier religious zeal and
effectiveness. The abbots and bishops possessed but little learning, and
the lower clergy, recruited largely from bondmen, were grossly ignorant,
greatly to the injury of the Church. The copying of books had almost
ceased, and learning was slowly dying out.

THE PALACE SCHOOL. There had for some time been a form of school connected
with the royal court, known as the _palace school_, though the study of
letters had played but a small part in it. To the reorganization of this
school Alcuin first addressed himself, introducing into it elementary
instruction in that learning of which he was so fond. The school included
the princes and princesses of the royal household, relatives, attachés,
courtiers, and, not least in importance as pupils, the king and queen. To
meet the needs of such a heterogeneous circle was no easy task.

The instruction which Alcuin provided for the younger members of the
circle was largely of the question and answer (catechetical) type, both
questions and answers being prepared by Alcuin beforehand and learned by
the pupils. Fortunately examples of Alcuin's instruction have been
preserved to us in a dialogue prepared for the instruction of Pepin, a son
of Charlemagne, then sixteen years old (R. 62). With the older members the
questions and answers were oral. For all, though, the instruction was of a
most elementary nature, ranging over the elements of the subjects of
instruction of the time. Poetry, arithmetic, astronomy, the writings of
the Fathers, and theology are mentioned as having been studied.
Charlemagne learned to read Latin, but is said never to have mastered the
art of writing. It was not an easy position for any one to fill. To quote
from West's description: [18]

    Charles wanted to know everything and to know it at once. His strong,
    uncurbed nature eagerly seized on learning, both as a delight for
    himself and a means of giving stability to his government, and so,
    while he knew he must be docile, he was at the same time imperious.
    Alcuin knew how to meet him, and at need could be either patiently
    jocular or grave and reproving. Thus, on one occasion when he had been
    informed of the great learning of Augustine and Jerome, he impatiently
    demanded of Alcuin, "Why can I not have twelve clerks such as these?"
    Twelve Augustines and Jeromes! and to be made arise at the king's
    bidding! Alcuin was shocked. "What!" he discreetly rejoined, "the Lord
    of heaven and earth had but two such, and wouldst thou have twelve?"
    But his personal affection for the king was most unselfish, and he
    consequently took great delight in stimulating his desire for
    learning....

    He studied everything Alcuin set before him, but had special anxiety
    to learn all about the moon that was needed to calculate Easter. With
    such an eager and impatient pupil as Charles, the other scholars were
    soon inspired to beset Alcuin with endless puzzling questions, and
    there are not wanting evidences that some of them were disposed to
    levity and even carped at his teachings. But he was indefatigable,
    rising with the sun to prepare for teaching. In one of his poetical
    exercises he says of himself that "as soon as the ruddy charioteer of
    the dawn suffuses the liquid deep with the new light of day, the old
    man rubs the sleep of night from his eyes and leaps at once from his
    couch, running straightway into the fields of the ancients to pluck
    their flowers of correct speech and scatter them in sport before his
    boys."

CHARLEMAGNE'S PROCLAMATIONS ON EDUCATION. After reorganizing the palace
school, Alcuin and Charlemagne turned their attention to the improvement
of education among the monks and clergy throughout the realm. The first
important service was the preparation and sending out of a carefully
collected and edited series of sermons to the churches containing, "in two
volumes, lessons suitable for the whole year and for each separate
festival, and free from error." These Charlemagne ordered used in the
churches (R. 63). He also says, "we have striven with watchful zeal to
advance the cause of learning, which has been almost forgotten by the
negligence of our ancestors; and, by our example, also we invite those
whom we can to master the study of the liberal arts," meaning thereby to
incite the bishops and clergy to a study of the learning of the mediaeval
time. The volumes and letter were sent out in 786, four years after
Alcuin's arrival at the court. Further to aid in the revival of learning,
Charlemagne, in 787, imported a number of monks from Italy, who were
capable of giving instruction in arithmetic, singing, and grammar, and
sent them to the principal monasteries to teach.

In 787 the first general proclamation on education of the Middle Ages was
issued (R. 64 a), and from it we can infer much as to the state of
learning among the monks and clergy of the time. In this document the king
gently reproves the abbots of his realm for their illiteracy, and exhorts
them to the study of letters. The signature is Charlemagne's, but the hand
is Alcuin's. In it he tells the abbots, in commenting on the fact that
they had sent letters to him telling him that "sacred and pious prayers"
were being offered in his behalf, that he recognized in "most of these
letters both correct thoughts and uncouth expressions; because what pious
devotion dictated faithfully to the mind, the tongue, uneducated on
account of the neglect of study, was not able to express in a letter
without error." He therefore commands the abbots neither to neglect the
study of letters, if they wish to have his favor, nor to fail to send
copies of his letter "to all your suffragans and fellow bishops, and to
all the monasteries." Two years later (789) Charlemagne supplemented this
by a further general admonition (R. 64 b) to the ministers and clergy of
his realm, exhorting them to live clean and just lives, and closing with:

    And let schools be established in which boys may learn to read.
    Correct carefully the Psalms, the signs in writing, the songs, the
    calendar, the grammar, in each monastery and bishopric, and the
    catholic book; because often some desire to pray to God properly, but
    they pray badly because of incorrect books.

In 802 he further commanded that "laymen shall learn thoroughly the Creed
and the Lord's Prayer" (R. 64 c). Finally, in his enthusiasm for schools,
Charlemagne went so far as to direct that "every one should send his son
to school to study letters, and that the child should remain at school
with all diligence until he should become well instructed in learning."
Charlemagne, of course, was addressing freemen of the court and the
official classes. That he ever meant to include the children of the
laboring classes, or that the idea of compulsory education ever entered
his head, may well be doubted.

EFFECT OF THE WORK OF CHARLEMAGNE AND ALCUIN. The actual results of the
work of Charlemagne and Alcuin were, after all, rather meager. The
difficulties they faced are almost beyond our comprehension. Nobles and
clergy were alike ignorant and uncouth. There seemed no place to begin. It
may be said that by Charlemagne's work he greatly widened the area of
civilization, created a new Frankish-Roman Empire to be the inheritor of
the civilization and culture of the old one, checked the decline in
learning and reawakened a desire for study, and that he began the
substitution of ideas for might as a ruling force among the tribes under
his rule. That for a time he gave an important impetus to the study of
letters, which resulted in a real revival in the educational work of some
of the monasteries and cathedral schools, seems certain. Men knew more of
books and wrote better Latin than before, and those who wished to learn
found it easier to do so. The state of society and the condition of the
times, however, were against any large success for such an ambitious
educational undertaking, and after the death of Charlemagne, the division
of his empire, and the invasions of the Northmen, education slowly
declined again, though never to quite the level it had reached when
Charlemagne came to the throne. In a few schools there was no decline, and
these became the centers of learning of the future. Charlemagne having
substituted merit for favoritism in his realm, promoting to be bishops and
abbots the most learned men of his time, many of these became zealous
workers in the cause of education and did much to keep up and advance
learning after his death.

Among the most able of his helpers was Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans. He
carried out most thoroughly in his diocese the instructions of the king,
giving to his clergy the following directions:

    Let the priests hold schools in the towns and villages, and if any of
    the faithful wish to entrust their children to them for the learning
    of letters, let them not refuse to receive and teach such children.
    Moreover, let them teach them from pure affection, remembering that it
    is written, "the wise shall shine as the splendor of the firmament,"
    and "they that instruct many in righteousness shall shine as the stars
    forever and forever." And let them exact no price from the children
    for their teaching, nor receive anything from them, save what their
    parents may offer voluntarily and from affection.

Another able assistant was Alcuin himself, who, after fourteen years of
strenuous service at Charlemagne's court, was rewarded by the king with
the office of Abbot at the monastery of Saint Martin, at Tours. There he
spent the last eight years of his life in teaching, copying manuscripts,
and writing letters to bishops and abbots regarding the advancement of
religion and learning. The work of Alcuin in directing the copying of
manuscripts has been described. In a letter to Charlemagne, soon after his
appointment, he reviews his labors, contrasts the state of learning in
England and Frankland, and appeals to Charlemagne for books from England
to copy (R. 65). So important was his work as a teacher as well that at
his death, in 814, most of the important educational centers of the
kingdom were in the hands of his former pupils. Perhaps the most important
of all these was Rabanus Maurus, who became head of the monastery school
at Fulda. We shall learn more of him in the next chapter.

[Illustration: FIG. 42. WHERE THE DANES RAVAGED ENGLAND.]

NEW INVASIONS; THE NORTHMEN. Five years after Alcuin went to Frankland to
help Charlemagne revive learning in his kingdom, a fresh series of
barbarian invasions began with the raiding of the English coast by the
Danes. In raid after raid, extending over nearly a hundred years, these
Danes gradually overran all of eastern and central England from London
north to beyond Whitby, plundering and burning the churches and
monasteries, and destroying books and learning everywhere. By the Peace of
Wedmore, effected by King Alfred in 878, the Danes were finally given
about one half of England, and in return agreed to settle down and accept
Christianity. The damage done by these invaders was very large, and King
Alfred, in his introduction to an Anglo-Saxon translation of Pope
Gregory's _Pastoral Care_ (R. 66), gives a gloomy picture of the
destruction wrought to the churches and the decay of learning in England.

Other bands of these Northmen (Danes and Norwegians) began to prey on the
northern coast of Frankland, and in the tenth century seized all the coast
of what is now northern France and down as far as Paris and Tours. From
Tours to Corbie (see Figure 41) churches and monasteries were pillaged and
burned, Tours and Corbie with their libraries both perishing. Amiens and
Paris were laid siege to, and disorder reigned throughout northern
Frankland. _The Annals of Xanten_ and the _Annals of Saint Vaast_, two
mediaeval chronicles of importance, give gloomy pictures of this period.
Three selections will illustrate:

    According to their custom the Northmen plundered East and West Frisia
    and burned ... towns.... With their boats filled with immense booty,
    including both men and goods, they returned to their own country. [19]

    The Normans inflicted much harm in Frisia and about the Rhine. A
    mighty army of them collected by the river Elbe against the Saxons,
    and some of the Saxon towns were besieged, others burned, and most
    terribly did they oppress the Christians. [20]

    The Northmen ceased not to take Christian people captive and kill
    them, and to destroy churches and houses and burn villages. Through
    all the streets lay bodies of the clergy, of laymen, nobles, and
    others, of women, children, and suckling babes. There was no road or
    place where the dead did not lie, and all who saw Christian people
    slaughtered were filled with sorrow and despair. [21]

After much destruction, Rollo, Duke of the Normans, finally accepted
Christianity, in 912, and agreed to settle down in what has ever since
been known as _Normandy_. From here portions of the invaders afterward
passed over to England in the Norman Conquest of 1066. This was the last
of the great German tribes to move, and after they had raided and
plundered and settled down and accepted Christianity, western Europe,
after six centuries of bloodshed and pillage and turmoil and disorder, was
at last ready to begin in earnest the building-up of a new civilization
and the restoration of the old learning.

WORK OF ALFRED IN ENGLAND. The set-back to learning caused by this latest
deluge of barbarism was a serious one, and one from which the land did not
recover for a long time. In northern Frankland and in England the results
were disastrous. The revival which Charlemagne had started was checked,
and England did not recover from the blow for centuries. Even in the parts
of England not invaded and pillaged, education sadly declined as a result
of nearly a century of struggle against the invaders (R. 66). Alfred,
known to history as _Alfred the Great_, who ruled as English king from 871
to 901, made great efforts to revive learning in his kingdom. Probably
inspired by the example of Charlemagne, he established a large palace
school (R. 68), to the support of which he devoted one eighth of his
income; he imported scholars from Mercia and Frankland (R. 67); restored
many monasteries; and tried hard to revive schools and encourage learning
throughout his realm, and with some success. [22] With the great decay of
the Latin learning he tried to encourage the use of the native Anglo-Saxon
language, [23] and to this end translated books from Latin into Anglo-
Saxon for his people. In his Introduction to Gregory's volume (R. 66) he
expresses the hope, "If we have tranquillity enough, that all the free-
born youth now in England, who are rich enough to be able to devote
themselves to it ... be set to learn ... English writing," while those who
were to continue study should then be taught Latin. The coming of the
Normans in 1066, with the introduction of Norman-French as the official
language of the court and government, for a time seriously interfered with
the development of that native English learning of which Alfred wrote.

In the preceding chapter and in this one we have traced briefly the great
invasions, or migrations, which took place in western Europe, and
indicated somewhat the great destruction they wrought within the bounds of
the old Empire. In this chapter we have traced the beginnings of Christian
schools to replace the ones destroyed, the preservation of learning in the
monasteries, and the efforts of Charlemagne and Alfred to revive learning
in their kingdoms. In the chapter which follows we shall describe the
mediaeval system of education as it had evolved by the twelfth century,
after which we shall be ready to pass to the beginnings of that Revival of
Learning which ultimately resulted in the rediscovery of the learning of
the ancient world.

CHAPTER VII

EDUCATION DURING THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES


II. SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED


1. _Elementary instruction and schools_

MONASTIC AND CONVENTIONAL SCHOOLS. In the preceding chapters we found
that, by the tenth century, the monasteries had developed both inner
monastic schools for those intending to take the vows (oblati), and outer
monastic schools for those not so intending (externi). The distinction in
name was due to the fact that the _oblati_ were from the first considered
as belonging to the brotherhood, participating in the religious services
and helping the monks at their work. The others were not so admitted, and
in all monasteries of any size a separate building, outside the main
portion of the monastery (see Figure 38), was provided for the outer
school. A similar classification of instruction had been evolved for the
convents.

[Illustration: FIG. 43. AN OUTER MONASTIC SCHOOL
(After an old wood engraving)]

The instruction in the inner school was meager, and in the outer school
probably even more so. Reading, writing, music, simple reckoning,
religious observances, and rules of conduct constituted the range of
instruction. Reading was taught by the alphabet method, as among the
Romans, and writing by the use of wax tablets and the stylus. Much
attention was given to Latin pronunciation, as had been the practice at
Rome. As Latin by this time had practically ceased to be a living tongue,
outside the Church and perhaps in Central Italy, the difficulties of
instruction were largely increased. The Psalter, or book of Latin psalms,
was the first reading book, and this was memorized rather than read. Copy-
books, usually wax, with copies expressing some scriptural injunction,
were used. Music, being of so much importance in the church services,
received much time and attention. In arithmetic, counting and finger
reckoning, after the Roman plan, was taught. Latin was used in
conversation as much as possible, some of the old lesson books much
resembling conversation books of to-day in the modern languages (R. 75).
Special attention seems to have been given to teaching rules of conduct to
the _oblati_, [1] and much corporal punishment was used to facilitate
learning. Up to the eleventh century this instruction, meager as it was,
constituted the whole of the preparatory training necessary for the study
of theology and a career in the Church. In the convents similar schools
were developed, though, as stated in the last chapter, much more attention
was given to the education of those not intending to take the vows.

SONG AND PARISH SCHOOLS. In the cathedral churches, and other larger non-
cathedral churches, the musical part of the service was very important,
and to secure boys for the choir and for other church services these
churches organized what came to be known as _song schools_ (R. 70). In
these a number of promising boys were trained in the same studies and in
much the same way as were boys in the monastery schools, except that much
more attention was given to the musical instruction. The students in these
schools were placed under the _precentor_ (choir director) of the
cathedral, or other large church, the _scholasticus_ confining his
attention to the higher or more literary instruction provided. The boys
usually were given board, lodging, and instruction in return for their
services as choristers. As the parish churches in the diocese also came to
need boys for their services, parish schools of a similar nature were in
time organized in connection with them. It was out of this need, and by a
very slow and gradual evolution, that the parish school in western Europe
was developed later on.

CHANTRY SCHOOLS. Still another type of elementary school, which did not
arise until near the latter part of the period under consideration in this
chapter, but which will be enumerated here as descriptive of a type which
later became very common, came through wills, and the schools came to be
known as _chantry schools_, or _stipendary schools_. Men, in dying, who
felt themselves particularly in need of assistance for their misdeeds on
earth, would leave a sum of money to a church to endow a priest, or
sometimes two, who were to chant masses each day for the repose of their
souls. Sometimes the property was left to endow a priest to say mass in
honor of some special saint, and frequently of the Virgin Mary. As such
priests usually felt the need for some other occupation, some of them
began voluntarily to teach the elements of religion and learning to
selected boys, and in time it became common for those leaving money for
the prayers to stipulate in the will that the priest should also teach a
school. Usually a very elementary type of school was provided, where the
children were taught to know the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the Salutation
to the Virgin, certain psalms, to sign themselves rightly with the sign of
the cross, and perhaps to read and write (Latin). Sometimes, on the
contrary, and especially was this the case later on in England, a grammar
school was ordered maintained. After the twelfth century this type of
foundation (R. 73) became quite common.


2. _Advanced instruction_

CATHEDRAL AND HIGHER MONASTIC SCHOOLS. As the song schools developed the
cathedral schools were of course freed from the necessity of teaching
reading and writing, and could then develop more advanced instruction.
This they did, as did many of the monasteries, and to these advanced
schools those who felt the need for more training went. As grammar was,
throughout all the early part of the Middle Ages, the first and most
important subject of instruction, the advanced schools came to be known as
_grammar schools_, as well as cathedral or episcopal schools (R. 72). The
cathedral churches and monasteries of England and France early became
celebrated for the high character of their instruction (R. 71) and the
type of scholars they produced. All these schools, though, suffered a
serious set-back during the period of the Danish and Norman invasions,
many being totally destroyed. On the continent, due to the greater deluge
of barbarism and the more unsettled condition of society, more difficulty
was experienced in getting cathedral schools established, as the following
decree of the Lateran Church Council of 826 indicates:

    Complaints have been made that in some places no masters nor
    endowment for a grammar school is found. Therefore all bishops shall
    bestow all care and diligence, both for their subjects and for other
    places in which it shall be found necessary, to establish masters and
    teachers who shall assiduously teach grammar schools and the
    principles of the liberal arts, because in these chiefly the
    commandments of God are manifest and declared.

These two types of advanced schools--the cathedral or episcopal and the
monastic--formed what might be called the secondary-school system of the
early Middle Ages (Rs. 70, 71). They were for at least six hundred years
the only advanced teaching institutions in western Europe, and out of one
or the other of these two types of advanced schools came practically all
those who attained to leadership in the service of the Church in either of
its two great branches. Still more, out of the impetus given to advanced
study by the more important of these schools, the universities of a later
period developed; and numerous private gifts of lands and money were made
to establish grammar schools to supplement the work done by the cathedral
and other large church schools.

THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS. The advanced studies which were offered in the
more important monastery and cathedral schools comprised what came to be
known as _The Seven Liberal Arts_ [2] of the Middle Ages. The knowledge
contained in these studies, taught as the advanced instruction of the
period, represents the amount of secular learning which was intentionally
preserved by the Church from neglect and destruction during the period of
the barbarian deluges and the reconstruction of society.

These Seven Liberal Arts were comprised of two divisions, known as:

I. THE TRIVIUM:
   (1) Grammar;
   (2) Rhetoric;
   (3) Dialectic (Logic).

II. THE QUADRIVIUM:
    (4) Arithmetic;
    (5) Geometry;
    (6) Astronomy;
    (7) Music.

Philosophica_ of Gregory de Reisch.

The youth, having mastered the Hornbook (ABC's) and the rudiments of
learning (reading, writing, and the beginnings of music and numbers),
advances toward the temple of knowledge. Wisdom is about to place the key
in the lock of the door of the temple. On the door is written the word
_congruitas_, signifying Grammar. ("Gramaire first hath for to teche to
speke upon congruite.") On the first and second floors of the temple he
studies the Grammar of Donatus, and of Priscian, and at the first stage at
the left on the third floor he studies the Logic of Aristotle, followed by
the Rhetoric and Poetry of Tully, thus completing the _Trivium_. The
Arithmetic of Boethius also appears on the third floor. On the fourth
floor he completes the studies of the _Quadrivium_, taking in order the
Music of Pythagoras, Euclid's Geometry, and Ptolemy's Astronomy. The
student now advances to the study of Philosophy, studying successively
Physics, Seneca's Morals, and the Theology (or Metaphysics) of Peter
Lombard, the last being the goal toward which all has been directed.]

Beyond these came Ethics or Metaphysics, and the greatest of all studies,
Theology. This last represented the one professional study of the early
middle-age period, and was the goal toward which all the preceding studies
had tended. This mediaeval system of education is well summarized in the
drawing given on the opposite page, taken from an illuminated picture
inserted in a famous mediaeval manuscript, recopied at Basle, Switzerland,
in 1508.

Not all these studies were taught in every monastery or cathedral school.
Many of the lesser monasteries and schools offered instruction chiefly in
grammar, and only a little of the studies beyond. Others emphasized the
Trivium, and taught perhaps only a little of the second group. Only a few
taught the full range of mediaeval learning, and these were regarded as
the great schools of the times (R. 71).

Rhabanus Maurus (776-865), one of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages,
Abbot for years at Fulda, and a mediaeval textbook writer of importance,
has left us a good description of each of the Seven Liberal Arts studies
as they were developed in his day, and their use in the Christian scheme
of education (R. 74).


I. THE TRIVIUM

Of the three studies forming the _Trivium_, grammar always came first as
the basal subject. No uniformity existed for the other two.

1. GRAMMAR. The foundation and source of all the Liberal Arts was grammar,
it being, according to Maurus, "the science which teaches us to explain
the poets and historians, and the art which qualifies us to speak and
write correctly" (R. 74 a). In the introduction to an improved Latin
grammar, [3] published about 1119, grammar is defined as "The doorkeeper
of all the other sciences, the apt expurgatrix of the stammering tongue,
the servant of logic, the mistress of rhetoric, the interpreter of
theology, the relief of medicine, and the praiseworthy foundation of the
whole quadrivium." Figure 45, from one of the earliest books printed in
English, also emphasizes the great importance of grammar with the words:
"Wythout whiche science (s)ycherly alle other sciences in especial ben of
lytyl recomme(d)." In addition to grammar in the sense we know the study
to-day, grammar in the old Roman and mediaeval mind also included much of
what we know as the analytical side of the study of literature, such as
comparison, analysis, versification, prosody, word formations, figures of
speech, and vocal expression (R. 76). These were considered necessary to
enable one to read understandingly the Holy Scriptures, and hence, "though
the art be secular," says Maurus, "it has nothing unworthy about it."

[Illustration: FIG. 45. A SCHOOL: A LESSON IN GRAMMAR
(After a woodcut printed by Caxton in _The Mirror of the World_, 1481 (?).
From Blades' _Life and Typography of William Caxton_, ii, Plate LVI)

This is a good example of early English printing. Can you read it? This
"Old English," like the German type (see Fig. 26), shows the change in
Latin letters which came about with the copying of manuscripts during the
Middle Ages. After the invention of printing the English soon returned to
the Latin forms; the Germans are only now doing so.]

The leading textbook was that of Donatus, [4] written in the fourth
century, and Donatus (_donat_) and grammar came to be synonymous terms.
The text by Priscian, [5] written in the sixth century, was also
extensively used. The treatment in each was catechetical in form; that is,
questions and answers, which were learned. The text was of course in
Latin, and the teacher usually had the only copy, so that the pupils had
to learn from memory or copy from dictation. The cost of writing-material
usually precluded the latter method. After sufficient ability in grammar
had been attained, simple reading exercises or colloquies (R. 75), usually
of a religious or moralizing nature, were introduced, though where
permitted the Latin authors, especially Vergil, [6] were read. At Saint
Gall, in Switzerland, and at some other places, many Latin authors were
read; at Tours, on the other hand, we find the learned Abbot Alcuin saying
to the monks: "The sacred poets are sufficient for you; there is no reason
why you should sully your mind with the rank luxuriance of Vergil's
verse."

2. RHETORIC. Rhetoric, as defined by Maurus, was "the art of using secular
discourse effectively in the circumstances of daily life," and enabling
the preacher or missionary to put the divine message in eloquent and
impressive language (R. 74 b). Much of the old Roman rhetoric had been
taken over by grammar, but in its place was added a certain amount of
letter and legal documentary writing. The priest, it must be remembered,
became the secretary and lawyer of the Middle Ages, as well as the priest,
and upon him devolved the preparation of most of the legal papers of the
time, such as wills, deeds, proclamations, and other formal documents.
Accordingly the art of letter-writing [7] and the preparation of legal
documents were made a part of the study of rhetoric, and some study of
both the civil ("worldly") and canon (church) law was gradually
introduced.

3. DIALECTIC. Dialectic, or logic, says Maurus, is the science of
understanding, and hence the science of sciences (R. 74 c). By means of
its aid one was enabled to unmask falsehood, expose error, formulate
argument, and draw conclusions accurately. The study was one of
preparation for ethics and theology later on. Extracts from the works of
Aristotle, prepared by Boethius, and later his complete works, constituted
the texts used. While grammar was the great subject of the seven during
all the early Middle Ages, dialectic later came to take its place. After
the rise of the universities and the organization of schools of theology,
with theology more of a rational science and less a matter of dogma,
dialectic came to hold first place in importance as a preparation for the
disputations of the later Middle Ages. Theological questions formed the
practical exercises, and the schools doing most in dialectic attracted
many students because of this.

These three studies, constituting the _Trivium_, based as they were
directly on the old Roman learning and schools, contained more that was
within the teaching knowledge of the time than did the subjects of the
_Quadrivium_, and also subject-matter which was much more in demand.


II. THE QUADRIVIUM

The _trivial_ studies, in most cases before the thirteenth century,
sufficed to prepare for the study of theology, though those few who
desired to prepare thoroughly also studied the subjects of the
_quadrivium_. In schools not offering instruction in this advanced group
some of the elements of its four studies were often taught from the
textbooks in use for the _Trivium_. Particularly was this the case during
the early Middle Ages, when the knowledge of arithmetic, geometry, and
astronomy possessed by western Europe was exceedingly small. No regular
order in the study of the subjects of this group was followed.

4. ARITHMETIC. Naturally little could be done in this subject as long as
the Roman system of notation was in use (see footnote, i, p. 64), and the
Arabic notation was not known in western Christian Europe until the
beginning of the thirteenth century, and was not much used for two or
three centuries later. So far as arithmetic was taught before that time,
it was but little in advance of that given to novitiates in the
monasteries, except that much attention was devoted to an absurd study of
the properties of numbers, [8] and to the uses of arithmetic in
determining church days, calculating the date of Easter, and interpreting
passages in the Scriptures involving measurements (R. 74 d). The textbook
by Rhabanus Maurus _On Reckoning_, issued in 820, is largely in dialogue
(catechetical) form, and is devoted to describing the properties of
numbers, "odd, even, perfect, imperfect, composite, plane, solid,
cardinal, ordinal, adverbial, distributive, multiple, denunciative, etc.";
to pointing out the scriptural significance of number; [9] and to an
elaborate explanation of finger reckoning, after the old Roman plan (see
p. 65). Near the end of the tenth century Gerbert, [10] afterwards Pope
Sylvester II, devised a simple abacus-form for expressing numbers, simple
enough in itself, but regarded as wonderful in its day. This greatly
simplified calculation, and made work with large numbers possible. He also
devised an easier form for large divisions.

Gerbert's form for expressing numbers may be shown from the following
simple sum in addition:

_Arabic Form_    _Roman Form_    _Gerbert's Form_
                                         _M    C    X     I_

      1204                    MCCIV         I   II         IV
       538                 DXXXVIII              V  III  VIII
      2455                 MMCCCCLV        II   IV    V     V
       619                    DCXIX             VI    I    IX
     -----                ---------       -------------------
      4816              MMMMDCCCXVI        IV VIII    I    VI

No study of arithmetic of importance was possible, however, until the
introduction of Arabic notation and the use of the zero.

5. GEOMETRY. This study consisted almost entirely of geography and
reasoning as to geometrical forms until the tenth century, when Boethius'
work on _Geometry_, containing some extracts from Euclid, was discovered
by Gerbert. The geography of Europe, Asia, and Africa also was studied, as
treated in the textbooks of the time, and a little about plants and
animals as well was introduced. The nature of the geographic instruction
may be inferred from Figure 46, which reproduces one of the best world
maps of the day. The main geographical features of the known world can be
made out from this, but many of the mediaeval maps are utterly
unintelligible.

To illustrate the reasoning as to geometrical forms which preceded the
finding of Euclid we quote from Maurus, who says that the science of
geometry "found realization also at the building of the tabernacle and the
temple; and that the same measuring rod, circles, spheres, hemispheres,
quadrangles, and other figures were employed. The knowledge of all this
brings to him, who is occupied with it, no small gain for his spiritual
culture." (R. 74 e). After Gerbert's time some geometry proper and the
elements of land surveying were introduced. The real study of geometry in
Europe, however, dates from the twelfth century, when Euclid was
translated into Latin from the Arabic.

6. ASTRONOMY. In astronomy the chief purpose of the instruction was to
explain the seasons and the motions of the planets, to set forth the
wonders of the visible creation, and to enable the priests "to fix the
time of Easter and all other festivals and holy days, and to announce to
the congregation the proper celebration of them." (R. 74 g).

[Illustration: FIG. 46. AN ANGLO-SAXON MAP OF THE WORLD
(From a tenth-century map in the British Museum)

This is one of the better maps of the period. Note the mixture of Biblical
and classical geography (Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Pillars of Hercules), and
the animal life (lion) introduced in the upper corner. The Mediterranean
Sea in the center, the Greek islands, the British isles, the Italian
peninsula, the Nile, and the northern African coast are easily recognized.
Western Europe, the best-known part of the world at that time, is very
poorly done.]

Even after Ptolemy's _Mechanism of the Heavens_ (p. 49) and Aristotle's
_On the Heavens_ had filtered across the Pyrenees from the Saracens, in
the eleventh century, the Ptolemaic theory of a flat earth located at the
center of the heavenly bodies and around which they all revolved, while a
very pleasing theological conception, was absolutely fatal to any
instruction in astronomy worth while and to any astronomical advance. All
mediaeval astronomy, too, was saturated with astrology, as the selection
on the motion of the heavenly bodies reproduced from Bartholomew Anglicus
shows (R. 77 b), and the supernatural was invoked to explain such
phenomena as meteors, comets, and eclipses. The Copernican theory of the
motion of the heavenly bodies was not published until 1543, and all our
modern ideas date from that time.

Physics was often taught as a part of the instruction in astronomy, and
consisted of lessons on the properties of matter (R. 77 a) and some of the
simple principles of dynamics. Little else of what we to-day know as
physics was then known.

7. MUSIC. Unlike the other studies of the _Quadrivium_, the instruction in
music was quite extensive, and from early times a good course in musical
theory was taught (R. 74 f). Boethius' _De Musica_, written at the
beginning of the sixth century, was the text used. Music entered into so
many activities of the Church that much naturally was made of it. The
organ, too, is an old instrument, going back to the second century B.C.,
and the organ with a keyboard to the close of the eleventh century. This
instrument added much to the value of the music course, and the hymns
composed by Christian musicians form an important part of our musical
heritage. [11] The cathedral school at Metz and the monastery at Saint
Gall became famous as musical centers, and of the work of one of the
teachers of music at Saint Gall (Notker) it was written by his biographer:
"Through different hymns, sequences, tropes, and litanies, through
different songs and melodies as well as through ecclesiastical science,
the pupils of this man made the church of God famous not merely in
Alemannia, but everywhere from sea to sea."

THE GREAT TEXTBOOKS OF THE MIDDLE AGES. While the textbooks mentioned
under the description of each of the Liberal Arts formed the basis of the
instruction given, most of the instruction before the twelfth century was
not given from editions of the original works, but from abridged
compendiums. Six of these were so famous and so widely used that each
deserves a few words of description.

1. _The Marriage of Mercury and Philology_, written by Martianus Capella,
between 410 and 427 A.D., was the first of the five great mediaeval
textbooks. Mercury, desiring to marry, finally settles on the learned
maiden Philology, and the seven bridesmaids--Grammar, Dialectic, Rhetoric,
Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy, and Music--enter in turn at the ceremony
and tell who they are and what they represent. The speeches of the seven
maidens summarized the ancient learning in each subject. This textbook was
more widely used during the Middle Ages than any other book.

2. _Boethius_ (475-524) was another important mediaeval textbook writer,
having prepared textbooks on dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and
ethics. Nearly all of what the Middle Ages knew of Aristotle's _Logic_ and
_Ethics_, and of the writings of Plato, were contained in the texts he
wrote. His _De Musica_ was used in the universities as a textbook until
near the middle of the eighteenth century.

3. _Cassiodorus_ [12] (c. 490-585), in his _On the Liberal Arts and
Sciences_, prepared a digest of each of the Seven Liberal Arts for
monastic use, fixing the number at seven by scriptural authority. [13]

4. _Isidore_, Bishop of Seville (c. 570-636), under the title of
_Etymologies_ or _Origines_, prepared an encyclopaedia of the ancient
learning for the use of the monks and clergy which was intended to be a
summary of all knowledge worth knowing. While he drew his knowledge from
the writings of the Greeks and Romans, with many of which he was familiar,
contrary to the attitude of Cassiodorus he forbade the monks and clergy to
make any use of them whatever. Cassiodorus was still in part a Roman;
Isidore was a full mediaeval.

5. _Alcuin_, a learned scholar of the eighth century, whom we met in the
preceding chapter (p. 140), wrote treatises on the studies of the
_Trivium_ and on astronomy which were used in many schools in Frankland.

6. _Maurus_. In 819 the learned monk of Fulda, Rhabanus Maurus, a pupil of
Alcuin, issued his volume _On the Instruction of the Clergy_, in the third
part of which he describes the uses and the subject-matter of each of the
Arts (R. 74). He also wrote texts on grammar and astronomy, and in 844
issued an encyclopaedia, _De Universo_, based largely on the work of
Isidore, but supplemented from other sources.

These were the great textbooks for the study of the _Trivium_ and the
_Quadrivium_ throughout all the early Middle Ages. Considering that they
were in manuscript form and were in one volume, [14] their extent and
scope can be imagined. The teacher usually had or had access to a copy,
though even a teacher's books in that day were few in number (R. 78).
Pupils had no books at all. These "great" texts were composed of brief
extracts, bits of miscellaneous information, and lists of names. Their
style was uninviting. They were at best a mere shell, compared with the
Greek and Roman knowledge which had been lost. Some of these books were in
question-and-answer (catechetical) form. Their purpose was not to
stimulate thinking, but to transmit that modicum of secular knowledge
needed for the service of the Church and as a preparation for the study of
the theological writings. For nearly eight hundred years education was
static, the only purpose of instruction being to transmit to the next
generation what the preceding one had known.  For such a period such
textbooks answered the purpose fairly well.


3. _Training of the nobility_

TENTH-CENTURY CONDITIONS. Following the death of Charlemagne and the
break-up of the empire held together by him, a period of organized anarchy
followed in western Europe. Authority broke down more completely than
before, and Europe, for protection, was forced to organize itself into a
great number of small defensive groups. Serfs, [15] freemen lacking land,
and small landowners alike came to depend on some nobleman for protection,
and this nobleman in turn upon some lord or overlord. For this protection
military service was rendered in return. The lord lived in his castle, and
the peasantry worked his land and supported him, fighting his battles if
the need arose. This condition of society was known as _feudalism_, and
the feudal relations of lord and vassal came to be the prevailing
governmental organization of the period. Feudalism was at best an
organized anarchy, suited to rude and barbarous times, but so well was it
adapted to existing conditions that it became the prevailing form of
government, and continued as such until a better order of society could be
evolved. With the invention of gunpowder, the rise of cities and
industries, the evolution of modern States by the consolidation of numbers
of these feudal governments, and the establishment of order and
civilization, feudalism passed out with the passing of the conditions
which gave rise to it. From the end of the ninth to the middle of the
thirteenth centuries it was the dominant form of government.

The life of the nobility under the feudal régime gave a certain
picturesqueness to what was otherwise an age of lawlessness and disorder.
The chief occupation of a noble was fighting, either in his own quarrel or
that of his overlord. It is hard for us to-day to realize how much
fighting went on then. Much was said about "honor," but quarrels were
easily started, and oaths were poorly kept. It was a day of personal feuds
and private warfare, and every noble thought it his right to wage war on
his neighbor at any time, without asking the consent of any one. [16] As a
preparation for actual warfare a series of mimic encounters, known as
tournaments, were held, in which it often happened that knights were
killed. In these encounters mounted knights charged one another with spear
and lance, performing feats similar to those of actual warfare. This was
the great amusement of the period, compared with which the German duel,
the Mexican bullfight, or the American game of football are mild sports.
The other diversions of the knights and nobles were hunting, hawking,
feasting, drinking, making love, minstrelsy, and chess. Intellectual
ability formed no part of their accomplishments, and a knowledge of
reading and writing was commonly regarded as effeminate.

To take this carousing, fighting, pillaging, ravaging, destructive, and
murderous instinct, so strong by nature among the Germanic tribes, and
refine it and in time use it to some better purpose, and in so doing to
increasingly civilize these Germanic lords and overlords, was the problem
which faced the Church and all interested in establishing an orderly
society in Europe. As a means of checking this outlawry the Church
established and tried to enforce the "Truce of God" (R. 79), and as a
partial means of educating the nobility to some better conception of a
purpose in life the Church aided in the development of the education of
chivalry, the first secular form of education in western Europe since the
days of Rome, and added its sanction to it after it arose.

THE EDUCATION OF CHIVALRY. This form of education was an evolution. It
began during the latter part of the ninth century and the early part of
the tenth, reached its maximum greatness during the period of the Crusades
(twelfth century), and passed out of existence by the sixteenth. The
period of the Crusades was the heroic age of chivalry. The system of
education which gradually developed for the children of the nobility may
be briefly described as follows:

1. _Page._ Up to the age of seven or eight the youth was trained at home,
by his mother. He played to develop strength, was taught the meaning of
obedience, trained in politeness and courtesy, and his religious education
was begun. After this, usually at seven, he was sent to the court of some
other noble, usually his father's superior in the feudal scale, though in
case of kings and feudal lords of large importance the children remained
at home and were trained in the palace school. From seven to fourteen the
boy was known as a page. He was in particular attached to some lady, who
supervised his education in religion, music, courtesy, gallantry, the
etiquette of love and honor, and taught him to play chess and other games.
He was usually taught to read and write the vernacular language, and was
sometimes given a little instruction in reading Latin. [17] To the lord he
rendered much personal service such as messenger, servant at meals, and
attention to guests. By the men he was trained in running, boxing,
wrestling, riding, swimming, and the use of light weapons.

2. _Squire._ At fourteen or fifteen he became a squire. While continuing
to serve his lady, with whom he was still in company, and continuing to
render personal service in the castle, the squire became in particular the
personal servant and bodyguard of the lord or knight. He was in a sense a
_valet_ for him, making his bed, caring for his clothes, helping him to
dress, and looking after him at night and when sick. He also groomed his
horse, looked after his weapons, and attended and protected him on the
field of combat or in battle. He himself learned to hunt, to handle shield
and spear, to ride in armor, to meet his opponent, and to fight with sword
and battle-axe. As he approached the age of twenty-one, he chose his lady-
love, who was older than he and who might be married, to whom he swore
ever to be devoted, even though he married some one else. He also learned
to rhyme, [18] to make songs, sing, dance, play the harp, and observe the
ceremonials of the Church. Girls were given this instruction along with
the boys, but naturally their training placed its emphasis upon household
duties, service, good manners, conversational ability, music, and
religion.

3. _Knight._ At twenty-one the boy was knighted, and of this the Church
made an impressive ceremonial. After fasting, confession, a night of vigil
in armor spent at the altar in holy meditation, and communion in the
morning, the ceremony of dubbing the squire a knight took place in the
presence of the court. He gave his sword to the priest, who blest it upon
the altar. He then took the oath "to defend the Church, to attack the
wicked, to respect the priesthood, to protect women and the poor, to
preserve the country in tranquillity, and to shed his blood, even to its
last drop, in behalf of his brethren." The priest then returned him the
sword which he had blessed, charging him "to protect the widows and
orphans, to restore and preserve the desolate, to revenge the wronged, and
to confirm the virtuous." He then knelt before his lord, who, drawing his
own sword and holding it over him, said: "In the name of God, of our Lady,
of thy patron Saint, and of Saint Michael and Saint George, I dub thee
knight; be brave (touching him with the sword on one shoulder), be bold
(on the other shoulder), be loyal (on the head)."

[Illustration: FIG. 48. A SQUIRE BEING KNIGHTED (From an old manuscript)]

THE CHIVALRIC IDEALS. Such, briefly stated, was the education of chivalry.
The cathedral and monastery schools not meeting the needs of the nobility,
the castle school was evolved. There was little that was intellectual
about the training given--few books, and no training in Latin. Instead,
the native language was emphasized, and squires in England frequently
learned to speak French. It was essentially an education for secular ends,
and prepared not only for active participation in the feuds and warfare of
the time, but also for the Seven Perfections of the Middle Ages: (1)
Riding, (2) Swimming, (3) Archery, (4) Fencing, (5) Hunting, (6) Whist or
Chess, and (7) Rhyming. It also represents the first type of schooling in
the Middle Ages designed to prepare for life here, rather than hereafter.
For the nobility it was a discipline, just as the Seven Liberal Arts was a
discipline for the monks and clergy. Out of it later on was evolved the
education of a gentleman as distinct from that of a scholar.

That such training had a civilizing effect on the nobility of the time
cannot be doubted. Through it the Church exercised a restraining and
civilizing influence on a rude, quarrelsome, and impetuous people, who
resented restraints and who had no use for intellectual discipline. It
developed the ability to work together for common ends, personal loyalty,
and a sense of honor in an age when these were much-needed traits, and the
ideal of a life of regulated service in place of one of lawless
gratification was set up. What monasticism had done for the religious life
in dignifying labor and service, chivalry did for secular life. The Ten
Commandments of chivalry, (1) to pray, (2) to avoid sin, (3) to defend the
Church, (4) to protect widows and orphans, (5) to travel, (6) to wage
loyal war, (7) to fight for his Lady, (8) to defend the right, (9) to love
his God, and (10) to listen to good and true men, while not often
followed, were valuable precepts to uphold in that age and time. In the
great Crusades movement of the twelfth century the Church consecrated the
military prowess and restless energy of the nobility to her service, but
after this wave had passed chivalry became formal and stilted and rapidly
declined in importance (R. 80).

4. _Professional study_

As the one professional study of the entire early Middle-Age period, and
the one study which absorbed the intellectual energy of the one learned
class, the evolution of the study of Theology possesses particular
interest for us.

THE STUDY OF THEOLOGY. During the earlier part of the period under
consideration the preparatory study necessary for service in the Church
was small, and very elementary in character. The elements of reading,
writing, reckoning, and music, as taught to _oblati_ in the monasteries,
sufficed. As knowledge increased a little the study of grammar at first,
and later all the studies of the _Trivium_ came to be common as
preparatory study, while those who made the best preparation added the
subjects of the _Quadrivium_. Ethics, or metaphysics, taught largely from
the digest of Aristotle's _Ethics_ prepared in the sixth century by
Boethius, was the text for this study until about 1200, when Aristotle's
_Metaphysics_, _Physics_, _Psychology_, and _Ethics_ were re-introduced
into Europe from Saracen sources (R. 87).

The theological course proper experienced a similar development. At first,
as we saw in chapter V, there were but few principles of belief, and the
church organization was exceedingly simple. In 325 A.D. the Nicene Creed
was formulated (p. 96), and the first twenty canons (rules) adopted for
the government of the clergy. With the translation of the Bible into the
Latin language (_Vulgate_, fourth century), the writings of the early
Latin Fathers, and additional canons and expressions of belief adopted at
subsequent church councils, an increasing amount relating to belief,
church organization, and pastoral duties needed to be imparted to new
members of the clergy. Still, up to the eleventh century at least, the
theological course remained quite meager. In a tenth-century account the
following description of the theological course of the time is given: [19]

     1. Elements of grammar and the first part of Donatus.
     2. Repeated readings of the Old and New Testaments.
     3. Mass prayers.
     4. Rules of the Church as to time reckoning.
     5. Decrees of the Church Councils.
     6. Rules of penance.
     7. Prescriptions for church services.
     8. Worldly laws.
     9. Collections of homilies (sermons).
    10. Tractates on the Epistles and Gospels.
    11. Lives of the Saints.
    12. Church music.

It will be seen from this tenth-century course of theological study that
it was based on reading, writing, and reckoning, and a little music as
preparatory studies; that it began with the first of the subjects of the
_Trivium_, which was studied only in part; and that its purpose was to
impart needed information as to dogma, church practices, canon (church)
law, and such civil (worldly) law as would be needed by the priest in
discharging his functions as the notary and lawyer of the age. There is no
suggestion of the study of Theology as a science, based on evidences,
logic, and ethics. Such study was not then known, and would not have been
tolerated. There were no other professions to study for.

SYSTEMATIC INSTRUCTION BEGINS. About 1145 Peter the Lombard published his
_Book of Sentences_, and this worked a revolution in the teaching of the
subject. In topics, arrangement, and method of treatment the book marked a
great advance, and became the standard textbook in Theology for a long
time. It did much to change the study of Theology from dogmas to a
scientific subject, and made possible schools of Theology in the
universities now about to arise. In the thirteenth century it was made the
official textbook at both the universities of Oxford and Paris. The
studies of dialectic and ethics were raised to a new plane of importance
by the publication of this book.

By the close of the twelfth century the interest of the Church in a
better-trained clergy had grown to such an extent that theological
instruction was ordered established wherever there was an Archbishop. In a
decree issued by Pope Innocent III and the General Council it was ordered:

    In every cathedral or other church of sufficient means, a master ought
    to be elected by the prelate or chapter, and the income of a prebend
    assigned to him, and in every metropolitan church a theologian also
    ought to be elected. And if the church is not rich enough to provide a
    grammarian and a theologian, it shall provide for the theologian from
    the revenues of his church, and cause provision to be made for the
    grammarian in some church of his city or diocese. [20]

We also, in the early thirteenth century, find bishops enforcing
theological training on future priests by orders of which the following is
a type:

    Hugh of Scawby, clerk, presented by Nigel Costentin to the church of
    (Potter) Hanworth, was admitted and canonically instituted in it as
    parson, on condition that he comes to the next orders to be ordained
    subdeacon. But on account of the insufficiency of his grammar, the
    lord bishop ordered him on pain of loss of his benefice to attend
    school. And the Dean of Wyville was ordered to induct him into
    corporal possession of the said church in form aforesaid, and to
    inform the lord bishop if he does not attend school. [21]


5. _Characteristics of mediaeval education_

FOUNDATIONS LAID FOR A NEW ORDER. The education which we have just
described covers the period from the time of the downfall of Rome to the
twelfth or the thirteenth century. It represents what the Church evolved
to replace that which it and the barbarians had destroyed. Meager as it
still was, after seven or eight centuries of effort, it nevertheless
presents certain clearly marked lines of development. The beginnings of a
new Christian civilization among the tribes which had invaded and overrun
the old Roman Empire are evident, and, toward the latter part of the
Middle Ages, we note the development of a number of centers of learning
(R. 71) and the beginnings of that specialization of knowledge (church
doctrine, classical learning, music, logic and ethics, theology), at
different church and monastery schools, which promised much for the future
of learning. We also notice, and will see the same evidence in the
following chapter, the beginnings of a class of scholarly men, though the
scholarship is very limited in scope and along lines thoroughly approved
by the Church.

In education proper, in the sense that we understand it, the schools
provided were still for a very limited class, and secondary rather than
elementary in nature. They were intended to meet the needs of an
institution rather than of a people, and to prepare those who studied in
them for service to that institution. That institution, too, had
concentrated its efforts on preparing its members for life in another
world, and not for life or service in this. There were as yet no
independent schools or scholars, the monks and clergy represented the one
learned class, Theology was the one professional study, the ability to
read and write was not regarded by noble or commoner as of any particular
importance, and all book knowledge was in a language which the people did
not understand when they heard it and could not read. Society was as yet
composed of three classes--feudal warriors, who spent their time in
amusements or fighting, and who had evolved a form of knightly training
for their children; privileged priests and monks and nuns, who controlled
all book learning and opportunities for professional advancement; and the
great mass of working peasants, engaged chiefly in agriculture, and
belonging to and helping to fight the battles of their protecting lord.

For these peasants there was as yet no education aside from what the
Church gave through her watchful oversight and her religious services (R.
81), and but little leisure, freedom, wealth, security, or economic need
to make such education possible or desirable. Moreover, the other-worldly
attitude of the Church made such education seem unnecessary. It was still
the education of a few for institutional purposes, though here and there,
by the close of the twelfth century, the Church was beginning to urge its
members to provide some education for their children (R. 82), and the
world was at last getting ready for the evolution of the independent
scholar, and soon would be ready for the evolution of schools to meet
secular needs.

REPRESSIVE ATTITUDE OF THE MEDIAEVAL CHURCH. The great work of the Church
during this period, as we see it to-day, was to assimilate and
sufficiently civilize the barbarians to make possible a new civilization,
based on knowledge and reason rather than force. To this end the Church
had interposed her authority against barbarian force, and had slowly won
the contest. Almost of necessity the Church had been compelled to insist
upon her way, and this type of absolutism in church government had been
extended to most other matters. The Bible, or rather the interpretations
of it which church councils, popes, bishops, and theological writers had
made, became authoritative, and disobedience or doubt became sinful in the
eyes of the Church. [22] The Scriptures were made the authority for
everything, and interpretations the most fantastic were made of scriptural
verses. Unquestioning belief was extended to many other matters, with the
result that tales the most wonderful were recounted and believed. To
question, to doubt, to disbelieve--these were among the deadly sins of the
early Middle Ages. This attitude of mind undoubtedly had its value in
assimilating and civilizing the barbarians, and probably was a necessity
at the time, but it was bad for the future of the Church as an
institution, and utterly opposed to scientific inquiry and intellectual
progress. Monroe well expresses the situation which came to exist when he
says:

    The validity of any statement, the actuality of any alleged instance,
    came to be determined, not by any application of rationalistic
    principle, not by inherent plausibility, not by actual inquiry into
    the facts of the case, but by its agreement with religious feelings or
    beliefs, its effect in furthering the influence of the Church or the
    reputation of a saint--in general, by its relationship to matters of
    faith. Thus it happens that the chronicles of the monks and the lives
    of the saints, charming and interesting as they are in their naïveté,
    their simplicity, their trustful credulity, and their pictures of a
    life and an attitude of mind so remote from ours, are filled with
    incidents given as facts that test the greatest faith, strain the most
    vivid imagination, and shock that innate respect for reality, that it
    is the purpose of modern education to inculcate. [23]

This authoritative and repressive attitude of the Church expressed itself
in many ways. The teaching of the period is an excellent example of this
influence. The instruction in the so-called Seven Liberal Arts remained
unchanged throughout a period of half a dozen centuries--so much
accumulated knowledge passed on as a legacy to succeeding generations. It
represented mere instruction; not education. As a recent writer has well
expressed it, the whole knowledge and culture contained in the Seven
Liberal Arts remained "like a substance in suspension in a medium
incapable of absorbing it; unchanged throughout the whole mediaeval
period." Inquiry or doubt in religious matters was not tolerated, and
scientific inquiry and investigation ceased to exist. The notable
scientific advances of the Greeks, their literature and philosophy, and
particularly their genius for free inquiry and investigation, no longer
influenced a world dominated by an institution preparing its children only
for life in a world to come. Not until the world could shake off this
mediaeval attitude toward scientific inquiry and make possible honest
doubt was any real intellectual progress possible. In a rough, general way
the turn in the tide came about the beginning of the twelfth century, and
for the next five centuries the Church was increasingly busy trying, like
King Canute of old, to stop the waves of free inquiry and scientific doubt
from rising higher against the bulwarks it had erected.

THE MEDIAEVAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. The educational system which the Church
had developed by 1200 continued unchanged in its essential features until
after the great awakening known as the Revival of Learning, or
Renaissance. This system we have just sketched. For instruction in the
elements of learning we have the inner and outer monastery and convent
schools, and, in connection with the churches, song schools, and chantry
or stipendary schools. In these last we have the beginnings of the parish
school for instruction in the elements of learning and the fundamentals of
faith for the children of the faithful. In the monasteries, convents, and
in connection with the cathedral churches we have the secondary
instruction fairly well organized with the _Trivium_ and the _Quadrivium_
as the basis. At the close of the period under consideration in this
chapter a few privately endowed grammar schools were just beginning to be
founded to supplement the work of the cathedral schools (RS. 141-143). In
some of the inner monastery schools and a few of the cathedral schools we
also have the beginnings of higher instruction, with theology as the one
professional subject and the one learned career.

[Illustration: FIG. 50. EVOLUTION OF EDUCATION DURING THE EARLY MIDDLE
AGES
The relative weight of the lines indicates approximate development. The
lines along which educational evolution took place in the later Middle
Ages are here clearly marked out.]

All these schools, too, were completely under the control of the Church.
There were no private schools or teachers before about 1200. Only the
chivalric education was under the control of princes or kings, and even
this the Church kept under its supervision. The Church was still the
State, to a large degree, and the Church, unlike Greece or Rome, took the
education of the young upon itself as one of its most important functions.
The schools taught what the Church approved, and the instruction was for
religious and church ends. The monks who gave instruction in the
monasteries were responsible to the Abbot, who was in turn responsible to
the head of the order and through him to the Pope at Rome. Similarly the
_scholasticus_ in the cathedral school and the _precentor_ in the song
school were both responsible to the Bishop, and again through Archbishop
and Cardinal to the Pope.

THE FIRST TEACHER'S CERTIFICATES AND SCHOOL SUPERVISION. Toward the latter
part of the period under consideration in this chapter an interesting
development in church school administration took place. As the cathedral
and song schools increased assistant teachers were needed, and the
_scholasticus_ and _precentor_ gradually withdrew from instruction and
became the supervisors of instruction, or rather the principals of their
respective schools. As song or parish schools were established in the
parishes of the diocese teachers for these were needed, and the
_scholasticus_ and _precentor_ extended their authority and supervision
over these, just as the Bishop had done much earlier (p. 97) over the
training and appointment of priests. By 1150 we have, clearly evolved, the
system of central supervision of the training of all teachers in the
diocese through the issuing, for the first time in Europe, of licenses to
teach (R. 83). The system was finally put into legal form by a decree
adopted by a general council of the Church at Rome, in 1179, which
required that the _scholasticus_ "should have authority to superintend all
the schoolmasters of the diocese and grant them licenses without which
none should presume to teach," and that "nothing be exacted for licenses
to teach" issued by him, thus stopping the charging of fees for their
issuance. The _precentor_, in a similar manner, claimed and often secured
supervision of all elementary, and especially all song-school instruction.
Teachers were also required to take an oath of fealty and obedience (R. 84
b).

As a result of centuries of evolution we thus find, by 1200, a limited but
powerful church school system, with centralized control and supervision of
instruction, diocesan licenses to teach, and a curriculum adapted to the
needs of the institution in control of the schools. We also note the
beginnings of secular instruction in the training of the nobility for
life's service, though even this is approved and sanctioned by the Church.
The centralized religious control thus established continued until the
nineteenth century, and still exists to a more or less important degree in
the school systems of Italy, the old Austro-Hungarian States, Germany,
England, and some other western nations. As we shall see later on, one of
the big battles in the process of developing state school systems has come
through the attempt of the State to substitute its own organization for
this religious monopoly of instruction.

QUESTIONS ON THE READINGS

1. Distinguish between song and grammar schools (70), and state what was
taught in each. Do we have any modern analogy to the same teacher teaching
both schools, as was sometimes done?

2. Distinguish between monastic and episcopal (cathedral) schools (71).
When was the great era of each? How do you explain the change in relative
importance of the two?

3. Explain the process of evolution of a parish school out of a chantry
school.

4. What was the nature of the cathedral school at Salisbury (72)?

5. What type of a school was provided for in the Aldwincle chantry (73)?
Using, now one, now the other of these two pairs of eyes, he never
knows with which at the moment he is gazing, whether on the realities
or on the shadows, but always supposes what he sees at the moment
to be the realities, and calls them 'Things as They Are.'

Further, his lips have been touched with the glory of the greater
vision, and he speaks enchantingly when he discourses of the shadows
on the rock, thereby deepening the delusion of the other prisoners
whom his genius has played the crimp to, enticing them into the den
and hocussing and chaining them there.

For, seeing the shadows pass to the interpretation of such a voice,
they are satisfied that they indeed behold Things as They Are, and that
these are the only things worth knowing.

"The tragedy of it lies in this, that Mr. Kipling in his greater moments
cannot help but see that he, with every inspired singer, is by right
the prophet of a law and order compared with which all the majestic
law and order of the British Empire are but rags and trumpery:--"

"'I ha' harpit ye up to the throne o' God, I ha' harpit your midmost
soul in three; I ha' harpit ye down to the Hinges o' Hell,
And--ye--would--make--a Knight o' me!'"

"Not long ago an interviewer called on Mr. Meredith, and brought away
this for his pains:--
"'I suppose I should regard myself as getting old--I am seventy-four.

But I do not feel to be growing old either in heart or mind. I still
look on life with a young man's eye.
I have always hoped I should not grow old as some do--with a palsied intellect,
living backwards, regarding other people as anachronisms because
they themselves have lived on into other times, and left their
sympathies behind them with their years.'

"He never will.

He will always preserve the strength of manhood in his work because hope,
the salt of manhood, is the savour of all his philosophy. When I
think of his work as a whole--his novels and poems together--this
confession of his appears to me, not indeed to summarise it--for
it is far too multifarious and complex--but to say the first and
the last word upon it.

In poem and in novel he puts a solemnity of his own into the warning, _ne
tu pueri contempseris annos_.

He has never grown old, because his hopes are set on the young; and his
dearest wish, for those who can read beneath his printed word, is to
leave the world not worse, but so much the better as a man may,
for the generations to come after him.

To him this is 'the cry of the conscience of life':--"
"'Keep the young generations in hail, And bequeath them no tumbled house.'

"To him this is at once a duty and a 'sustainment supreme,' and
perhaps the bitterest words this master of Comedy has written are
for the seniors of the race who--
"'On their last plank, Pass mumbling it as nature's final page,'

"And cramp the young with their rules of 'wisdom,' lest, as he says
scornfully:--
"'Lest dreaded change, long dammed by dull decay, Should bring the
world a vessel steered by brain, And ancients musical at close of
day.'

"'Earth loves her young,' begins his next sonnet:--
"'Her gabbling grey she eyes askant, nor treads The ways they walk;
by what they speak oppressed.'

"But his conviction, if here for a moment
  it discharges gall, is usually cheerful with the cheerfulness
  of health. Sometimes he consciously
expounds it; oftener he leaves you
  to seek and find it, but always (I believe) you will find
    this happy hope in youth at the base of everything he
  writes.

  "The next thing to be noted is that he does not hope in
  youth because it is a period of license and waywardness, but because
  it is a period of imagination--

"'Days, when the ball of our vision Had eagles that flew unabashed
to sun,'
"And because it therefore has a better chance of grasping what is
Universal than has the prudential wisdom of age which contracts its
eye to particulars and keeps it alert for social pitfalls--the kind
of wisdom seen at its best (but its best never made a hero) in Bubb
Doddington's verses:--
"'Love thy country, wish it well, _Not with too intense a care_;
'Tis enough that, when it fell, Thou its ruin didst not share.'

"Admirable caution!

Now contrast it for a moment with, let us say, the silly quixotic
figure of Horatius with the broken bridge behind him:--
"'Round turned he, as not deigning Those craven ranks to see:
Nought spake he to Lars Porsena, To Sextus nought spake he; But he
saw on Palatinus The white porch of his home--'
"I protest I have no heart to go on with the quotation: so unpopular
is its author, just now, and so certainly its boyish heroism calls
back the boyish tears to my eyes.

Well, this boyish vision is what Mr. Meredith chooses to trust rather
than Bubb Doddington's, and he trusts it as being the likelier to apprehend
universal truths: he believes that Horatius with an army in front and a
broken bridge behind him was a nobler figure than Bubb Doddington wishing
his country well but not with too intense a care; and not only nobler
but--this is the point--more obedient to divine law, more expressive of
that which man was meant to be. If Mr. Meredith trusts youth, it is as
a time of imagination; and if he trusts imagination, it is as a faculty
for apprehending the Universal in life--that is to say, a divine
law behind its shows and simulacra.

"In 'The Empty Purse' you will find him instructing youth towards this
law; but that there may be no doubt of his own belief in it, as an
order not only controlling men but overriding angels and demons, first
consider his famous sonnet, 'Lucifer in Starlight'--to my thinking
one of the finest in our language:--
"'On a starred night Prince Lucifer uprose.
Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend Above the rolling ball in cloud
part screened, Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose.
Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.
And now upon his western wing he leaned, Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands
careened, Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.
Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars With memory of the
old revolt from Awe, He reached a middle height, and at the stars,
Which are the brain of Heaven, he looked, and sank.

Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank, The army of unalterable
law.'"

"Suppose my contention--that poetry should concern itself with universals--to
be admitted: suppose we all agreed that Poetry is an expression of
the universal element in human life, that (as Shelley puts it) 'a
poem is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth.'

There remains a question quite as important: and that is, How to recognise
the Universal when we see it? We may talk of a Divine law, or a Divine
order--call it what we will--which regulates the lives of us poor men no
less than the motions of the stars, and binds the whole universe, high and
low, into one system: and we may have arrived at the blessed wish to conform
with this law rather than to strive and kick against the pricks and
waste our short time in petulant rebellion. So far, so good: but how are
we to know the law? How, with the best will in the world, are we to
distinguish order from disorder? What assurance have we, after striving to
bring ourselves into obedience, that we have succeeded? We may agree, for
example, with Wordsworth that Duty is a stern daughter of the Voice
of God, and that through Duty 'the most ancient heavens,' no less
than we ourselves, are kept fresh and strong.

But can we always discern this Universal, this Duty? What is the criterion?
And what, when we have chosen, is the sanction of our choice?

"A number of honest people will promptly refer us to revealed
religion.
'Take (they say) your revealed religion on faith, and there you have the
law and the prophets, and your universals set out for you, and your
principles of conduct laid down. What more do you want?'
"To this I answer, 'We are human, and we need also the testimony of Poetry;
and the priceless value of poetry for us lies in this, that it does _not_
echo the Gospel like a parrot. If it did, it would be servile, superfluous.
It is ministerial and useful because it approaches truth by another
path.

It does not say ditto to Mr. Burke--it corroborates. And it corroborates
precisely because it does not say ditto, but employs a natural process of
its own which it employed before ever Christianity was revealed. You
may decide that religion is enough for you, and that you have no need of
poetry; but if you have any intelligent need of poetry it will be
because poetry, though it end in the same conclusions, reaches them
by another and separate path.

"Now (as I understand him) Mr. Meredith connects man with the
Universal, and teaches him to arrive at it and recognise it by
strongly reminding him that he is a child of Earth. 'You are amenable,'
he says in effect, 'to a law which all the firmament obeys. But in all
that firmament you are tied to one planet, which we call Earth. If
therefore you would apprehend the law, study your mother, Earth, which
also obeys it.

Search out her operations; honour your mother as legitimate children, and
let your honour be the highest you can pay--that of making yourself
docile to her teaching. So will you stand the best chance, the only
likely chance, of living in harmony with that Will which over-arches Earth
and us all.'
"In this doctrine Mr. Meredith believes passionately; so let there
be no mistake about the thoroughness with which he preaches it.
Even prayer, he tells us in one of his novels, is most useful when like a
fountain it falls back and draws refreshment from earth for a new spring
heavenward:--
"'And there vitality, there, there solely in song Besides, where earth and
her uses to men, their needs, Their forceful cravings, the theme are:
there is it strong, The Master said: and the studious eye that reads,
(Yea, even as earth to the crown of Gods on the mount), In links divine
with the lyrical tongue is bound.
Pursue thy craft: it is music drawn of the fount To spring perennial;
well-spring is common ground.'
"And it follows that to one who believes in the teaching of earth
so whole-heartedly earth is not a painted back-cloth for man to
strut against and attitudinise, but a birth-place from which he
cannot escape, and in relation with which he must be considered,
and must consider himself, on pain of becoming absurd.

Even:

"'His cry to heaven is a cry to her He would evade.'
"She is a stern mother, be it understood, no coddling one:--
"'He may entreat, aspire, He may despair, and she has never heed, She,
drinking his warm sweat, will soothe his need, Not his desire.'
"When we neglect or misread her lessons, she punishes; at the best, she
offers no fat rewards to the senses, but--
"'The sense of large charity over the land; Earth's wheaten of wisdom
dispensed in the rough, And a bell ringing thanks for a sustenance
meal.'
"('Lean fare,' as the poet observes; and unpalatable, for instance, to our
Members of Parliament, to whom our Mr.

Balfour one evening paid the highest compliment within their range
of apprehension by assuming that quite a large number of them could
write cheques for 69,000 pounds without inconvenience.)

At the best, too, she offers, with the loss of things we have desired,
a serene fortitude to endure their loss:--
"'Love born of knowledge, love that gains Vitality as Earth it
mates, The meaning of the Pleasures, Pains, The Life, the Death,
illuminates.

"'For love we Earth, then serve we all; Her mystic secret then is ours:

We fall, or view our treasures fall, Unclouded--as beholds her flowers

"'Earth, from a night of frosty wreck, Enrobed in morning's mounted fire,
When lowly, with a broken neck, The crocus lays her cheek to mire.'
"But at least it is the true milk for man that she distils--
"'From her heaved breast of sacred common mould';
"The breast (to quote from another poem)--
"'Which is his well of strength, his home of rest, And fair to scan.'
"And so Mr. Meredith, having diagnosed our disease, which is Self-- our
'distempered devil of Self,' gluttonous of its own enjoyments and
therefore necessarily a foe to law, which rests on temperance and
self-control--walks among men like his own wise physician, Melampus,
with eyes that search the book of Nature closely, as well for love
of her as to discover and extract her healing secrets.

"'With love exceeding a simple love of the things That glide in grasses
and rubble of woody wreck; Or change their perch on a beat of quivering
wings From branch to branch, only restful to pipe and peck; Or, bristled,
curl at a touch their snouts in a ball; Or cast their web between bramble
and thorny hook; The good physician Melampus, loving them all, Among
them walked, as a scholar who reads a book.

"'For him the woods were a home and gave him the key Of knowledge,
thirst for their treasures in herbs and flowers.
The secrets held by the creatures nearer than we To earth he sought, and
the link of their life with ours. . . .'
"Here by another road we come to a teaching which is also the Gospels':

that to apprehend the highest truth one must have a mind of extreme humility.
'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,' 'Neither shall
they say, Lo here! or Lo there! for behold the kingdom of God is within
you,' 'And He took a little child and set him in the midst of them,' &c.
Poetry cannot make these sayings any truer than they are, but it
can illuminate for us the depths of their truth, and so (be it
humbly said) can help their acceptance by man.

If they come down from heaven, derived from arguments too high for his ken,
poetry confirms them by arguments taken from his own earth, instructing him
the while to read it as--
"'An Earth alive with meanings, wherein meet Buried, and breathing, and
to be,'
"And teaching him, 'made lowly wise,' that the truth of the highest heavens
lies scattered about his feet.

"'Melampus dwelt among men, physician and sage, He served them, loving them,
healing them; sick or maimed, Or them that frenzied in some delirious rage
Outran the measure, his juice of the woods reclaimed.
He played on men, as his master Phoebus on strings Melodious: as the
God did he drive and check, Through love exceeding a simple love of
the things That glide in grasses and rubble of woody wreck.'
"I think, if we consider the essence of this teaching, we shall have no
difficulty now in understanding why Mr. Meredith's hopes harp so persistently
on the 'young generations,' why our duty to them is to him 'the cry
of the conscience of life,' or why, as he studies Earth, he maintains that--

"'Deepest at her springs, Most filial, is an eye to love her young.'"

"But Meredith, if a true poet, is also and undeniably a hard one: and a
poet must not only preach but persuade. 'He dooth not only show the
way,' says Sidney, 'but giveth so sweet a prospect into the way as will
intice any man to enter into it.'
"Here, my dear X, I lay hands on you and drag you in as the Conscientious
Objector. 'How?' you will ask.

'Is not the plain truth good enough for men?

And if poetry must win acceptance for her by beautiful adornments, alluring
images, captivating music, is there not something deceptive in the business,
even if it be not downright dishonest?' Well, I think you have
a right to be answered."
"Thank you," said X.

"And I don't think you are convincingly answered by Keats'--
"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty--that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye
need to know.'
"With all respect to the poet, we don't know it; and if we did it would
come a long way short of all we need to know. The Conscientious Objector
will none the less maintain that truth and beauty have never been recognised
as identical, and that, in practice, to employ their names as convertible
terms would lead to no end of confusion. I like the man (you will be
glad to hear), because on an important subject he will be satisfied with
nothing less than clear thinking.
The invasions and destruction of the Northmen had
at last ceased, the Mohammedan conquests were over, almost the last of the
Germanic tribes in Europe had settled down and had accepted Christianity,
[8] and the fighting nobility of Europe were being held somewhat in
restraint by the might of the Church, the "Truce of God" (R. 79), and the
softening influence of chivalric education (R. 80). There were many
evidences, too, by the end of the eleventh century, that the western
Christian world, after the long intellectual night, was soon to awaken to
a new intellectual life. The twelfth century, in particular, was a period
when it was evident that some new leaven was at work.

Up to about the close of the eleventh century western Europe had been
living in an age of simple faith. The Christian world everywhere lay under
"a veil of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession." The mysteries of
Christianity and the many inconsistencies of its teachings and beliefs
were accepted with childlike docility, and the Church had felt little call
to organize, to systematize, or to explain. Here and there, to be sure,
some questioning monk or cleric had raised questions over matters [9] of
faith which his reason could not explain, and had, perhaps, for a time
disturbed the peace of orthodoxy, but a statement somewhat similar to that
made by Anselm of Canterbury (footnote, p. 173), as to the precedence of
faith over reason, had usually been sufficient to silence all inquiry.
Once, in the latter part of the eleventh century, when a great discussion
as to the nature of knowledge had taken place among the leaders of the
Church, a church council had been called to pass upon and give final
settlement to the questions raised. [10]

RISE OF THE SPIRIT OF INQUIRY. As the cathedral schools grew in importance
as teaching institutions, and came to have many teachers and students, a
few of them became noted as places where good instruction was imparted and
great teachers were to be found. Canterbury in England, Paris and Chartres
in France, and several of the cities in northern Italy early were noted
for the quality of their instruction. The great teachers and the keenest
students of the time were to be found in the cathedral schools in these
places, and the monastic schools now lost their earlier importance as
teaching institutions. By the twelfth century they had been completely
superseded as important teaching centers by the rapidly developing
cathedral schools. To these more important cathedral schools students now
came from long distances to study under some noted teacher. Says McCabe:
[11]

    The scholastic fever which was soon to influence the youth of Europe,
    had already set in. You could not travel far over the rough roads of
    France without meeting some footsore scholar, making for the nearest
    large monastery or cathedral town. Robbers, frequently in the service
    of the lord of the land, infested every province. It was safest to don
    the coarse frieze tunic of the pilgrim, without pockets, sling your
    little wax tablets and stylus at your girdle, strap a wallet of bread
    and herbs and salt on your back, and laugh at the nervous folk who
    peeped out from their coaches over a hedge of pikes and daggers. Few
    monasteries refused a meal or a rough bed to the wandering scholar.
    Rarely was any fee exacted for the lesson given.

The cathedral school in connection with the church of Notre Dame [12]
became especially famous for its teachers of the Liberal Arts
(particularly Dialectic) and of Theology, and to this school, just as the
eleventh century was drawing to a close, came a youth, then barely twenty
years of age, who is generally regarded as having been the keenest scholar
of the twelfth century. His brilliant intellect soon enabled him to refute
the instruction of his teachers and to vanquish them in debate. His name
was Abelard. Before long he himself became a teacher of Grammar and Logic
at Paris, and later of Theology, and, so widely had he read, so clearly
did he appeal to the reason of his hearers, and so incisive was his
teaching, that he attracted large numbers of students to his lectures. To
assist in his teaching of Theology he prepared a little textbook, _Sic et
Non_ (Yea and Nay), in which he raised for debate many questions as to
church teachings (R. 91 b), such as "That faith is based on reason, or
not." In the introduction to this textbook he held that "constant and
frequent questioning is the first key to wisdom" (R. 91 a). His method was
to give the authorities on both sides, but to render no decision. His
boldness in raising such questions for debate was new, and his failure to
give the students a decision was quite unusual, while his claim that
reason was antecedent to faith was startling. Even after being driven from
Paris, in part because of this boldness and in part because of a most
unfortunate incident which deservedly ruined his career in the Church,
students in numbers followed him to his retreat and listened to his
teachings. His method of instruction was for the time so unusual and his
spirit of inquiry so searching that he stimulated many a young mind to a
new type of thinking. One of his pupils was Peter the Lombard (p. 171),
who completely redirected the teaching of theology with his _Book of
Sentences_ (c. 1145)--This was based largely on Abelard's method, except
that a positive and orthodox decision was presented for each question
raised.

[Illustration: FIG. 53. THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME, AT PARIS
The present cathedral was begun in 1163, consecrated in 1182, and
completed in the thirteenth century. It is built on an island in the
Seine, and on the site of a church built in the fourth century. The little
community which grew up about the cathedral church formed the nucleus
about which the city of Paris eventually grew. This cathedral front, with
its statues and beautiful carving, formed a type much followed during the
great period of cathedral-building (thirteenth century) in Europe. The
school in connection with this cathedral early became famous.]

What took place at Paris also took place, though generally on a smaller
scale, at many other cathedral and monastery schools of western Europe.
The spirit of inquiry had at last been awakened, the Church was being
respectfully challenged by its children to prove its faith, and the
learning of the Saracens in Spain, which now began to filter across the
Pyrenees, added to the strength of their challenge. Returning pilgrims and
crusaders (First Crusade, 1099) also began to ask for an explanation of
the doubts which had come to them from the contact with Greek and Arab in
the East. Produced from page scans provided by Internet Archive and University

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

BY CHARLES FOLLEN.
This little book is dedicated to parents and children. Most of the
poems were written with no other hope, than that they would instruct
or please some child.With the new emphasis now placed on reasoning, Dialectic or Logic
superseded Grammar as the great subject of study, and logical analysis was
now applied to the problems of religion. The Church adopted and guided the
movement, and the schools of the time turned their energy into directions
approved by it. Aristotle also was in time adopted by the Church, after
the translation of his principal works had been effected (Rs. 87, 90), and
his philosophy was made a bulwark for Christian doctrine throughout the
remainder of the Middle Ages. For the next four centuries Aristotle
thoroughly dominated all philosophic thinking. [14] The great development
and use of logical analysis now produced many keen and subtle minds, who
worked intensively a narrow and limited field of thought. The result was a
thorough reorganization and restatement of the theology of the Church.

[Illustration: PLATE 3. SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS]

This was the work of Scholasticism. The movement was not characterized by
the evolution of new doctrines, but by a systematization and organization
into good teaching form of what had grown up during the preceding thousand
years. To a large degree it was also an "accommodation" of the old
theology to the new Aristotelian philosophy which had recently been
brought back to western Europe, and the statement of the Christian
doctrines in good philosophic form.

THE ORGANIZING WORK OF THE SCHOOLMEN. Peter the Lombard (1100-1160), whose
_Book of Sentences_, mentioned above, had so completely changed the
character of the instruction in Theology, began this work of theological
reorganization. Albert the Great (_Albertus Magnus_, 1193-1280) was the
first of the great Schoolmen, and has been termed "the organizing
intellect of the Middle Ages." He was a German Dominican monk [15], born
in Swabia, and educated in the schools of Paris, Padua, and Bologna. Later
he became a celebrated teacher at Paris and Cologne. He was the first to
state the philosophy of Aristotle in systematic form, and was noted as an
exponent of the work of Peter the Lombard. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274),
the greatest and most influential scholastic philosopher of the Middle
Ages, studied first at Monte Cassino and Naples, and then at Paris and
Cologne, under Albertus Magnus. He later became a noted teacher of
Philosophy and Theology at Rome, Bologna, Viterbo, Perugia, and Naples.
Under him Scholasticism came to its highest development in his harmonizing
the new Aristotelianism with the doctrines of the Church. His class
teaching was based on Aristotle, [16] the Vulgate Bible, and Peter the
Lombard's _Book of Sentences_. During the last three years of his life he
wrote his _Summa Theologiae_, a book which has ever since been accepted as
an authoritative statement of the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.

The character of the organization made by Peter the Lombard and Thomas
Aquinas may be seen from an examination of their method of presentation,
which was dogmatic in form and similar in the textbooks of each. The field
of Christian Theology was divided out into parts, heads, subheads, etc.,
in a way that would cover the subject, and a group of problems, each
dealing with some doctrinal point, was then presented under each. The
problem was first stated in the text. Next the authorities and arguments
for each solution other than that considered as orthodox were presented
and confuted, in order. The orthodox solution was next presented, the
arguments and authorities for such solution quoted, and the objections to
the correct solution presented and refuted (R. 152).

RESULTS OF THEIR WORK. The work of the Schoolmen was to organize and
present in systematic and dogmatic form the teachings of the Church (R.
92). This they did exceedingly well, and the result was a thorough
organization of Theology as a teaching subject. They did little to extend
knowledge, and nothing at all to apply it to the problems of nature and
man. Their work was abstract and philosophical instead, dealing wholly
with theological questions. The purpose was to lay down principles, and to
offer a training in analysis, comparison, classification, and deduction
which would prepare learned and subtle defenders of the faith of the
Church. So successful were the Schoolmen in their efforts that instruction
in Theology was raised by their work to a new position of importance, and
a new interest in theological scholarship and general learning was
awakened which helped not a little to deflect many strong spirits from a
life of warfare to a life of study. They made the problems of learning
seem much more worth while, and their work helped to create a more
tolerant attitude toward the supporters of either side of debatable
questions by revealing so clearly that there are two sides to every
question. This new learning, new interest in learning, and new spirit of
tolerance the rising universities inherited.


III. LAW AND MEDICINE AS NEW STUDIES

THE OLD ROMAN CITIES. The old Roman Empire, it will be remembered, came to
be largely a collection of provincial cities. These were the centers of
Roman civilization and culture. After the downfall of the governing power
of Rome, the great highways were no longer repaired, brigandage became
common, trade and intercourse largely ceased, and the provincial cities
which were not destroyed in the barbarian invasions declined in population
and number, passing under the control of their bishops who long ruled them
as feudal lords. During the long period of disorder many of the old Roman
cities entirely disappeared (R. 49). Only in Italy, and particularly in
northern Italy, did these old cities retain anything of their earlier
municipal life, or anything worth mentioning of their former industry and
commerce. But even here they lost most of their earlier importance as
centers of culture and trade, becoming merely ecclesiastical towns. After
the death of Charlemagne, the break-up of his empire, and the institution
of feudal conditions, the cities and towns declined still more in
importance, and few of any size remained.

In Italy feudalism never attained the strength it did in northern Europe.
Throughout all the early Middle Ages the cities there retained something
of their old privileges, though ruled by prince-bishops residing in them.
They also retained something of the old Roman civilization, and Roman
legal usages and some knowledge of Roman law never quite died out. In
other respects they much resembled mediaeval cities elsewhere.

REESTABLISHMENT OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. After the disintegration of
Charlemagne's empire, the portion of it now known as Germany broke up into
fragments, largely independent of one another, and full of fight and
pride. The result there was continual and pitiless warfare. This, coupled
with the raids of the Northmen along the northern coast and the Magyars on
the east, led to the election of a king in 919 (Henry the Fowler) who
could establish some semblance of unity and order. By 961 the German
duchies and small principalities had been so consolidated that a
succeeding king (Otto I) felt himself able to attempt to reëstablish the
Holy Roman Empire by subjugating Italy and annexing it as an appendage
under German rule.

He descended into Italy (961), subjugated the cities, overthrew the
Papacy, created a pope to his liking, and reëstablished the old Empire, in
name at least. For a century the German rule was nominal, but with the
outbreak of the conflict in the eleventh century between king and pope
over the question of which one should invest the bishops with their
authority (known as the _investiture conflict_, 1075-1122), Pope Gregory
VII humbled the German king (Henry IV) at Canossa (1077) and won a partial
success. Then followed repeated invasions of Italy, and a century and a
half of conflicts between pope and king before the dream of universal
empire under a German feudal king ended in disaster, and Italy was freed
from Teutonic rule.

[Illustration: FIG. 54, THE CITY-STATES OF NORTHERN ITALY
All of the cities in the valley of the Po, except Turin, Pavia, and
Mantua, were members of the Lombard League of 1167.]

THE ITALIAN CITIES REVIVE THE STUDY OF ROMAN LAW. As was stated above,
Roman legal usages and some knowledge of Roman law had never quite died
out in these Italian cities. But, while regarded with reverence, the law
was not much understood, little study was given to it, and important parts
of it were neglected and forgotten. The struggle with the ruling bishops
in the second half of the eleventh century, and the discussions which
arose during the investiture conflict, caused new attention to be given to
legal questions, and both the study of Roman (civil) and Church (canon)
law were revived. The Italian cities stood with the Papacy in the
struggles with the German kings, and, in 1167, those in the Valley of the
Po formed what was known as the _Lombard League_ for defense. Under the
pressure of German oppression they now began a careful study of the known
Roman law in an effort to discover some charter, edict, or grant of power
upon which they could base their claim for independent legal rights. The
result was that the study of Roman law was given an emphasis unknown in
Italy since the days of the old Empire. What had been preserved during the
period of disorder at last came to be understood, additional books of the
law were discovered, and men suddenly awoke to a realization that what had
been before considered as of little value actually contained much that was
worth studying, as well as many principles of importance that were
applicable to the conditions and problems of the time.

[Illustration: FIG. 55. FRAGMENT FROM THE RECOVERED "DIGEST" OF JUSTINIAN
Capitals and small letters are here used, but note the difficulty of
reading without spacing or punctuation.]

The great student and teacher of law of the period was Irnerius of Bologna
(c. 1070-1137), who began to lecture on the _Code_ and the _Institutes_ of
Justinian about 1110 to 1115, and soon attracted large numbers of students
to hear his interpretations. About this same time the _Digest_, much the
largest and most important part of the old law, was discovered and made
known. [17]

This gave clearness to the whole, as before its discovery the study of
Roman law was like the study of Aristotle when only parts of the _Organon_
were known. Irnerius and his co-laborers at Bologna now collected and
arranged the entire body of Roman civil law (_Corpus Juris Civilis_) (R.
93), introduced the _Digest_ to western Europe, and thus made a new
contribution of first importance to the list of possible higher studies.
Law now ceased to be a part of Rhetoric (p. 157) and became a new subject
of study, with a body of material large enough to occupy a student for
several years. This was an event of great intellectual significance. A new
study was now evolved which offered great possibilities for intellectual
activity and the exercise of the critical faculty, while at the same time
showing veneration for authority. Law was thus placed alongside Theology
as a professional subject, and the evolution of the professional lawyer
from the priest was now for the first time made possible.

CANON LAW ALSO ORGANIZED AS A SUBJECT OF STUDY. Inspired by the revival of
the study of civil law, a monk of Bologna, Gratian by name, set himself to
make a compilation of all the Church canons which had been enacted since
the Council of Nicaea (325) formulated the first twenty (p. 96), and of
the rules for church government as laid down by the church authorities.
This he issued in textbook form, about 1142, under the title of _Decretum
Gratiani_. So successful were his efforts that his compilation was "one of
those great textbooks that take the world by storm." It did for canon
(church) law what the rediscovery of the Justinian _Code_ had done for
civil law; that is, it organized canon law as a new and important teaching
subject.

The _Decretum_ of Gratian was published in three parts, and was organized
after the same plan as Abelard's _Sic et Non_, except that Gratian drew
conclusions from the mass of evidence he presented on each topic. It
contained 147 "Distinctions" (questions; cases of church policy), upon
each of which were cited the church canons and the views and decisions of
important church authorities. [18] This volume was added to by popes later
on, [19] so that by the fifteenth century a large body of canon law had
grown up, which was known as the _Corpus Juris Canonici_. Canon Law was
thus separated from Theology and added to Civil Law as another new subject
of study for both theological and legal students, and the two subjects of
Canon and Civil Law came to constitute the work of the law faculties in
the universities which soon arose in western Europe.

[Illustration: FIG. 56. THE FATHER OF MEDICINE HIPPOCRATES OF COS (460-
367? B.C.)]

THE BEGINNINGS OF MEDICAL STUDY. The Greeks had made some progress in the
beginnings of the study of disease (p. 47). Aristotle had given some
anatomical knowledge in his writings on animals, and had theorized a
little about the functions of the human body. The real founder of medical
science, though, was Hippocrates, of the island of Cos (c. 460-367 B.C.),
a contemporary of Plato. He was the first writer on the subject who
attempted to base the practice of the healing art on careful observation
and scientific principles. He substituted scientific reason for the wrath
of offended deities as the causes of disease, and tried to offer proper
remedies in place of sacrifices and prayers to the gods for cures. His
descriptions of diseases were wonderfully accurate, and his treatments
ruled medical practice for ages. [20] He knew, however, little as to
anatomy. Another Greek writer, Galen [21](131-201 A.D.), wrote extensively
on medicine and left an anatomical account of the human body which was
unsurpassed for more than a thousand years. His work was known and used by
the Saracens. Avicenna (980-1037), an eastern Mohammedan, wrote a _Canon
of Medicine_ in which he summarized the work of all earlier writers, and
gave a more minute description of symptoms than any preceding writer had
done. These works, together with a few minor writings by teachers in Spain
and Salerno, formed the basis of all medical knowledge until Vesalius
published his _System of Human Anatomy_, in 1543.

The Roman knowledge of medicine was based almost entirely on that of the
Greeks, and after the rise of the Christians, with their new attitude
toward earthly life and contempt for the human body, the science fell into
disrepute and decay. Saint Augustine (354-430), in his great work on _The
City of God_, speaks with some bitterness of "medical men who are called
anatomists," and who "with a cruel zeal for science have dissected the
bodies of the dead, and sometimes of sick persons, who have died under
their knives, and have inhumanly pried into the secrets of the human body
to learn the nature of disease and its exact seat, and how it might be
cured." [22] During the early Middle Ages the Greek medical knowledge
practically disappeared, and in its place came the Christian theories of
satanic influence, diabolic action, and divine punishment for sin.
Correspondingly the cures were prayers at shrines and repositories of
sacred relics and images, which were found all over Europe, and to which
the injured or fever-stricken peasants hied themselves to make offerings
and to pray, and then hope for a miracle.

Toward the middle of the eleventh century Salerno, a small city
delightfully situated on the Italian coast (see Map, p. 194), thirty-four
miles south of Naples, began to attain some reputation as a health resort.
In part this was due to the climate and in part to its mineral springs.
Southern Italy had, more than any other part of western Europe, retained
touch with old Greek thought. The works of Hippocrates and Galen had been
preserved there, the monks at Monte Cassino had made some translations,
and sometime toward the middle of the eleventh century the study of the
Greek medical books was revived here. The Mohammedan medical work by
Avicenna (p. 185), also early became known here in translation. About 1065
Constantine of Carthage, a converted Jew and a learned monk, who had
traveled extensively in the East [23] and who had been forced to flee from
his native city because of a suspicion of "black art," began to lecture at
Salerno on the Greek and Mohammedan medical works and the practice of the
medical art. In 1099 Robert, Duke of Normandy, returning from the First
Crusade, stopped here to be cured of a wound, and he and his knights later
spread the fame of Salerno all over Europe. The result was the revival of
the study of Medicine in the West, and Salerno developed into the first of
the medical schools of Europe. Montpellier, in southern France, also
became another early center for the study of Medicine, drawing much of its
medical knowledge from Spain. Another new subject of professional study
was now made possible, and Faculties of Medicine were in time organized in
most of the universities as they arose. The instruction, though, was
chiefly book instruction, Galen being the great textbook until the
seventeenth century.


IV. OTHER NEW INFLUENCES AND MOVEMENTS

THE CRUSADES. Perhaps the most romantic happenings during the Middle Ages
were that series of adventurous expeditions to the then Far East,
undertaken by the kings and knights of western Europe in an attempt to
reclaim the Holy Land from the infidel Turks, who in the eleventh century
had pushed in and were persecuting Christian pilgrims journeying to
Jerusalem.  For centuries single pilgrims, small bands of pilgrims, and
sometimes large numbers led by priest or noble, had journeyed to distant
shrines, to Rome, and to the birthplace of the Saviour, [24] impelled by
pure religious devotion, a desire to do penance for sin, or seeking a cure
from some disease by prayer and penance. It was the spirit of the age.
Says Adams: [25]

    A pilgrimage was ... in itself a religious act securing merit and
    reward for the one who performed it, balancing a certain number for
    his sins, and making his escape from the world of torment hereafter
    more certain. The more distant and more difficult the pilgrimage, the
    more meritorious, especially if it led to such supremely holy places
    as those which had been sanctified by the presence of Christ himself.
    For the man of the world, for the man who could not, or would not, go
    into monasticism, the pilgrimage was the one conspicuous act by which
    he could satisfy the ascetic need, and gain its rewards. A crusade was
    a stupendous pilgrimage, under especially favorable and meritorious
    conditions.

[Illustration: FIG. 57. A PILGRIM OF THE MIDDLE AGES
(From an old manuscript in the British Museum)]

The Mohammedan Arabs who took possession of the Holy Land in the seventh
century had treated the pilgrims considerately, but the Turks were of a
different stamp. In 1071 they had defeated the Eastern Emperor, captured
all Asia Minor, and had taken possession of the fortress of Nicaea (Map,
p. 183), near Constantinople. The Eastern Emperor now appealed to Rome for
help. In 1077 the Turks captured Jerusalem, and returning pilgrims soon
began to report having experienced great hardships. In 1095 Pope Urban, in
a stirring address to the Council of Clermont (France), issued a call to
the lords, knights, and foot soldiers of western Christendom to cease
destroying their fellow Christians in private warfare, and to turn their
strength of arms against the infidel and rescue the Holy Land. The journey
was to take the place of penance for sin, many special privileges were
extended to those who went, and those who died on the journey or in battle
with the infidels were promised entrance into heaven. [26] nobles and
peasants, filled with a desire for adventure and a sense of personal sin,
no surer way of satisfying either was to be found than the long pilgrimage
to the Saviour's tomb. In France and England the call met with instant
response. Unfortunately for the future of civilization, the call met with
but small response from the nobles of German lands.

The First Crusade set out in 1096. A second went in 1144, and a third in
1187. These were the great Crusades, though five others were undertaken
during the thirteenth century. Jerusalem was taken and lost. The
Christians quarreled with one another and with the Greeks, though with the
Saracens they established somewhat friendly relations, and a mutual
respect arose. The armies which went were composed of all kinds of people
--lords, knights, merchants, adventurers, peasants, outlaws--and a spirit
of adventure and a desire for personal gain, as well as a spirit of
religious devotion, actuated many who went. In 1204 the Venetians diverted
the fourth crusade to the capture of Constantinople, and established there
an outpost of their great commercial empire. The history of the crusades
we do not need to trace. The important matter for our purpose was the
results of the movement on the intellectual development of western Europe.

RESULTS OF THE CRUSADES ON WESTERN EUROPE. In a sense the Crusades were an
outward manifestation of the great change in thinking and ideals which had
begun sometime before in western Europe. They were at once both a sign and
a cause of further change. The old isolation was at last about to end, and
intercommunication and some common ideas and common feelings were being
brought about. Both those who went and those who remained at home were
deeply stirred by the movement. Christendom as a great international
community, in which all alike were interested in a common ideal and in a
common fight against the infidel, was a new idea now dawning upon the mass
of the people, whereas before it had been but little understood.

The travel to distant lands, the sight of cities of wealth and power, and
the contact with peoples decidedly superior to themselves in civilization,
not only excited the imagination and led to a broadening of the minds of
those who returned, but served as well to raise the general level of
intelligence in western Europe. Some new knowledge also was brought back,
but that was not at the time of great importance. The principal gain came
in the elimination forever of thousands of quarreling, fighting noblemen,
[27] thus giving the kingly power a chance to consolidate holdings and
begin the evolution of modern States; in the marked change of attitude
toward the old problems; in the awakening of a new interest in the present
world; in the creation of new interests and new desires among the common
people; in the awakening of a spirit of religious unity and of national
consciousness; and especially in the awakening of a new intellectual life,
which soon found expression in the organization of universities for study
and in more extensive travel and geographical exploration than the world
had known since the days of ancient Rome. The greatest of all the results,
however, came through the revival of trade, commerce, manufacturing, and
industry in the rising cities of western Europe, with the consequent
evolution of a new and important class of merchants, bankers, and
craftsmen, who formed a new city class and in time developed a new system
of training for themselves and their children.

THE REVIVAL OF CITY LIFE. The old cities of central and northern Italy, as
was stated above, continued through the early Middle Ages as places of
some little local importance. In the eleventh century they overthrew in
large part the rule of their Prince-Bishops, and became little City-
Republics, much after the old Greek model. Outside of Italy almost the
only cities not destroyed during the period of the barbarian invasions
were the episcopal cities, that is cities which were the residences of
bishops.

Outside of Italy the present cities of western Europe either rose on the
ruins of former Roman provincial cities, or originated about some
monastery or castle, on or adjacent to land at one time owned by monks or
feudal lord. An ever-increasing company of peasants, themselves little
more than serfs in the beginning, huddled together in such places for the
protection afforded, and a walled feudal town eventually resulted (R. 94
a). This later, in one way or another, secured its freedom from monastic
control or feudal lord, and evolved into the free city we know to-day.
For this I thirsted absent bliss, And thought that sure beyond the seas,
Or else in something near at hand I knew not yet (since nought did
please I knew), my bliss did stand,
IV.

But little did the infant dream That all the treasures of the world were
by:
And that himself was so the cream And crown of all which round about did
lie.
Yet thus it was: The Gem, The Diadem, The Ring enclosing all That stood
upon this earthly ball; The Heavenly Eye, Much wider than the sky, Wherein
they all included were, The glorious Soul that was the King Made to possess
them, did appear A small and little thing.

I must quote from another poem, if only for the pleasure of writing down
the lines:--
THE SALUTATION.

These little limbs, These eyes and hands which here I find, These rosy
cheeks wherewith my life begins-- Where have ye been? Behind What curtain
were ye from me hid so long?
Where was, in what abyss, my speaking tongue?

When silent I So many thousand, thousand years Beneath the dust did in
a chaos lie, How could I smiles or tears Or lips or hands or eyes or ears
perceive?
Welcome ye treasures which I now receive!

These poems waited for two hundred and thirty years to be discovered on a
street bookstall! There are lines in them and whole passages in the
unpublished _Centuries of Meditations_ which almost set one wondering
with Sir Thomas Browne "whether the best of men be known, or whether
there be not more remarkable persons forgot than any that stand
remembered in the known account of Time?"

I am tempted, but will not be drawn to discuss how Traherne stands related
to Vaughan on the one hand and Cowley on the other. I note the discovery
here, and content myself with wondering if the reader share any of my
pleasure in it and enjoyment of the process which brought it to pass.
For me, I was born and bred a bookman. In my father's house the talk
might run on divinity, politics, the theatre; but literature was the
great thing. Other callings might do well enough, but writers were a
class apart, and to be a great writer was the choicest of ambitions. I
grew up in this habit of mind, and have not entirely outgrown it
yet; have not so far outgrown it but that literary discussions,
problems, discoveries engage me though they lie remote from
literature's service to man (who has but a short while to live, and
labour and vanity if he outlast it).

I could join in a hunt after Bunyan's grandmothers, and have actually spent
working days in trying to discover the historical facts of which
_Robinson Crusoe_ may be an allegory. One half of my quarrel with
those who try to prove that Bacon wrote Shakespeare rests on resentment
of the time they force me to waste; and a new searcher for the secret
of the Sonnets has only to whistle and I come to him--though, to be sure,
that gentleman almost cured me who identified the Dark Lady with Ann
Hathaway, resting his case upon--
SONNET CCXVIII.

Whoever hath my wit, thou hast thy Will:
And where is Will alive but _hath a way?_ So in device thy wit is
starved still And as devised by Will. That is to say, My second-best best
bed, yea, and the gear withal Thou hast; but all that capital
messuage Known as New Place goes to Susanna Hall.

Haply the disproportion may engage The harmless
ail-too-wise which otherwise Might knot themselves
disknitting of a clue That Bacon wrote me. Lastly, I devise My wit, to
whom? To wit, to-whit, to-whoo!

And here revoke all previous testaments:
Witness, J. Shaw and Robert Whattcoat, Gents.

After this confession you will pardon any small complacency that may happen
to betray itself in the ensuing narrative.

Mr. Dobell followed up his discovery of Traherne by announcing another
_trouvaille_, and one which excited me not a little:--
"Looking recently over a parcel of pamphlets which I had purchased, I came
upon some loose leaves which were headed _A Prospect of Society_.
The title struck me as familiar, and I had only to read a few lines
to recognise them as belonging to [Goldsmith's] _The Traveller_. But
the opening lines of my fragment are not the opening lines of the poem
as it was published; in fact, the first two lines of _A Prospect of
Society_ are lines 353-4 in the first edition of _The Traveller_. . . .
A further examination of the fragment which I had discovered showed
that it is not what is usually understood as a 'proof' of _The
Traveller_, but rather the material, as yet formless and unarranged,
out of which it was to be finally evolved."

Now--line for corresponding line--the text discovered by Mr.

Dobell often differs, and sometimes considerably, from that of the first
edition of _The Traveller_, and these variations are highly interesting,
and make Mr.
Dobell's 'find' a valuable one. But on studying the newly discovered
version I very soon found myself differing from Mr. Dobell's opinion
that we had here the formless, unarranged material out of which Goldsmith
built an exquisitely articulated poem.[1] And, doubting this, I had to
doubt what Mr. Dobell deduced from it--that "it was in the manner in
which a poem, remarkable for excellence of form and unity of design, was
created out of a number of verses which were at first crudely conceived
and loosely connected that Goldsmith's genius was most triumphantly displayed."
For scarcely had I lit a pipe and fallen to work on _A Prospect of Society_
before it became evident to me (1) that the lines were not "unarranged,"
but disarranged; and (2) that whatever the reason of this disarray,
Goldsmith's brain was not responsible; that the disorder was too
insane to be accepted either as an order in which he could have written
the poem, or as one in which he could have wittingly allowed it
to circulate among his friends, unless he desired them to believe
him mad.

Take, for instance, this collocation:--
"Heavens! how unlike their Belgic sires of old!
Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold; Where shading elms beside the
margin grew, And freshen'd from the waves the zephyr blew."
Or this:--
"To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign, We turn, where France
displays her bright domain.
Thou sprightly land of mirth and social ease, Pleas'd with thyself, whom
all the world can please, How often have I led thy sportive choir
With tuneless pipe, along the sliding Loire?
No vernal bloom their torpid rocks display, But Winter lingering chills
the lap of May; No zephyr fondly sooths the mountain's breast, But
meteors glare and frowning storms invest."
Short of lunacy, no intellectual process would account for that sort
of thing, whereas a poem more pellucidly logical than _The Traveller_ does
not exist in English. So, having lit another pipe, I took a pencil and began
some simple counting, with this result:--
The first 42 lines of _The Prospect_ correspond with lines 353-400 of
_The Traveller_.
The next 42 with lines 311-352.
The next 34 with lines 277-310.

The next 36 with lines 241-276.
The next 36 with lines 205-240.
The next 36 with lines 169-204.
The next 38 with lines 131-168.
The next 28 with lines 103-130.
And the remaining fragment of 18 lines with lines 73-92.

In other words, _The Prospect_ is merely an early draft of _The Traveller_
printed backwards in fairly regular sections.

But how can this have happened? The explanation is at once simple and
ridiculous. As Goldsmith finished writing out each page of his
poem for press, he laid it aside on top of the pages preceding; and, when
all was done, he forgot to sort back his pages in reverse order. That is
all.
Given a good stolid compositor with no thought beyond doing his duty
with the manuscript as it reached him, you have what Mr.

Dobell has recovered-- an immortal poem printed wrong-end-foremost page
by page. I call the result delightful, and (when you come to think of it)
the blunder just so natural to Goldsmith as to be almost
postulable.

Upon this simple explanation we have to abandon the hypothesis that
Goldsmith patiently built a fine poem out of a congeries of fine passages
pitchforked together at haphazard--a splendid rubbish heap; and Mr.
Dobell's find is seen to be an imperfect set of duplicate proofs--fellow,
no doubt, to that set which Goldsmith, mildly objurgating his own or the
printer's carelessness, sliced up with the scissors and rearranged before
submitting it to Johnson's friendly revision.

The pleasantest part of the story (for me) has yet to come. We all know
how easy it is to turn obstinate and defend a pet theory with acrimony.

Mr. Dobell did nothing of the sort. Although his enthusiasm had committed
him to no little expense in publishing _The Prospect_, with a preface
elaborating his theory, he did a thing which was worth a hundred
discoveries. He sat down, convinced himself that my explanation was the
right one, and promptly committed himself to further expense in
bringing out a new edition with the friendliest acknowledgment. So do men
behave who are at once generous of temper and anxious for the
truth.

He himself had been close upon the explanation. In his preface he had
actually guessed that the "author's manuscript, written on loose leaves,
had fallen into confusion and was then printed without any attempt at
rearrangement." In fact, he had hit upon the right solution, and only
failed to follow up the clue.

His find, too, remains a valuable one; for so far as it goes we can collate
it with the first edition of _The Traveller_, and exactly discover the
emendations made by Johnson, or by Goldsmith after discussion
with Johnson. Boswell tells us that the Doctor "in the year 1783,
at my request, marked with a pencil the lines which he had furnished, which
are only line 420, 'To stop too faithful, and too faint to go,' and the
concluding ten lines, except the last couplet but one. . . . He added,
'These are all of which I can be sure.'" We cannot test his claim to
the concluding lines, for the correspondent passage is missing from
Mr.
Dobell's fragment; but Johnson's word would be good enough without
the internal evidence of the verses to back it. "To stop too faithful, and
too faint to go," is his improvement, and an undeniable one, upon Goldsmith's
"And faintly fainter, fainter seems to go." I have not been at pains to
examine all the revised lines, but they are numerous, and generally
(to my thinking) betray Johnson's hand. Also they are almost consistently
improvements. There is one alteration, however,-- unmistakably due to
Johnson,--which some of us will join with Mr. Dobell in regretting. Johnson,
as a fine, full-blooded Jingo, naturally showed some restiveness at the
lines--
"Yes, my lov'd brother, cursed be that hour When first ambition toil'd for
foreign power,"

And induced Goldsmith to substitute--
"Yes, brother, curse with me that baleful hour When first ambition struck
at regal power,"
Which may or may not be more creditable in sentiment, but is certainly
quite irrelevant in its context, which happens to be a denunciation of the
greed for gold and foreign conquest. It is, in that context, all but
meaningless, and must have irritated and puzzled many readers of a poem
otherwise clearly and continuously argued. In future editions of _The
Traveller_, Goldsmith's original couplet should be restored; and I urge
this (let the Tory reader be assured) not from any ill-will towards
our old friend the Divine Right of Kings, but solely in the sacred
name of Logic.

Such be the bookman's trivial adventures and discoveries. They would be
worse than trivial indeed if they led him to forget or ignore that by
which Goldsmith earned his immortality, or to regard Traherne merely as
a freak in the history of literary reputations, and not primarily as
the writer of such words as these--
"A little touch of something like pride is seated in the true sense
of a man's own greatness, without which his humility and modesty would be
contemptible virtues."
"It is a vain and insipid thing to suffer without loving God or man.
Love is a transcendent excellence in every duty, and must of necessity
enter into the nature of every grace and virtue.
That which maketh the solid benefit of patience unknown, its taste so
bitter and comfortless to men, is its _death_ in the separation and
absence of its soul. We suffer but love not."
"All things do first receive that give:
Only 'tis God above That from and in Himself doth live; Whose all-sufficient
love Without original can flow, And all the joys and glories show Which
mortal man can take delight to know.
He is the primitive, eternal Spring, The endless Ocean of each glorious
thing.
The soul a vessel is, A spacious bosom, to contain All the fair
treasures of His bliss, Which run like rivers from, into, the main,
And all it doth receive, return again."

"You never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth in your
veins, till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars."

[1] Early editions of Goldsmith's poem bore the title, _The Traveller;
or, A Prospect of Society_. Later editions dropped the sub-title.

APRIL.

"Thus, then, live I Till 'mid all the gloom By Heaven! the bold sun Is with
me in the room Shining, shining!

"Then the clouds part, Swallows soaring between; The spring is alive And
the meadows are green!

"I jump up like mad, Break the old pipe in twain, And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!"
The poem of FitzGerald's from which these verses come was known, I believe,
to very few until Mr. E. V. Lucas exhumed it from _Half-hours with
the Worst Authors_, and reprinted it in that delightful little book _The
Open Road_. I have a notion that even FitzGerald's most learned executor
was but dimly aware of its existence. For my part, at this time of the
day, I prefer it to his Omar Khayyam--perversely, no doubt.
In the year 1885 or thereabouts Omar, known only to a few, was a
wonder and a treasure to last one's lifetime; but I confess that
since a club took him up and feasted his memory with field-marshals
and other irrelevant persons in the chair, and since his fame has
become vulgarised not only in Thames-side hotels, but over the
length and breadth of the North American continent, one at least
of his admirers has suffered a not unnatural revulsion, until now
he can scarcely endure to read the immortal quatrains.

Immortal they are, no doubt, and deserve to be by reason of their
style--"fame's great antiseptic." But their philosophy is thin after
all, and will not bear discussion. As exercise for a grown man's thought,
I will back a lyric of Blake's or Wordsworth's, or a page of Ibsen's _Peer
Gynt_ against the whole of it, any day.

This, however, is parenthetical. I caught hold of FitzGerald's verses
to express that jollity which should be every man's who looks up from
much reading or writing and knows that Spring has come.

"_Solvitur acris hiems grata vice veris et favoni Trahuntque siccas
machinae carinas_ . . ."

In other words, I look out of the window and decide that the day
has arrived for launching the boat--
"This is that happy morn, That day, long wished day!"

And, to my mind, the birthday of the year. Potentates and capitalists
who send down orders to Cowes or Southampton that their yachts are
to be put in commission, and anon arrive to find everything ready
(if they care to examine), from the steam capstan to the cook's
apron, have little notion of the amusement to be found in fitting
out a small boat, say of five or six tons.

I sometimes doubt if it be not the very flower, or at least the bloom, of
the whole pastime.

The serious face with which we set about it; the solemn procession up the
river to the creek where she rests, the high tide all but lifting her;
the silence in which we loose the moorings and haul off; the first
thrill of buoyant water underfoot; the business of stepping the
mast; quiet days of sitting or pottering about on deck in the sunny
harbour; vessels passing up and down, their crews eyeing us critically
as the rigging grows and the odds and ends--block, tackle and
purchase--fall into their ordered places; and through it all the
expectation running of the summer to come, and 'blue days at sea'
and unfamiliar anchorages--unfamiliar, but where the boat is, home
will be-- 
"Such bliss Beggars enjoy, when princes oft do miss."

Homer, who knew what amused men, constantly lays stress on this business
of fitting out:--
"Then at length she (Athene) let drag the swift ship to the sea, and stored
within it all such tackling as decked ships carry. And she moored it
at the far end of the harbour. . . .

So they raised the mast of pine tree, and set it in the hole of the
cross plank, and made it fast with forestays, and hauled up the white sails
with twisted ropes of oxhide."

And again:

"First of all they drew the ship down to the deep water, and fixed the oars
in leathern loops all orderly, and spread forth the white sails.
And squires, haughty of heart, bare for them their arms,"--but
you'll observe that it was the masters who did the launching, etc.,
like wise men who knew exactly wherein the fun of the business
consisted.

"And they moored her high out in the shore water, and themselves disembarked.
There they supped and waited for evening to come on."

You suggest, perhaps, that our seafaring is but play: and you are right.
But in our play we catch a cupful of the romance of the real thing.

Also we have the real thing at our doors to keep us humble. Day by day beneath
this window the statelier shipping goes by; and our twopenny
adventurings and discoveries do truly (I believe) keep the greater
wonder and interest awake in us from day to day--the wonder and
interest so memorably expressed in Mr.

Bridges's poem, _A Passer By_:--
"Whither, O splendid ship, thy white sails crowding, Leaning across
the bosom of the urgent West, That fearest nor sea rising, nor sky
clouding, Whither away, fair rover, and what thy quest?

Ah! soon when Winter has all our vales opprest, When skies are cold and
misty, and hail is hurling, Wilt thou glide on the blue Pacific,
or rest In a summer haven asleep, thy white sails furling?

"I there before thee, in the country so well thou knowest, Already arrived
am inhaling the odorous air:
I watch thee enter unerringly where thou goest, And anchor queen
of the strange shipping there, Thy sails for awnings spread, thy
masts bare.". . . .

"And yet, O splendid ship, unhailed and nameless, I know not if, aiming
a fancy, I rightly divine That thou hast a purpose joyful, a courage
blameless, Thy port assured in a happier land than mine.
But for all I have given thee, beauty enough is thine.
As thou, aslant with trim tackle and shrouding, From the proud
nostril curve of a prow's line In the offing scatterest foam, thy
white sails crowding."

Though in all human probability I shall never be the first to burst into a
silent sea, I can declare quite seriously that I never steer into an
unfamiliar creek or haven but, as its recesses open, I can understand
something of the awe of the boat's crew in Andrew Marvell's "Bermudas;"
yes, and something of the exultation of the great Columbus himself!

In a later paper I may have to tell of these voyages and traffickings.

For the while I leave the reader to guess how and in what corner of
the coast I happened on the following pendant to Mr.

Dobell's _trouvaille_.

It may not challenge comparison with Mr.

Flinders Petrie's work in Egypt or with Mr.

Hogarth's Cretan explorations; but I say confidently that, since Mr.
Pickwick unearthed the famous inscribed stone, no more fortunate
or astonishing discovery has rewarded literary research upon our
English soil than the two letters which with no small pride I give
to the world this month.

  Curiously enough, they concern Mr. Pickwick.
  
  But, perhaps, by way of preface I shall remind
  the reader that the final number of
  _Pickwick_ was issued in November, 1837. The first
  French version--which Mr. Percy Fitzgerald justly
      calls 'a rude adaptation rather than a
      translation'--appeared in 1838, and was
      entitled _Le Club de Pickwickistes, Roman
      Comique, traduit librement de l'Anglais par
  Mdme.
      Eugenie Giboyet_. With equal
      justice Mr. Fitzgerald complains (_The
  History of Pickwick_, p. 276) that "the most
  fantastic tricks are played with the text,
  most of the dialogue being left out and the whole
      compressed into two small
      volumes." Yet, in fact, Mme.
  Giboyet (as will appear) was more
  sinned against than sinning. Clearly she undertook to
  translate the immortal novel in collaboration with
  a M. Alexandre D--', and was driven by the author's
  disapproval to suppress M. D--'s share of the work.

The dates are sufficient evidence that this was done (as it no doubt
had to be done) in haste.

I regret that my researches have yielded no further information
respecting this M. Alexandre D--'. The threat in the second letter
may or may not have been carried out.Contrast the state of civilization in Spain and the rest of Europe
about 1100 (85, 86).

2. Considering Aristotle's great intellectual worth (88) and work (87), is
it to be wondered that the mediaevals regarded him with such reverence?

3. Do we today accept Abelard's premise (91 a) as to attaining wisdom?
Would his questions (91 b) excite much interest to-day?

4. How do you explain the change in attitude toward him shown by the
successive statutes enacted (90 a-d) for the University of Paris?

5. Would the extract from Roger Bacon (89) lead you to think him a man
ahead of the times in which he lived? Why?

6. Did scholasticism represent the innocent intellectual activity, from
the Church point of view, pictured by Rashdall (92)?

7. What were the main things Justinian hoped to accomplish by the
preparation of the great Code, as set forth in the Preface (93)?

8. Characterize the mediaeval town by the eleventh century (94 a). What
was the nature of the progress from that time to the thirteenth century
(94 b)?

9. What were the chief privileges contained in the town charter of
Walling-ford (95), and what position does it indicate was held by the
guild-merchant therein?

10. What does the oath of a freeman (96) indicate as to social conditions?

11. State the chief regulations imposed on its members by the White-
Tawyers' Guild (97). Compare these regulations with those of a modern
labor union, such as the plumbers. With a fraternal order, such as the
Masons.

12. What is indicated as to the educational advantages provided by the
Guild of Saint Nicholas, in the city of Worcester, by the extract (98)
taken from the Report of the King's Commissioner?

13. Does a comparison of Readings 99, 201, and 242 indicate a static
condition of apprenticeship education for centuries?

CHAPTER IX

THE RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES


EVOLUTION OF THE _STUDIUM GENERALE_. In the preceding chapter we described
briefly the new movement toward association which characterized the
eleventh and the twelfth centuries--the municipal movement, the merchant
guilds, the trade guilds, etc. These were doing for civil life what
monasticism had earlier done for the religious life. They were collections
of like-minded men, who united themselves into associations or guilds for
mutual benefit, protection, advancement, and self-government within the
limits of their city, business, trade, or occupation. This tendency toward
association, in the days when state government was weak or in its infancy,
was one of the marked features of the transition time from the early
period of the Middle Ages, when the Church was virtually the State, to the
later period of the Middle Ages, when the authority of the Church in
secular matters was beginning to weaken, modern nations were beginning to
form, and an interest in worldly affairs was beginning to replace the
previous inordinate interest in the world to come.

We also noted in the preceding chapters that certain cathedral and
monastery schools, but especially the cathedral schools, [1] stimulated by
the new interest in Dialectic, were developing into much more than local
teaching institutions designed to afford a supply of priests of some
little education for the parishes of the bishopric. Once York and later
Canterbury, in England, had had teachers who attracted students from other
bishoprics. Paris had for long been a famous center for the study of the
Liberal Arts and of Theology. Saint Gall had become noted for its music.
Theologians coming from Paris (1167-68) had given a new impetus to study
among the monks at Oxford. A series of political events in northern Italy
had given emphasis to the study of law in many cities, and the Moslems in
Spain had stimulated the schools there and in southern France to a study
of medicine and Aristotelian science. Rome was for long a noted center for
study. Gradually these places came to be known as _studia publica_, or
_studia generalia_, meaning by this a generally recognized place of study,
where lectures were open to any one, to students of all countries and of
all conditions. [2] Traveling students came to these places from afar to
hear some noted teacher read and comment on the famous textbooks of the
time.

From the first both teachers and students had been considered as members
of the clergy, and hence had enjoyed the privileges and immunities
extended to that class, but, now that the students were becoming so
numerous and were traveling so far, some additional grant of protection
was felt to be desirable. Accordingly the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,
[3] in 1158, issued a general proclamation of privileges and protection
(R. 101). In this he ordered that teachers and students traveling "to the
places in which the studies are carried on" should be protected from
unjust arrest, should be permitted to "dwell in security," and in case of
suit should be tried "before their professors or the bishop of the city."
This document marks the beginning of a long series of rights and
privileges granted to the teachers and students of the universities now in
process of evolution in western Europe.

THE UNIVERSITY EVOLUTION. The development of a university out of a
cathedral or some other form of school represented, in the Middle Ages, a
long local evolution. Universities were not founded then as they are to-
day. A teacher of some reputation drew around him a constantly increasing
body of students. Other teachers of ability, finding a student body
already there, also "set up their chairs" and began to teach. Other
teachers and more students came. In this way a _studium_ was created.
About these teachers in time collected other university servants--
"bedells, librarians, lower officials, preparers of parchment, scribes,
illuminators of parchment, and others who serve it," as Count Rupert
enumerated them in the Charter of Foundation granted, in 1386, to
Heidelberg (R. 103). At Salerno, as we have already seen (p. 199), medical
instruction arose around the work of Constantine of Carthage and the
medicinal springs found in the vicinity. Students journeyed there from
many lands, and licenses to practice the medical art were granted there as
early as 1137. At Bologna, we have also seen (p. 195), the work of
Irnerius and Gratian early made this a great center for the study of civil
and canon law, and their pupils spread the taste for these new subjects
throughout Europe. Paris for two centuries had been a center for the study
of the Arts and of Theology, and a succession of famous teachers--William
of Champeaux, Abelard, Peter the Lombard--had taught there. So important
was the theological teaching there that Paris has been termed "the Sinai
of instruction" of the Middle Ages.

By the beginning of the thirteenth century both students and teachers had
become so numerous, at a number of places in western Europe, that they
began to adopt the favorite mediaeval practice and organized themselves
into associations, or guilds, for further protection from extortion and
oppression and for greater freedom from regulation by the Church. They now
sought and obtained additional privileges for themselves, and, in
particular, the great mediaeval document--a charter of rights and
privileges. [4] As both teachers and students were for long regarded as
_clerici_ the charters were usually sought from the Pope, but in some
cases they were obtained from the king. [5] These associations of
scholars, or teachers, or both, "born of the need of companionship which
men who cultivate their intelligence feel," sought to perform the same
functions for those who studied and taught that the merchant and craft
guilds were performing for their members. The ruling idea was association
for protection, and to secure freedom for discussion and study; the
obtaining of corporate rights and responsibilities; and the organization
of a system of apprenticeship, based on study and developing through
journeyman into mastership, [6] as attested by an examination and the
license to teach. In the rise of these teacher and student guilds [7] we
have the beginnings of the universities of western Europe, and their
organization into chartered teaching groups (R. 100) was simply another
phase of that great movement toward the association of like-minded men for
worldly purposes which began to sweep over the rising cities in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. [8]

The term _universitas_, or _university_, which came in time to be applied
to these associations of masters and apprentices in study, was a general
Roman legal term, practically equivalent to our modern word _corporation_.
At first it was applied to any association, and when used with reference
to teachers and scholars was so stated. Thus, in addressing the masters
and students at Paris, Pope Innocent, in 1205, writes: "_Universis
magistris et scholaribus Parisiensibus_", that is, "to the corporation of
masters and scholars at Paris." Later the term _university_ became
restricted to the meaning which we give it to-day.

The university mothers. Though this movement for association and the
development of advanced study had manifested itself in a number of places
by the close of the twelfth century, two places in particular led all the
others and became types which were followed in charters and in new
creations. These were Bologna and Paris. [9] After one or the other of
these two nearly all the universities of western Europe were modeled.
Bologna or Paris, or one of their immediate children, served as a pattern.
Thus Bologna was the university mother for almost all the Italian
universities; for Montpellier and Grenoble in southern France; for some of
the Spanish universities; and for Glasgow, Upsala, Cracow, and for the Law
Faculty at Oxford. Paris was the university mother for Oxford, and through
her Cambridge; for most of the northern French universities; for the
university of Toulouse, which in turn became the mother for other southern
French and northern Spanish universities; for Lisbon and Coimbra in
Portugal; for the early German universities at Prague, Vienna, Cologne,
and Heidelberg; and through Cologne for Copenhagen. Through one of the
colleges at Cambridge--Emmanuel--she became, indirectly, the mother of a
new Cambridge in America--Harvard--founded in 1636. Figure 61 shows the
location of the chief universities founded before 1600. Viewed from the
standpoint of instruction, Paris was followed almost entirely in Theology,
and Bologna in Law, while the three centers which most influenced the
development of instruction in medicine were Salerno, Montpellier, and
Salamanca.

[Illustration: FIG. 61. SHOWING LOCATION OF THE CHIEF UNIVERSITIES FOUNDED
BEFORE 1600]

While the earlier universities gradually arose as the result of a long
local evolution, it in time became common for others to be founded by a
migration of professors from an older university to some cathedral city
having a developing _studium_. In the days when a university consisted
chiefly of master and students, when lectures could be held in any kind of
a building or collection of buildings, and when there were no libraries,
laboratories, campus, or other university property to tie down an
institution, it was easy to migrate. Thus, in 1209, the school at
Cambridge was created a university by a secession of masters from Oxford,
much as bees swarm from a hive. Sienna, Padua, Reggio, Vicenza, Arezzo
resulted from "swarmings" from Bologna; and Vercelli from Vicenza. In
1228, after a student riot at Paris which provoked reprisals from the
city, many of the masters and students went to the studium towns of
Angers, Orleans, and Rheims, and universities were established at the
first two. Migrations from Prague helped establish many of the German
universities. In this way the university organization was spread over
Europe. In 1200 there were but six _studia generalia_ which can be
considered as having evolved into universities--Salerno, Bologna, and
Reggio, in Italy; Paris and Montpellier, in France; and Oxford, in
England. By 1300 eight more had evolved in Italy, three more in France,
Cambridge in England, and five in Spain and Portugal. By 1400 twenty-two
additional universities had developed, five of which were in German lands,
and by 1500 thirty-five more had been founded, making a total of eighty.
By 1600 the total had been raised to one hundred and eight (R. 100, for
list by countries, dates, and method of founding). Some of these
(approximately thirty) afterwards died, while in the following centuries
additional ones were created. [10]

PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES GRANTED. The grant of privileges to physicians
and teachers made by the Emperor Constantine, in 333 A.D. (R. 26), and the
privileges and immunities granted to the clergy (_clerici_) by the early
Christian Roman Emperors (R. 38), doubtless formed a basis for the many
grants of special privileges made to the professors and students in the
early universities. The document promulgated by Frederick Barbarossa, in
1158 (R. 101), began the granting of privileges to the _studia generalia_,
and this was followed by numerous other grants. The grant to students of
freedom from trial by the city authorities, and the obligation of every
citizen of Paris to seize any one seen striking a student, granted by
Philip Augustus, in 1200 (R. 102), is another example, widely followed, of
the bestowal of large privileges. Count Rupert I, in founding the
University of Heidelberg, in 1386, granted many privileges, exempted the
students from "any duty, levy, imposts, tolls, excises, or other exactions
whatever" while coming to, studying at, or returning home from the
university (R. 103). The exemption from taxation (R. 104) became a matter
of form, and was afterwards followed in the chartering of American
colleges (R. 187). Exemption from military service also was granted.

So valuable an asset was a university to a city, and so easy was it for a
university to move almost overnight, that cities often, and at times even
nations, encouraged not only the founding of universities, but also the
migration of both faculties and students. An interesting case of a city
bidding for the presence of a university is that of Vercelli (R. 105),
which made a binding agreement, as a part of the city charter, whereby the
city agreed with a body of masters and students "swarming" from Padua to
loan the students money at lower than the regular rates, to see that there
was plenty of food in the markets at no increase in prices, and to protect
the students from injustice. An instance of bidding by a State is the case
of Cambridge, which obtained quite an addition by the coming of striking
Paris masters and students in 1229, in response to the pledge of King
Henry III (R. 109), who "humbly sympathized with them for their sufferings
at Paris," and promised them that if they would come "to our kingdom of
England and remain there to study" he would assign to them "cities,
boroughs, towns, whatsoever you may wish to select, and in every fitting
way will cause you to rejoice in a state of liberty and tranquillity."

One of the most important privileges which the universities early
obtained, and a rather singular one at that, was the right of _cessatio_,
which meant the right to stop lectures and go on a strike as a means of
enforcing a redress of grievances against either town or church authority
(R. 107). This right was for long jealously guarded by the university, and
frequently used to defend itself from the smallest encroachments on its
freedom to teach, study, and discipline the members of its guild as it saw
fit, and often the right not to discipline them at all. Often the
_cessatio_ was invoked on very trivial grounds, as in the case of the
Oxford _cessatio_ of 1209 (R. 108), the Paris _cessatio_ of 1229 (R. 109),
and the numerous other _cessationes_ which for two centuries [11]
repeatedly disturbed the continuity of instruction at Paris.

DEGREES IN THE GUILD. The most important of the university rights,
however, was the right to examine and license its own teachers (R. 110),
and to grant the license to teach (Rs. 111, 112). Founded as the
universities were after the guild model, they were primarily places for
the taking of apprentices in the Arts, developing them into journeymen and
masters, and certifying to their proficiency in the teaching craft. [12]
Their purpose at first was to prepare teachers, and the giving of
instruction to students for cultural ends, or a professional training for
practical use aside from teaching the subject, was a later development.

Accordingly it came about in time that, after a number of years of study
in the Arts under some master, a student was permitted to present himself
for a test as to his ability to define words, determine the meaning of
phrases, and read the ordinary Latin texts in Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic
(the _Trivium_), to the satisfaction of other masters than his own. In
England this test came to be known by the term _determine_. Its passage
was equivalent to advancing from apprenticeship to the ranks of a
journeyman, and the successful candidate might now be permitted to assist
the master, or even give some elementary instruction himself while
continuing his studies. He now became an assistant or companion, and by
the fourteenth century was known as a _baccalaureus_, a term used in the
Church, in chivalry, and in the guilds, and which meant a _beginner_.
There was at first, though, no thought of establishing an examination and
a new degree for the completion of this first step in studies. The
bachelor's degree was a later development, sought at first by those not
intending to teach, and eventually erected into a separate degree.

When the student had finally heard a sufficient number of courses, as
required by the statutes of his guild, he might present himself for
examination for the teaching license. This was a public trial, and took
the form of a public disputation on some stated thesis, in the presence of
the masters, and against all comers. It was the student's "masterpiece,"
analogous to the masterpiece of any other guild, and he submitted it to a
jury of the masters of his craft. [13] Upon his masterpiece being adjudged
satisfactory, he also became a master in his craft, was now able to define
and dispute, was formally admitted to the highest rank in the teaching
guild, might have a seal, and was variously known as master, doctor, or
professor, all of which were once synonymous terms. [14] If he wished to
prepare himself for teaching one of the professional subjects he studied
still further, usually for a number of years, in one of the professional
faculties, and in time he was declared to be a Doctor of Law, or Medicine,
or of Theology.

[Illustration: FIG 62. SEAL OF A DOCTOR, UNIVERSITY OF PARIS]

THE TEACHING FACULTIES. The students for a long time grouped themselves
for better protection (and aggression) according to the nation from which
they came, [15] and each "nation" elected a _councilor_ to look after the
interests of its members. Between the different nations there were
constant quarrels, insults were passed back and forth, and much bad blood
engendered. [16] On the side of the masters the organization was by
teaching subjects, and into what came to be known as _faculties_. [17]
Thus there came to be four faculties in a fully organized mediaeval
university, representing the four great divisions of knowledge which had
been evolved--Arts, Law, Medicine, and Theology. Each faculty elected a
_dean_, and the deans and councilors elected a _rector_, who was the head
or president of the university. The _chancellor_, the successor of the
cathedral school _scholasticus_, was usually appointed by the Pope and
represented the Church, and a long struggle ensued between the rector and
the chancellor to see who should be the chief authority in the university.
The rector was ultimately victorious, and the position of chancellor
became largely an honorary position of no real importance.

[Illustration: FIG. 63. NEW COLLEGE, AT OXFORD
One of the oldest of the Oxford colleges, having been founded in 1379. The
picture shows the chapel, cloisters (consecrated in 1400), and a tall
tower, once forming a part of the Oxford city walls. Note the similarity
of this early college to a monastery, as in Plate 1.]

The Arts Faculty was the successor of the old cathedral-school instruction
in the Seven Liberal Arts, and was found in practically all the
universities. The Law Faculty embraced civil and canon law, as worked out
at Bologna. The Medical Faculty taught the knowledge of the medical art,
as worked out at Salerno and Montpellier. The Theological Faculty, the
most important of the four, prepared learned men for the service of the
Church, and was for some two centuries controlled by the scholastics. The
Arts Faculty was preparatory to the other three. As Latin was the language
of the classroom, and all the texts were Latin texts, a reading and
speaking knowledge of Latin was necessary before coming to the university
to study. This was obtained from a study of the first of the Seven Arts--
Grammar--in some monastery, cathedral, or other type of school. Thus a
knowledge of Latin formed practically the sole requirement for admission
to the mediaeval university, and continued to be the chief admission
requirement in our universities up to the nineteenth century (R. 186 a).
In Europe it is still of great importance as a preparatory subject, but in
South American countries it is not required at all.

Very few of the universities, in the beginning, had all four of these
faculties. The very nature of the evolution of the earlier ones precluded
this. Thus Bologna had developed into a _studium generale_ from its
prominence in law, and was virtually constituted a university in 1158, but
it did not add Medicine until 1316, or Theology until 1360. Paris began
sometime before 1200 as an arts school, Theology with some instruction in
Canon Law was added by 1208, a Law Faculty in 1271, and a Medical Faculty
in 1274. Montpellier began as a medical school sometime in the twelfth
century. Law followed a little later, a teacher from Bologna "setting up
his chair" there. Arts was organized by 1242. A sort of theological school
began in 1263, but it was not chartered as a faculty until 1421. So it was
with many of the early universities. These four traditional faculties were
well established by the fourteenth century, and continued as the typical
form of university organization until modern times. With the great
university development and the great multiplication of subjects of study
which characterized the nineteenth century, many new faculties and schools
and colleges have had to be created, particularly in the United States, in
response to new modern demands. [18]

NATURE OF THE INSTRUCTION. The teaching material in each faculty was much
as we have already indicated. After the recovery of the works of Aristotle
he came to dominate the instruction in the Faculty of Arts. [19] The
Statutes of Paris, in 1254, giving the books to be read for the A.B. and
the A.M. degrees (R. 113), show how fully Aristotle had been adopted there
as the basis for instruction in Logic, Ethics, and Natural Philosophy by
that time. The books required for these two degrees at Leipzig, in 1410
(R. 114), show a much better-balanced course of instruction, though the
time requirements given for each subject show how largely Aristotle
predominated there also. Oxford (R. 115) kept up better the traditions of
the earlier Seven Liberal Arts in its requirements, and classified the new
works of Aristotle in three additional "philosophies"--natural, moral, and
metaphysical. From four to seven years were required to complete the arts
course, though the tendency was to reduce the length of the arts course as
secondary schools below the university were evolved. [20]

In the Law Faculty, after Theology the largest and most important of all
the faculties in the mediaeval university, the _Corpus Juris Civilis_ of
Justinian (p. 195) and the _Decretum_ of Gratian (p. 196) were the
textbooks read, with perhaps a little more practical work in discussion
than in Arts or Medicine. The Oxford course of study in both Civil and
Canon Law (R. 116 b-c) gives a good idea as to what was required for
degrees in one of the best of the early law faculties.

In the Medical Faculty a variety of books--translations of Hippocrates (p.
197), Galen (p. 198), Avicenna (p. 198), and the works of certain writers
at Salerno and Jewish and Moslem writers in Spain--were read and lectured
on. The list of medical books used at Montpellier, [21] in 1340, which at
that time was the foremost place for medical instruction in western
Europe, shows the book-nature and the extent of the instruction given at
the leading school of medicine of the time. It was, moreover, customary at
Montpellier for the senior students to spend a summer in visiting the sick
and doing practical work. We have here the merest beginnings of clinical
instruction and hospital service, and at this stage medical instruction
remained until quite modern times. The medical courses at Paris (R. 117)
and Oxford (R. 116 d) were less satisfactory, only book instruction being
required.

[Illustration: FIG. 64. A LECTURE ON CIVIL LAW BY GUILLAUME BENEDICTI
(After a sixteenth-century wood engraving, now in the National Library,
Paris, Cabinet of Designs)]

Both Law and Medicine were so dominated by the scholastic ideal and
methods that neither accomplished what might have been possible in a freer
atmosphere.

In the Theological Faculty the _Sentences_ of Peter Lombard (p. 189) and
the _Summa Theologiae_ of Thomas Aquinas (p. 191) were the textbooks used.
The Bible was at first also used somewhat, but later came to be largely
overshadowed by the other books and by philosophical discussions and
debates on all kinds of hair-splitting questions, kept carefully within
the limits prescribed by the Church. The requirements at Oxford (R. 116 a)
give the course of instruction in one of the best of the theological
faculties of the time. The teachers were scholastics, and scholastic
methods and ideals everywhere prevailed. Roger Bacon's (1214-1294)
criticism of this type of theological study (R. 118), which he calls
"horse loads, not at all [in consonance] with the most holy text of God,"
and "philosophical, both in substance and method," gives an idea of the
kind of instruction which came to prevail in the theological faculties
under the dominance of the scholastic philosophers.

Years of study were required in each of these three professional
faculties, as is shown by the statement of requirements as given for
Montpellier, Paris (R. 117), and Oxford (R. 116 a).

[Illustration: FIG. 65. LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LEYDEN, IN HOLLAND
(After an engraving by J. C. Woudanus, dated 1610)
This shows well the chained books, and a common type of bookcase in use in
monasteries, churches, and higher schools. Counting 35 books to the case,
this shows a library of 35 volumes on mathematics; 70 volumes each on
literature, philosophy, and medicine; 140 volumes of historical books; 175
volumes on civil and canon law; and 160 volumes on theology, or a total of
770 volumes--a good-sized library for the time.]

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. A very important reason why so long a period of
study was required in each of the professional faculties, as well as in
the Faculty of Arts, is to be found in the lack of textbooks and the
methods of instruction followed. While the standard textbooks were
becoming much more common, due to much copying and the long-continued use
of the same texts, they were still expensive and not owned by many. [22]

[Illustration: PLATE 4. A LECTURE ON THEOLOGY BY ALBERTUS MAGNUS
An illuminated picture in a manuscript of 1310, now in the royal
collection of copper engravings, at Berlin. The master in his chair is
here shown "reading" to his students.]

To provide a loan collection of theological books for poor students we
find, in 1271, a gift by will to the University of Paris (R. 119) of a
private library, containing twenty-seven books. Even if the students
possessed books, the master "read" [23] and commented from his "gloss" at
great length on the texts being studied. Besides the mere text each
teacher had a "gloss" or commentary for it--that is, a mass of explanatory
notes, summaries, cross-references, opinions by others, and objections to
the statements of the text. The "gloss" was a book in itself, often larger
than the text, and these standard glosses, [24] or commentaries, were used
in the university instruction for centuries. In Theology and Canon Law
they were particularly extensive.

All instruction, too, was in Latin. The professor read from the Latin text
and gloss, repeating as necessary, and to this the student listened.
Sometimes he read so slowly that the text could be copied, but in 1355
this method was prohibited at Paris (R. 121), and students who tried to
force the masters to follow it "by shouting or whistling or raising a din,
or by throwing stones," were to be suspended for a year. The first step in
the instruction was a minute and subtle analysis of the text itself, in
which each line was dissected, analyzed, and paraphrased, and the comments
on the text by various authors were set forth. Next all passages capable
of two interpretations were thrown into the form of a question; _pro_ and
_contra_, after the manner of Abelard. The arguments on each side were
advanced, and the lecturer's conclusion set forth and defended. The text
was thus worked over day after day in minute detail. Having as yet but
little to teach, the masters made the most of what they had. A good
example of the mediaeval plan of university instruction is found in the
announcement of Odofredus, a distinguished teacher of Law at Bologna,
about the middle of the thirteenth century, which Rashdall thinks is
equally applicable to methods in other subjects. Odofredus says:

    First, I shall give you summaries of each title before I proceed to
    the text; secondly, I shall give you as clear and explicit a statement
    as I can of the purport of each Law (included in the title); thirdly,
    I shall read the text with a view to correcting it; fourthly, I shall
    briefly repeat the contents of the Law; fifthly, I shall solve
    apparent contradictions, adding any general principles of Law (to be
    extracted from the passage), and any distinctions and subtle and
    useful problems arising out of the Law with their solutions, as far as
    the Divine Providence shall enable me. And if any Law shall seem
    deserving, by reason of its celebrity or difficulty, of a Repetition,
    I shall reserve it for an evening Repetition.

It will be seen that both students and professors were bound to the text,
as were the teachers of the Seven Liberal Arts in the cathedral schools
before them. There was no appeal to the imagination, still less to
observation, experiment, or experience. Each generation taught what it had
learned, except that from time to time some thinker made a new
organization, or some new body of knowledge was unearthed and added.

Another method much used was the debate, or disputation, and participation
in a number of these was required for degrees (R. 116). These disputations
were logical contests, not unlike a modern debate, in which the students
took sides, cited authorities, and summarized arguments, all in Latin.
Sometimes a student gave an exhibition in which he debated both sides of a
question, and summarized the argument, after the manner of the professors.
As a corrective to the memorization of lectures and texts, these
disputations served a useful purpose in awakening intellectual vigor and
logical keenness. They were very popular until into the sixteenth century,
when new subject-matter and new ways of thinking offered new opportunities
for the exercise of the intellect.

[Illustration: FIG. 66. A UNIVERSITY DISPUTATION
(From Fick's _Auf Deutschland's Höhen Schulen_)]

In teaching equipment there was almost nothing at first, and but little
for centuries to come. Laboratories, workshops, _gymnasia_, good buildings
and classrooms--all alike were equally unknown. Time schedules of lectures
(Rs. 122, 123) came in but slowly, in such matters each professor being a
free lance. Nor were there any libraries at first, though in time these
developed. For a long time books were both expensive and scarce (Rs. 78,
119, 120). After the invention of printing (first book printed in 1456),
university libraries increased rapidly and soon became the chief feature
of the university equipment. Figure 65 shows the library of the University
of Leyden, in Holland, thirty-five years after its foundation, and about
one hundred and fifty years after the beginnings of printing. It shows a
rather large increase in the size of book collections [25] after the
introduction of printing, and a good library organization.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 67. A UNIVERSITY LECTURE AND LECTURE ROOM

VALUE OF THE TRAINING GIVEN. Measured in terms of modern standards the
instruction was undoubtedly poor, unnecessarily drawn out, and the
educational value low. We could now teach as much information, and in a
better manner, in but a fraction of the time then required. Viewed also by
the standards of instruction in the higher schools of Greece and Rome the
conditions were almost equally bad. Viewed, though, from the standpoint of
what had prevailed in western Europe during the dark period of the early
Middle Ages, it represented a marked advance in method and content--except
in pure literature, where there was an undoubted decline due to the
absorbing interest in Dialectic--and it particularly marked a new spirit,
as nearly critical as the times would allow. Despite the heterogeneous and
but partially civilized student body, youthful and but poorly prepared for
study, the drunkenness and fighting, the lack of books and equipment, the
large classes and the poor teaching methods, and the small amount of
knowledge which formed the grist for their mills and which they ground
exceeding small, these new universities held within themselves, almost in
embryo form, the largest promise for the intellectual future of western
Europe which had appeared since the days of the old universities of the
Hellenic world (R. 124). In these new institutions knowledge was not only
preserved and transmitted, but was in time to be tremendously advanced and
extended. They were the first organizations to break the monopoly of the
Church in learning and teaching; they were the centers to which all new
knowledge gravitated; under their shadow thousands of young men found
intellectual companionship and in their classrooms intellectual
stimulation; and in encouraging "laborious subtlety, heroic industry, and
intense application", even though on very limited subject-matter, and in
training "men to think and work rather than to enjoy" (R. 124), they were
preparing for the time when western Europe should awaken to the riches of
Greece and Rome and to a new type of intellectual life of its own. From
these beginnings the university organization has persisted and grown and
expanded, and to-day stands, the Synagogue and the Catholic Church alone
excepted, as the oldest organized institution of human society.

The manifest tendency of the universities toward speculation, though for
long within limits approved by the Church, was ultimately to awaken
inquiry, investigation, rational thinking, and to bring forth the modern
spirit. The preservation and transmission of knowledge was by the
university organization transferred from the monastery to the school, from
monks to doctors, and from the Church to a body of logically trained men,
only nominally members of the _clerici_. Their successors would in time
entirely break away from connections with either Church or State, and
stand forth as the independent thinkers and scholars in the arts,
sciences, professions, and even in Theology. University graduates in
Medicine would in time wage a long struggle against bigotry to lay the
foundations of modern medicine. Graduates in Law would contend with kings
and feudal lords for larger privileges for the as yet lowly common man,
and would help to usher in a period of greater political equality. The
university schools of Theology were in time to send forth the keenest
critics of the practices of the Church. Out of the university cloisters
were to come the men--Dante, Petrarch, Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, Calvin,
Copernicus, Galileo, Newton--who were to usher in the modern spirit.

The universities as a public force. Almost from the first the universities
availed themselves of their privileges and proclaimed a bold independence.
The freedom from arrest and trial by the civil authorities for petty
offenses, or even for murder, and the right to go on a strike if in any
way interfered with, were but beginnings in independence in an age when
such independence seemed important. These rights were in time given up,
[26] and in their place the much more important rights of liberty to study
as truth seemed to lead, freedom in teaching as the master saw the truth,
and the right to express themselves as an institution on public questions
which seemed to concern them, were slowly but definitely taken on in place
of the earlier privileges. Virtually a new type of members of society--a
new Estate--was evolved, ranking with Church, State, and nobility, and
this new Estate soon began to express itself in no uncertain tones on
matters which concerned both Church and State. The universities were
democratic in organization and became democratic in spirit, representing a
heretofore unknown and unexpressed public opinion in western Europe. They
did not wait to be asked; they gave their opinions unsolicited. "The
authority of the University of Paris," writes one contemporary, "has risen
to such a height that it is necessary to satisfy it, no matter on what
conditions." The university "wanted to meddle with the government of the
Pope, the King, and everything else," writes another. We find Paris
intervening repeatedly in both church and state affairs, [27] and
representing French nationality before it had come into being, as the so-
called Holy Roman Empire represented the Germans, and the Papacy
represented the Italians. In Montpellier, professors of Law were
considered as knights, and after twenty years of practice they became
counts. In Bologna we find the professors of Law one of the three
assemblies of the city. Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, and the Scottish
universities were given representation in Parliament. The German
universities were from the first prominent in political affairs, and in
the reformation struggle of the early sixteenth century they were the
battle-grounds.

In an age of oppression these university organizations stood for freedom.
In an age of force they began the substitution of reason. In the centuries
from the end of the Dark Ages to the Reformation they were the homes of
free thought. They early assumed national character and proclaimed a bold
independence. Questions of State and Church they discussed with a freedom
before unknown. They presented their grievances to both kings and popes,
from both they obtained new privileges, to both they freely offered their
advice, and sometimes both were forced to do their bidding. At times
important questions of State, such as the divorce of Philip of France and
that of Henry VIII of England, were submitted to them for decision. They
were not infrequently called upon to pass upon questions of doctrine or
heresy. "Kings and princes," says Rashdall, in an excellent summary as to
the value and influence of the mediaeval university instruction (R. 124),
"found their statesmen and men of business in the universities, most
often, no doubt, among those trained in the practical science of Law."
Talleyrand is said to have asserted that "their theologians made the best
diplomats." For the first time since the downfall of Rome the
administration of human affairs was now placed once more in the hands of
educated men. By the interchange of students from all lands and their
hospitality, such as it was, to the stranger, the universities tended to
break down barriers and to prepare Europe for larger intercourse and for
more of a common life.

On the masses of the people, of course, they had little or no influence,
and could not have for centuries to come. Their greatest work, as has been
the case with universities ever since their foundation, was that of
drawing to their classrooms the brightest minds of the times, the most
capable and the most industrious, and out of this young raw material
training the leaders of the future in Church and State. Educationally, one
of their most important services was in creating a surplus of teachers in
the Arts who had to find a market for their abilities in the rising
secondary schools. These developed rapidly after 1200, and to these we owe
a somewhat more general diffusion of the little learning and the
intellectual training of the time. In preparing future leaders for State
and Church in law, theology, and teaching, the universities, though
sometimes opposed and their opinions ignored, nevertheless contributed
materially to the making and moulding of national history. The first great
result of their work in training leaders we see in the Renaissance
movement of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, to which we next turn.
In this movement for a revival of the ancient learning, and the subsequent
movements for a purer and a better religious life, the men trained by the
universities were the leaders.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Why would the _studia publica_ tend to attract a different type of
scholar than those in the monasteries, and gradually to supersede them in
importance?

2. Show how the mediaeval university was a gradual and natural evolution,
as distinct from a founded university of to-day.

3. Show that the university charter was a first step toward independence
from church and state control.

4. Show the relation between the system of apprenticeship developed for
student and teacher in a mediaeval university, and the stages of student
and teacher in a university of to-day.

5. Show how the chartered university of the Middle Ages was an
"association of like-minded men for worldly purposes."

6. To what university mother does Harvard go back, ultimately?

7. Show how the English and the German universities are extreme evolutions
from the mediaeval type, and our American universities a combination of
the two extremes.

8. Do university professors to-day have privileges akin to those granted
professors in a mediaeval university?

9. What has caused the old Arts Faculty to break up into so many groups,

PART III

THE TRANSITION FROM MEDIAEVAL TO MODERN ATTITUDES

THE RECOVERY OF THE ANCIENT LEARNING
THE REAWAKENING OF SCHOLARSHIP AND
THE RISE OF RELIGIOUS AND SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY


CHAPTER X

THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING


THE PERIOD OF CHANGE. The thirteenth century has often been called the
wonderful century of the mediaeval world. It was wonderful largely in that
the forces struggling against mediaevalism to evolve the modern spirit
here first find clear expression. It was a century of rapid and
unmistakable progress in almost every line. By its close great changes
were under way which were destined ultimately to shake off the incubus of
mediaevalism and to transform Europe. In many respects, though, the
fourteenth was a still more wonderful century.

The evolution of the universities which we have just traced was one of the
most important of these thirteenth-century manifestations. Lacking in
intellectual material, but impelled by the new impulses beginning to work
in the world, the scholars of the time went earnestly to work, by
speculative methods, to organize the dogmatic theology of the Church into
a system of thinking. The result was Scholasticism. From one point of view
the result was barren; from another it was full of promise for the future.
Though the workers lacked materials, were overshadowed by the mediaeval
spirit of authority, and kept their efforts clearly within limits approved
by the Church, the "heroic industry" and the "in tense application"
displayed in effecting the organization, and the logical subtlety
developed in discussing the results, promised much for the future. The
rise of university instruction, and the work of the Scholastics in
organizing the knowledge of the time, were both a resultant of new
influences already at work and a prediction of larger consequences to
follow. In a later age, and with men more emancipated from church control,
the same spirit was destined to burst forth in an effort to discover and
reconstruct the historic past.

During the thirteenth century, too, the new Estate, which had come into
existence alongside of the clergy and the nobility, began to assume large
importance. The arts-and-crafts guilds were attaining a large development,
and out of this new burgher class the great general public of modern times
has in time evolved. Trade and industry were increasing in all lands, and
merchants and successful artisans were becoming influential through their
newly obtained wealth and rights. The erection of stately churches and
town halls, often beautifully carved and highly ornamented, was taking
place. Great cathedrals, those "symphonies in stone," of which Notre Dame
(Figure 53) is a good example, were rising or being further expanded and
decorated at many places in western Europe. Mystery and miracle plays had
begun to be performed and to attract great attention. In the fourteenth
century religious pageants were added. "All art was still religion," but
an art was unmistakably arising amid cathedral-building and the setting-
forth of the Christian mysteries, and before long this was to flower in
modern forms of expression in painting, sculpture, and the drama.

THE NEW SPIRIT OF NATIONALITY. The new spirit moving in western Europe
also found expression in the evolution of the modern European States,
based on the new national feeling. As the kingly power in these was
consolidated, the developing States, each in its own domain, began to curb
the dominion of the universal Church, slowly to deprive it of the
governmental functions it had assumed and exercised for so long, and to
confine the Pope and clergy more and more to their original functions as
religious agents. The Papacy as a temporal power passed the maximum period
of its greatness early in the thirteenth century; in the nineteenth
century the last vestiges of its temporal power were taken away.

New national languages also were coming into being, and the national epics
of the people--the Cid, the Arthurian Legends, the _Chansons_, and the
_Nibelungen Lied_--were reduced to writing. With the introduction from the
East, toward the close of the thirteenth century, of the process of making
paper for writing, and with the increase of books in the vernacular, the
English, French, Spanish, Italian, and German languages rapidly took
shape. Their development was expressive of the new spirit in western
Europe, as also was the fact that Dante (1264-1321), "the first literary
layman since Boethius" (d. 524), wrote his great poem, _The Divine
Comedy_, in his native Italian instead of in the Latin which he knew so
well--an evidence of independence of large future import. New native
literatures were springing forth all over Europe. Beginning with the
_troubadours_ in southern France (p. 186), and taken up by the _trouvères_
in northern France and by the _minnesingers_ in German lands, the new
poetry of nature and love and joy of living had spread everywhere. [1] A
new race of men was beginning to "sing songs as blithesome and gay as the
birds" and to express in these songs the joys of the world here below.

TRANSFORMATION OF THE MEDIAEVAL MAN. The fourteenth century was a period
of still more rapid change and transformation. New objects of interest
were coming to the front, and new standards of judgment were being
applied. National spirit and a national patriotism were finding
expression. The mediaeval man, with his feeling of personal
insignificance, lack of self-confidence, "no sense of the past behind him,
and no conception of the possibilities of the future before him," [2] was
rapidly giving way to the man possessed of the modern spirit--the man of
self-confidence, conscious of his powers, enjoying life, feeling his
connection with the historic past, and realizing the potentialities of
accomplishment in the world here below. It was the great work of the
period of transition, and especially of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, to effect this change, "to awaken in man a consciousness of his
powers, to give him confidence in himself, to show him the beauty of the
world and the joy of life, and to make him feel his living connection with
the past and the greatness of the future he might create." [3] As soon as
men began clearly to experience such feelings, they began to inquire, and
inquiry led to the realization that there had been a great historic past
of which they knew but little, and of which they wanted to know much. When
this point had been reached, western Europe was ready for a revival of
learning.

THE BEGINNINGS IN ITALY. This revival began in Italy. The Italians had
preserved more of the old Roman culture than had any other people, and had
been the first to develop a new political and social order and revive the
refinements of life after the deluge of barbarism which had engulfed
Europe. They, too, had been the first to feel the inadequacy of mediaeval
learning to satisfy the intellectual unrest of men conscious of new
standards of life. This gave them at least a century of advance over the
nations of northern Europe. The old Roman life also was nearer to them,
and meant more, so that a movement for a revival of interest in it
attracted to it the finest young minds of central and northern Italy and
inspired in them something closely akin to patriotic fervor. They felt
themselves the direct heirs of the political and intellectual eminence of
Imperial Rome, and they began the work of restoring to themselves and of
trying to understand their inheritance.

[Illustration: FIG. 68. PETRARCH (1304-74)
"The Morning Star of the Renaissance"]

In Petrarch (1304-74) we have the beginnings of the movement. He has been
called "the first modern scholar and man of letters." Repudiating the
other-worldliness ideal and the scholastic learning of his time, [4]
possessed of a deep love for beauty in nature and art, a delight in
travel, a desire for worldly fame, a strong historical sense, and the
self-confidence to plan a great constructive work, he began the task of
unearthing the monastic treasures to ascertain what the past had been and
known and done. At twenty-nine he made his first great discovery, at
Liège, in the form of two previously unknown orations of Cicero. Twelve
years later, at Verona, he found half of one of the letters of Cicero
which had been lost for ages. All his life he collected and copied
manuscripts. His letter to a friend telling him of his difficulty in
getting a work of Cicero copied, and his joy in doing the work himself (R.
125), is typical of his labors. He began the work of copying and comparing
the old classical manuscripts, and from them reconstructing the past. He
also wrote many sonnets, ballads, lyrics, and letters, all filled with a
new modern classical spirit. He also constructed the first modern map of
Italy.

[Illustration: FIG. 69. BOCCACCIO (1313-75)
"The Father of Italian Prose"]

Through Boccaccio, whom he first met in 1350, Petrarch's work was made
known in Florence, then the wealthiest and most artistic and literary city
in the world, [5] and there the new knowledge and method were warmly
received. Boccaccio equaled Petrarch in his passion for the ancient
writers, hunting for them wherever he thought they might be found. One of
his pupils has left us a melancholy picture of the library at Monte
Cassino, as Boccaccio found it at the time of his visit (R. 126). He wrote
a book of popular tales and romances, filled with the modern spirit, which
made him the father of Italian prose as Dante was of Italian poetry;
prepared the first dictionaries of classical geography and Greek
mythology; and was the first western scholar to learn Greek.

  "In the dim light of learning's dawn they stand,
  Flushed with the first glimpses of a long-lost land."

A CENTURY OF RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION. The work done by these two
friends in discovering and editing was taken up by others, and during the
century (1333-1433) dating from the first great "find" of Petrarch the
principal additions to Latin literature were made. The monasteries and
castles of Europe were ransacked in the hope of discovering something new,
or more accurate copies of previously known books. At monasteries and
churches as widely separated as Monte Cassino, near Naples: Lodi, near
Milan; Milan, itself; and Vercelli, in Italy: Saint Gall and other
monasteries, in Switzerland: Paris; Cluny, near the present city of Macon;
Langres, near the source of the Marne; and monasteries in the Vosges
Mountains, in France: Corvey, in Westphalia; and Hersfeld, Cologne, and
Mainz in Germany--important finds were made. [6] Thus widely had the old
Latin authors been scattered, copied, and forgotten. In a letter to a
friend (R. 127 a) the enthusiast, Poggio Bracciolini, tells of finding
(1416) the long-lost _Institutes of Oratory_ of Quintilian, at Saint Gall,
and of copying it for posterity. This, and the reply of his friend (R. 127
b), reveal something of the spirit and the emotions of those engaged in
the recovery of Latin literature and the reconstruction of Roman history.

The finds, though, while important, were after all of less value than the
spirit which directed the search, or the careful work which was done in
collecting, comparing, questioning, inferring, criticizing, and editing
corrected texts, and reconstructing old Roman life and history. [7] We
have in this new work a complete break with scholastic methods, and we see
in it the awakening of the modern scientific spirit. [8] It was this same
critical, constructive spirit which, when applied later to Christian
practices, brought on the Reformation; when applied to the problems of the
universe, revealed to men the wonderful world of science; and when applied
to problems of government, led to the questioning of the theory of the
divine right of kings, and to the evolution of democracy. We have here a
modern spirit, a craving for truth for its own sake, an awakening of the
historical sense, [9] and an appreciation of beauty in literature and
nature which was soon to be followed by an appreciation of beauty in art.
A worship of classical literature and classical ideas now set in, of which
rich and prosperous Florence became the center, with Venice and Rome, as
well as a number of the northern Italian cities, as centers of more than
minor importance.

THE REVIVAL OF GREEK IN THE WEST. With the new interest in Latin
literature it was but natural that a revival of the study of Greek should
follow. While a knowledge of Greek had not absolutely died out in the West
during the Middle Ages, there were very few scholars who knew anything
about it, and none who could read it. [10] It was natural, too, that the
revival of it should come first in Italy. Southern Italy (_Magna Graecia_)
had remained under the Eastern Empire and Greek until its conquest by the
Normans (1041-71), and to southern Italy a few Greek monks had from time
to time migrated. With southern Italy, though, papal Italy and the western
Christian world seem to have had little contact. In 1339, and again in
1342, a Greek monk from southern Italy visited the Pope, coming as an
ambassador from Constantinople, and from him Petrarch learned the Greek
alphabet. In 1353 another envoy brought Petrarch a copy of Homer. This he
could not read, but in time (1367) a poor translation into Latin was
effected. Boccaccio studied Greek, being the first western scholar to read
Homer in the original.

Near the end of the fourteenth century it became known in Florence that
Manuel Chrysoloras (c. 1350-1415), a Byzantine of noble birth, a teacher
of rhetoric and philosophy at Constantinople, and the most accomplished
Greek scholar of his age, had arrived in Venice as an envoy from the
Eastern Emperor. Florentine scholars visited him, and on his return
accompanied him to Constantinople to learn Greek. In 1396 Chrysoloras was
invited by Florence to accept an appointment, in the university there, to
the first chair of Greek letters in the West, and accepted. From 1396 to
1400 he taught Greek in the rich and stately city of Florence, at that
time the intellectual and artistic center of Christendom. For a few years,
beginning in 1402, he also taught Greek at the University of Pavia. He had
earlier written a _Catechism of Greek Grammar_, and at Pavia he began a
literal rendering of Plato's _Republic_ into Latin. From his visit dates
the enthusiasm for the study of Greek in the West.

OTHER GREEK SCHOLARS ARRIVE IN ITALY. Chrysoloras returned to
Constantinople for a time, in 1403, and Guarino of Verona, who had been
one of his pupils, accompanied him and spent five years there as a member
of his household. When he returned to Italy he brought with him about
fifty manuscripts, and before his death he had translated a number of them
into Latin. He also prepared a Greek grammar which superseded that of
Chrysoloras. In 1412 he was elected to the chair at Florence formerly held
by Chrysoloras, and later he established an important school at Ferrara,
based largely on instruction in the Latin and Greek classics, which will
be referred to again in the next chapter.

A rage for Greek learning and Greek books now for a time set in. Aurispa,
a Sicilian, went to Constantinople, learned Greek, and returned to Italy,
in 1422, with 238 Greek manuscripts. Messer Filelfo, of Padua, after seven
years at Constantinople, returned, in 1427, with forty manuscripts and
with the grand-niece of Chrysoloras as his wife. In 1448 Theodorus Gaza
(c. 1400-75), a learned Greek from the city of Thessalonica, who had fled
from his native city just before its capture by the Turks (1430), came to
Ferrara as the first professor of Greek in the university there. He made
many translations, prepared a very popular Greek grammar, and in 1451
became professor of philosophy at Rome.

Another Greek of importance was Demetrius Chalcondyles of Athens (1424-
1511), who reached Italy in 1447. In 1450 he became professor of Greek at
Perugia, and of his lectures there one of his enthusiastic pupils [11]
wrote:

    A Greek has just arrived, who has begun to teach me with great pains,
    and I to listen to his precepts with incredible pleasure, because he
    is a Greek, because he is an Athenian, and because he is Demetrius. It
    seems to me that in him is figured all the wisdom, the civility, and
    the elegance of those so famous and illustrious ancients. Merely
    seeing him you fancy you are looking on Plato; far more when you hear
    him speak.

In 1463 Demetrius transferred to Padua as professor of Greek, and was the
first professor of Greek in a western European university to be paid a
fixed salary. He also taught for a time at Milan, and from 1471 to 1491
was professor of Greek at Florence.

A number of other learned Greeks had reached Italy prior to the fall of
Constantinople (1453) before the advancing Turks, [12] and after its fall
many more sought there a new home. Many of these found, on landing, that
their knowledge of Greek and the possession of a few Greek books were an
open sesame to the learned circles of Italy.

walls of the church of Santa Maria Novella, at Florence)]

ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NEW MOVEMENT; LIBRARIES AND ACADEMICS FOUNDED. The
enthusiasm for the recovery and restoration of ancient literature and
history which this work awakened among the younger scholars of Italy can
be imagined. While most of the professors in the universities and most of
the church officials at first had nothing to do with the new movement,
being wedded to scholastic methods of thinking, the leaders of the new
learning drew about them many of the brightest and most energetic of the
young men who came to those universities which were hospitable to the new
movement. [13] Greek scholars in the university towns were followed by
admiring bands of younger students, [14] who soon took up the work and
superseded their masters. Academies, named after the one conducted by
Plato in the groves near Athens, whose purpose was to promote literary
studies, were founded in all the important Italian cities (R. 129). The
members usually Latinized their names, and celebrated the ancient
festivals. In Venice a Greek Academy was formed in which all the
proceedings were in Greek, and the members were known by Greek names. The
_Academia of Aldus_, at Venice, of which his celebrated press was a
department, became a veritable university for classical learning, and to
participate in its proceedings scholars came from many lands. It was the
curious and enthusiastic Italians who, more than the Greek scholars who
taught them the language, opened up the literature and history of Athens
to the comprehension of the western world.

The financial support of the movement came from the wealthy merchant
princes, reigning dukes, and a few church authorities, who assisted
scholars and spent money most liberally in collecting manuscripts and
accumulating books. Says Symonds:

    Never was there a time in the world's history when money was spent
    more freely upon the collection and preservation of MSS., and when a
    more complete machinery was put in motion for the sake of securing
    literary treasures. Prince vied with prince, and eminent burgher with
    burgher, in buying books. The commercial correspondents of the Medici
    and other great Florentine houses, whose banks and discount offices
    extended over Europe and the Levant, were instructed to purchase
    relics of antiquity without regard for cost, and to forward them to
    Florence. The most acceptable present that could be sent to a king was
    a copy of a Roman historian. The best credentials which a young Greek
    arriving from Byzantium could use to gain the patronage of men like
    Palla degli Strozzi was a fragment of some ancient; the merchandise
    insuring the largest profit to a speculator who had special knowledge
    in such matters was old parchment covered with crabbed characters.
    [15]

Cosimo de' Medici (1393-1464), a banker and ruler of Florence, spent great
sums in collecting and copying manuscripts. Vespasiano, a fifteenth-
century bookseller of Florence, has left us an interesting picture of the
work of Cosimo in founding (1444) the great Medicean library [16] at
Florence (R. 130) and of the difficulties of book collecting in the days
before the invention of printing.

[Illustration: FIG. 71. BOOKCASE AND DESK IN THE MEDICEAN LIBRARY AT
FLORENCE
(Drawn from a photograph)
This library was founded in 1444. It contains to-day about 10,000 Greek
and Latin manuscripts, many of them very rare, and of a few the only
copies known. The building was designed by Michael Angelo, and its
construction was begun in 1525. The bookcases are of about this date. It
shows the early method of chaining books to the shelves, and cataloguing
the volumes on the end of each stack.]

Under Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent, who died in 1492, two
expeditions were sent to Greece to obtain manuscripts for the Florentine
library. Vespasiano also describes for us the books collected (c. 1475-80)
for the great ducal library at Urbino (R. 131), the greatest library in
the Christian world at the time of its completion, and the work of Pope
Nicholas V [17] (1447-1455) in laying the foundations (1450) for the great
Vatican Library at Rome (R. 132). Nicholas was an enthusiast in the new
movement, and formed a plan for the translation of all the Greek writers
into Latin. A later Pope, Leo X (1513-1521), planned to make Rome the
international center for Greek learning.

THE MOVEMENT EXTENDS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. Petrarch made his first great
find in 1333, and up to 1450 the Revival of Learning, often termed the
Renaissance, was entirely an Italian movement. By that date the great work
in Italy had been done, and the Italians were once more in possession of
the literature and history of the past. With them the movement was
literary, historical, and patriotic in purpose and spirit. With them the
movement was known as _humanism_, from an old Roman word (_humanitas_)
meaning culture, and this term came to be applied to the new studies in
all other lands. In their work with the literatures, inscriptions, coins,
and archaeological remains of the Greeks and Romans, their own literature,
history, mythology, and political and social life was reconstructed. The
methods employed were the methods used in modern science, and the result
was to develop in Italy a new type of scholar, possessed of a literary,
artistic, and historical appreciation unknown since the days of ancient
Rome, and with the greatest enthusiasm for Latin as a living language.

By the time the revival had culminated in Italy it began to be heard of
north of the Alps. France was the first country to take up the study of
Greek, a professorship being established at Paris in 1458. There was but
little interest in the subject, however, or in any of the new studies,
until two events of political importance, forty years later, brought
Frenchmen in close touch with what had been done in northern Italy. In
1494 Charles VIII, of France, claiming Naples as his possession, took an
army into Italy, and forcibly occupied Rome and Florence. Four years later
his successor, Louis XII, claimed Milan also and seized it and Naples,
maintaining a French court at Milan from 1498 to 1512. Though both these
expeditions were unsuccessful, from a political point of view, the effect
of the direct contact with humanism in its home was lasting. New ideas in
architecture, art, and learning were carried back to France, French
scholars traveled to Italy, and early in the sixteenth century Paris
became a center for the new humanistic studies. In Greek, France
completely superseded Italy as the interpreter of Greek life and
literature to the modern world.

In 1473 a Spanish scholar, Mebrissensis (1444-1522), returned home after
twenty years in Italy and introduced Greek at Seville, Salamanca, and
Alcalà.

THOMAS LINACRE (c. 1460-1524) English Professor of Medicine
and Lecturer on Greek (From a portrait in the British Museum)]

About 1488 Thomas Linacre (c. 1460-1524) and William Grocyn (1446-1514),
two Oxford graduates, went to Florence from England, studying Greek under
Demetrius Chalcondyles, and, returning, introduced the new learning at
Oxford. [18] Linacre, as professor of medicine, translated much of Galen
(p. 198) from the Greek, and he and Grocyn lectured on Greek at the
University. From Oxford the new learning was transmitted to Cambridge,
and, over a century afterward, to Harvard in America. A third Oxford man
to study Greek in Italy was John Colet (1467-1519), who studied in
Florence from 1493 to 1496, and returned home an enthusiastic humanist. He
was the first Englishman to attract much attention to the new studies, and
to him is chiefly due their introduction into the English secondary
school.

The first German of whom we have any record as having studied in Italy was
Peter Luder (c. 1415-74), who returned in 1456, and lectured on the new
learning at the Universities of Heidelberg, Erfurt, and Leipzig, but
awakened no response. In 1470 Johann Wessel (1420-89) and in 1476 Rodolph
Agricola (1443-85), two noted Dutch scholars, studied in Italy. On
returning, Agricola, [19] who has been called "the Petrarch of German
lands," did much "to spread the great inheritance of antiquity and the new
civilization to which it had given birth among his uncouth countrymen"
(_barbari_, he calls them). He made Heidelberg, for a time, a center of
humanistic appreciation. Johann Reuchlin (1455-1522), a German by birth,
studied in Florence and elsewhere in Italy in 1481 to 1490, and there
learned Hebrew. Returning, he became a professor at Heidelberg and the
father of modern Hebrew studies. In 1506 he published the first Hebrew
grammar. In 1493 the University of Erfurt established a professorship of
Poetry and Eloquence, this being the first German university to
countenance the new learning. In 1523 the first chair of Greek was
established at Vienna. Thus slowly did the revival of learning spread to
northern lands.

THE REVIVAL AIDED BY THE INVENTION OF PAPER AND PRINTING. Very fortunately
for the spread of the new learning an important process and a great
invention now came in at a most opportune time. The process was the
manufacture of paper; the invention that of printing.

The manufacture of paper is probably a Chinese invention, early obtained
by the Arabs. During the Mohammedan occupation of Spain paper mills were
set up there, and a small supply of their paper found its way across the
Pyrenees. The Christians who drove the Mohammedans out lost the process,
and it now came back once more from the East. By about 1250 the Greeks had
obtained the process from Mohammedan sources, and in 1276 the first paper
mill was set up in Italy. In 1340 a paper factory was established at
Padua, and soon thereafter other factories began to make paper at
Florence, Bologna, Milan, and Venice. In 1320 a paper factory was
established at Mainz, in Germany, and in 1390 another at Nuremberg. By
1450 paper was in common use and the way was now open for one of the
world's greatest inventions.

This was the invention of printing. From the difficulty experienced in
securing books for the great libraries at Florence, Urbino, and Rome, as
we have seen (Rs. 130, 131, 132), and the great cost of reproducing single
copies of books, we can see that the work of the humanists of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Italy probably would have had but
little influence elsewhere but for the invention of printing. To
disseminate a new learning involving two great literatures by copying
books, one at a time by hand, would have prevented instruction in the new
subjects becoming general for centuries, and would have materially
retarded the progress of the world. The discovery of the art of printing,
coming when it did, scattered the new learning over Europe.

setting type, and the one at the lever is making an impression. A number
of four-page printed sheets are seen on the table at the right of the
press.]

SPREAD AND WORK OF THE PRESS. The dates connected with this new invention
and its diffusion over Europe are:

    1423. Coster of Harlem made the first engraved single page.
    1438. Gutenberg invented movable wooden types.
    1450. Schoeffer and Faust cast first metal type.
    1456. Bible printed in Latin by Gutenberg and Faust at Mainz. This the
          first complete book printed. [20]
    1457. The Mayence Psalter, the first dated book, printed. [21]
    1462. Adolph of Nassau pillaged Mainz, drove out the printers, and in
          consequence scattered the art over Europe.
    1465. Press set up in the German monastery of Subiaco, in the Sabine
          Mountains, in Italy.
    1467. This press moved to Rome.
    1469. Presses at Paris and Vienna.
    1470. Printing introduced into Switzerland.
    1471. Presses set up at Florence, Milan, and Ferrara.
    1473. Printing introduced into Holland and Belgium.
    1474. Printing introduced into Spain.
    1474-77. Printing introduced into England. Caxton set up his press in
          1477.
    1476. First book printed in Greek at Milan.
    1490. The Aldine press established at Venice, by Aldus Manutius.
    1501. First Greek book printed in Germany, at Erfurt.
    1563. First newspaper established, in Venice.

Inventions traveled but slowly in those days, yet in time the press was to
be found in every country of Europe. The professional copyists made a
great outcry against the innovation; presses were at first licensed and
closely limited in number; in France the University of Paris was given the
proceeds of a tax levied on all books printed; and in England the
beginnings of the modern copyright are to be seen in the necessity of
obtaining a license from the ecclesiastical authorities to be permitted to
print a book.

[Illustration: FIG. 74. AN EARLY SPECIMEN OF CAXTON'S PRINTING]

In cutting and casting the first type a style of heavy-faced letter, much
like that written by the mediaeval monks--the so-called _Gothic_--was
used. Caxton, in England, used this at first, and the Germans have
continued its use up to the present time. The Italians, however, soon
devised a type with letters like those used by the old Romans--the so-
called Roman type, this type which was soon accepted in all non-German
European countries. The Italians also devised a compressed type--the
_Italic_--which enabled printers to get more words on a page.

Venice, almost from the first, became the center of the book trade, and
books literally poured from the presses there. By 1500 as many as five
thousand editions, often of as many as a thousand copies to an edition,
had been printed in Italy. [22] Of this number 2835 had been printed in
Venice, and most of them by the Aldine press of Aldus Manutius, and edited
by the _Academia_ (p. 250) connected therewith. [23] By 1500 many books
had also been printed in a number of northern cities, [24] and Lyons,
Paris, Basel, Nuremberg, Cologne, Leipzig, and London soon became centers
of the northern book trade. Caxton in England soon vied with Aldus in
Venice as a printer of beautiful books. When we remember that it required
fifty-three days (Sandys) to make by hand one copy of Quintilian's
_Institutes_, and forty-five copyists twenty-two months to reproduce two
hundred volumes for the Medicean Library at Florence (R. 130), the
enormous importance of an invention which would print rapidly a thousand
or more copies of a book, all exactly alike and free from copyist errors,
can be appreciated. It tremendously cheapened books, [25] made the
general use of the textbook method of teaching possible, and paved the way
for a great extension of schools and learning (R. 134). From now on the
press became a formidable rival to the pulpit and the sermon, and one of
the greatest of instruments for human progress and individual liberty.
From this time on educational progress was to be much more rapid than it
had been in the past. From an educational point of view the invention of
printing might almost be taken as marking the close of the mediaeval and
the beginning of modern times.

RISE OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERY. The new influences awakened by the Revival
of Learning found expression in other directions. One of these was
geographical discovery, itself an outgrowth of that series of movements
known as the _Crusades_, with the accompanying revival of trade and
commerce. These led to travel, exploration, and discovery. By the latter
part of the thirteenth century the most extensive travel which had taken
place since the days of ancient Rome had begun, and in the next two and a
half centuries a great expansion of the known world took place.

[Illustration: FIG. 75. THE WORLD AS KNOWN TO CHRISTIAN EUROPE BEFORE
COLUMBUS]

Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville made extended travels to the Orient,
and returning (Polo returned, 1295) described to a wondering Europe the
new lands and peoples they had seen. The _Voyages_ of Polo and the
_Travels_ of Mandeville were widely read. By the beginning of the
fourteenth century the compass had been perfected, in Naples, and a great
era of exploration had been begun. In 1402 venturesome sailors, out beyond
the "Pillars of Hercules," discovered the Canary Islands; in 1419 the
Madeira Islands were reached; in 1460 the Cape Verde Islands were found;
in 1497 Bartholomew Diaz rounded the southern tip of Africa; and in 1497
Vasco da Gama discovered the long-hoped-for sea route to India. Five years
later, sailing westward with the same end in view, Columbus discovered the
American continent. Finally, in 1519-22, Magellan's ships circumnavigated
the globe, and, returning safely to Spain, proved that the world was
round. In 1507 Waldenseemüller published his _Introduction to Geography_,
a book that was widely read, and one which laid the foundations of this
modern study.

The effect of these discoveries in broadening the minds of men can be
imagined. Good-by! So long!

The Ancient Lays

I cannot sing the old songs I sang long years ago, But I can always hear
them At any vodevil show.

Erring in Company
("If I have erred I err in company with Abraham Lincoln."--THEODORE
ROOSEVELT.)
If e'er my rhyming be at fault, If e'er I chance to scribble dope, If
that my metre ever halt, I err in company with Pope.

An that my grammar go awry, An that my English be askew, Sooth, I can prove
an alibi-- The Bard of Avon did it, too.

If often toward the bottled grape My errant fancy fondly turns, Remember,
jeering jackanape, I err in company with Burns.

If now and then I sigh "Mine own!" Unto another's wedded wife, Remember
I am not alone-- Hast ever read Lord Byron's Life?

If frequently I fret and fume, And absolutely will not smile, I err
in company with Hume, Old Socrates and T. Carlyle.

If e'er I fail in etiquette, And foozle on The Proper Stuff Regarding
manners, don't forget A. Tennyson's were pretty tough.

Eke if I err upon the side Of talking overmuch of Me, I err, it cannot
be denied, In most illustrious company.

The Limit

While I hold as superficial him who has his young initial Neatly graven
on his Turkish cigarette, Such a bit of affectation I can view with
toleration, Such a folly I forgive and I forget.
Him who rocks the little boat, or him who rides the cyclemotor I dislike
a little more than just enough; But you might as well be knowing that the
guy who gets me going Is the man who wears his kerchief in his cuff.

Now I've builded many a verse on that extremely stylish person Who
insists upon the hat of emerald hue; I have made a lot of fun of things
that honestly were none of My blanked business--and I knew that it was
true.
At the shameless subway smoker I have been a ceaseless joker---- For that
nuisance daily gets me in a huff-- But the one that makes me maddest
is that pestilential faddist Who is carrying his kerchief in his
cuff.

I'm a passive, harmless hater of the vari-coloured gaiter That the
men of the Rialto will affect; Of the loud and sassy clother, I'm
a quiet, modest loather, And to comic section weskits I object.

But, as I have intimated, hinted, innuendoed stated, Of the things
that I believe are awful stuff, Nothing starts my indignation like
the silly affectation Of the man who wears his kerchief in his
cuff---- E-nough!

Of the man who wears his kerchief in his cuff.

Chorus for Mixed Voices
(Being a stenographic report of how it sounds from the piazza when a
dozen boat loads go out on the lake of a summer evening.)

How can I bear to good old Yale the shades of Upidee That's where my
heart is weep no more in sunny Tennessee How dear to heart grows
weary far from meadow grass is blue Above Cayuga's waters we will
sing I'm strong for you.

A Spanish cava fare thee well and everything so fine That's where you get
your old black Joe my darling Clementine The old folks would enjoy
it on the road to Mandalay 'Twas from Aunt Dinah's polly-wolly-woodle
all the day.

I hear those good night ladies much obliged because we're here
Afraid to go home in the with a good song ringing clear Just tell
them that fair Harvard old Nassau is shining bright How can I bear
to grand old rag we roll along good night!

The Translated Way

(Being a "lyric" translation of Heine's "Du Bist Wie Eine Blume," as it is
usually done.)

Thou art like to a Flower, So pure and clean thou art; I view thee and
much Sadness Steals to me in the Heart.

To me it seems my Hands I Should now impose on your Head, praying God to
keep you So fine and clean and pure.

"And Yet It Is A Gentle Art!"
(Parody is a genre frowned upon by your professors of literature...
And yet it is a gentle art-- "The Point of View" in May _Scribner's_.)

A sweet disorder in the verse That never looks behind Shall profit not who
steals my purse, Let joy be unconfined!

How vainly men themselves amaze!
The stars began to blink, An art that there were few to praise, Nor any
drop to drink.

O sleep, it is a blessed thing Which I must ne'er enjoy!
There never was a fairer spring Than when I was a boy.

One fond embrace and then we part!
Good--by, my lover, good-by!
And yet it is a gentle art, Which nobody can deny.

Occasionally

Now and then there's a couple whose conjugal life Is happy as happy
can be; Now and then there's a man who believes that his wife Is
the One Unsurpassable She; There are doubtless in England a great
many folks Whose humour is airy and sage; But there never is one
in American jokes Or on the American stage
Now and then there's an auto that doesn't break down, Or an angler
who catches some fish; Now and then there's a pretty society gown
Or a girl that breaks never a dish; There is haply a Croesus who
isn't a hoax.

Or a jest that's not hoary with age; But there never is one in American
jokes Or on the American stage.

Now and then there's a poet with closely cropped hair, Or a sporting
man quiet in dress; Now and then there's a lady from Boston who's
fair, Now and then there's a fetterless press; Now and then there's
a laugh that a jester may coax, A librettist may put on his page--
But they're terribly rare in American jokes, And--oh, the American
stage!

Jim and Bill

Bill Jones was cynical and sad; He thought sincerity was rare; Most
people, Bill believed, were bad And few were fair.

He said that cheating was the rule; That nearly everything was fake; That
nearly all, both knave and fool, Were on the make.

Jim Brown was cheerful as the sun; He thought the world a lovely
place, Exhibiting to every one A smiling face.

He thought that every man was fair; He had no cause to sob or sigh; He said
that everything was square As any die.

Dear reader, would you rather be Like Jim, not crediting the ill,
Joyous in your serenity, Or right, like Bill?

When Nobody Listens
_At not at all infrequent spells I hear--and so do you-- The tales
that everybody tells And no one listens to._
"You talk about excitement.

  Well Last summer, up at Silver Dell, Jim Brown

  When we left shore the sun was out-- Serenest day, beyond a doubt,
      I ever saw. When suddenly It thunders, and a
      heavy sea Comes up. 'I'm goin'

Office Mottoes
  
Motto heartening, inspiring, Framed above my pretty *desk, Never Shelley,
    Keats, or Byring*
  Penned a phrase so picturesque!
But in me no inspiration Rides my low and prosy brow-- All I
  think of is vacation When I see that lucubration:
  

    DO IT NOW
  
  When I see another sentence Framed upon a brother's wall,
Resolution and repentance Do not flood o'er me at all As I read
that nugatory Counsel written years ago, Only when one comes to
borry[Footnote: Entered under the Pure License of 1906.]

Do I heed that ancient story:

TELL HIM NO
Mottoes flat and mottoes silly, Proverbs void of point or wit, "KEEP
A-PLUGGIN' WHEN IT'S HILLY!"

"LIFE'S A TIGER: CONQUER IT!"

Office mottoes make me weary And of all the bromide bunch There is only one
I seri- Ously like, and that's the cheery:

GONE TO LUNCH

Metaphysics

A man morose and dull and sad-- Go ask him why he feels so bad.
Behold! He answers it is drink That put his nerves upon the blink.

Another man whose smile and jest Disclose a nature of the best-- What
keeps his heart and spirit up?
Again we learn it is the cup.

The moral to this little bit Is anything you make of it.
Such recondite philosophy Is far away too much for me.

Heads and Tails

If a single man is studious and quiet, people say He is grouchy, he is
old before his time; If he's frivolous and flippant, if he treads the
primrose way, Then they mark him for a wild career of crime.

If a man asserts that So-and-So is beautiful or sweet, He is daffy on the
proposition, Girl; If he's weary in the evening and he keeps his subway
seat, He's immediately branded as a churl.

If he buys a friend a rickey not for any special cause, He is captain of
the lush-and-spendthrift squad; If, before he spends a million, he
will think a bit and pause, There's a popular impression he's a wad.

If a man attends to business and looks to every chance, He is mercenary,
money-mad, and coarse; If he thinks of art and letters more than
personal finance, He is lacking in ambition and in force.

If a man but bats his consort oh-so-gently on the head, If he throttles
her a little round the neck, He's a brute; if he's considerately conjugal
instead, Everybody calls him Mr. Henry Peck.

Lowers Scylla--frowns Charybdis--and the bark is like to sink-- This the
symbolistic moral of my rhyme-- If Opinion trims your sails and if you
care what people think You will have a most unhappy sort of time.

An Election Night Pantoum

Gaze at the good-natured crowd, List to the noise and the rattle!

Heavens! that woman is loud-- Loud as the din of a
battle.

List to the noise and the rattle!

Hark to the honk of the horn Loud as the din of a battle!
There! My new overcoat's torn!

Hark to the honk of the horn!
Cut out that throwing confetti!
There! My new overcoat's torn-- Looks like a shred of spaghetti.

Cut out that throwing confetti!
Look at the gentleman, stewed; Looks like a shred of spaghetti-- Don't
get so terribly rude!

Look at the gentleman, stewed!
Look at the glare of the rocket!
Don't get so terribly rude, Keep your hand out of my pocket!

Look at the glare of the rocket!
Take that thing out of my face!
Keep your hand out of my pocket!
This is a shame and disgrace.

Take that thing out of my face!
Curse you! Be decent to ladies!
This is a shame and disgrace, Worse than traditions of Hades.

Curse you! Be decent to ladies!
(Heavens! that woman is loud.) Worse than traditions of Hades Gaze at the
"good-natured" crowd!

I Cannot Pay That Premium

Beside a frugal table, though spotless clean and white, A loving couple
they did sit and all seemed pleasant, quite; They did not have no servant
the things away to take, For he was but a broker who much money did not
make.

(Key changes to minor.)
He lit a fifty-cent cigar and then his wife did say:
"Your life insurance it will lapse if it you do not pay."

He turned from her in sorrow, for breaking was his heart, And in a
mezzo barytone to her did say, in part:

CHORUS:
"I cannot pay that premium, I'll have to let it go; It fills me
with remorse and sorrow, not to mention woe.

Though I'm quite strong and
healthy, and will outlive you, perhaps, I cannot pay that premium; I'll
have to let it lapse."

The wife she naught did answer,
for it cut her to the quick; She washed the dishes, filled the
lamp, and likewise trimmed the wick; She took in washing the next
day and played bridge whist all night, Until she had enough to pay
her husband's premium, quite.

(Key changes to minor)
The husband he was thrown next day from his au-to-mo-bile, And although
rather lonesome it did make his widow feel, It made her glad to know that
she had paid that prem-i-um, And oftentimes in after years these words
she'd softly hum:

CHORUS:

"I cannot pay that premium," etc.

Three Authors

Prolific authors, noble three, I do my derby off to ye.

_Selected_, dear old chap, who knows The quantity of verse and prose
That you have signed in all these years!
You've dulled how many thousand shears!
You've filled, at a tremendous rate, A million miles of "boiler plate"-- A
wreath of laurel for your brow!
A stirrup-cup to you--here's how!

And you, dear _Ibid_. Ah, you wrote Too many things for me to quote, Though
Bartlett, of quotation fame, Plays up your unpoetic name More than he did
to Avon's bard.
Your stuff's on every page, old pard.
Bouquets to you the writer flings; You wrote a lot of dandy things.

And you, O last, O greatest one, A word with you, and I have done Your,
dear _Exchange_, that ever floats Around with verses, anecdotes, And jokes.
Oh, what a lot you sign (Quite frequently a thing of mine).
Why, it would not be very strange If I should see this signed--_Exchange_.

O favourite authors, wondrous three, I do my derby off to ye!

To Quotation
(Caused by "The Ethics of Misquotation" in the November _Atlantic
Monthly_.)
Quotation! Brother to the Arts, assister to the Muse!
When Bartlett from his study height unfurled thine heaven-born hues,
The quotes were here, the quotes were there, the quotes were all
around, For Bartlett like a poultice came to blow the heels of
sound.
Pernicious habit! One becomes a worse than senseless block, A bard
that no one dares to praise and fewer care to knock; A sentence by
a mossy stone, of quaint and curious lore, An apt quotation is to
one and it is nothing more.
Quotation! Ah, thou droppest as the gentle rain from heaven, Thy
brow is wet with honest sweat and the stars on thy head are seven.
Who steals my verse steals trash, for, soothly, he who runs may
read, But he who filches from me Bartlett leaves me poor indeed.
I fill this cup to Bartlett up, and may he rest in peace-- From
Afric's sunny fountains to the happy Isles of Greece.
Quotation! O my Rod and Staff, my Joy sans let or end With me abide,
O handy guide, philosopher, and friend.

Melodrama 
R
If you want a receipt for a melodramatical, Thrillingly thundery,
popular show, Take an old father, unyielding, emphatical, Driving
his daughter out into the snow; The love of a hero, courageous and
Hacketty; Hate of a villain in evening clothes; Comic relief that
is Irish and racketty; Schemes of a villainess muttering oaths; The
bank and the safe and the will and the forgery-- All of them built
on traditional norms-- Villainess dark and Lucrezia Borgery Helping
the villain until she reforms; The old mill at midnight, a rapid
delivery; Violin music, all scary and shivery; Plot that is devilish,
awful, nefarious; Heroine frightened, her plight is precarious;
Bingo!--the rescue!--the movement goes snappily-- Exit the villain
and all endeth happily!
Take of these elements any you care about, Put 'em in Texas, the
Bowery, or thereabout; Put in the powder and leave out the grammar,
And the certain result is a swell melodrammer.
A Poor Excuse, But Our Own
(Why don't you ever write any child poetry?
--A MOTHER.)
My right-hand neighbour hath a child, A pretty child of five or
six, Not more than other children wild, Nor fuller than the rest
of tricks-- At five he rises, shine or rain, And noisily plays
"fire" or "train."
Likewise a girl, _aetatis_ eight, He hath. Each morning, as a rule,
Proudly my neighbour will relate How bright Mathilda is at school.
My ardour, less than half of mild, Bids me to comment, "Wondrous
child!"
All through the vernal afternoon My other neighbour's children skate
A wild Bacchantic rigadoon On rollers; nor does it abate Till dark;
and then his babies cry What time I fain would versify.
Did I but set myself to sing A children's song, I'd stand revealed
A bard that did the infant thing As well as Riley or 'Gene Field.
I could write famous Children Stuff, If they'd keep quiet long
enough.

A Word for It
"Scorn not the sonnet." Well, I reckon not, I would not scorn a
rondeau, villanelle, Ballade, sestina, triolet, rondel, Or e'en a
quatrain, humble and forgot, An so it made my Pegasus to trot His
morning lap what time he heard the bell; An so it made the poem
stuff to jell-- To mix a met.--an so it boil'd the pot.
Oh, sweet set form that varies not a bit!
I taste thy joy, not quite unknown to Keats.
"Scorn?" Nay, I love thy fine symmetric grace.Quintilian was the supreme authority on the purpose and method of teaching
(R. 25). Greek also was begun later, though studied much less extensively
and thoroughly. The Greek grammar of Theodorus Gaza (p. 248) was studied,
followed by the reading of Xenophon, Isocrates, Plutarch, and some of
Homer and Hesiod.

This thorough drill in ancient history and literature was given along with
careful attention to manners and moral training, and each pupil's health
was watchfully supervised--an absolutely new thought in the Christian
world. Such physical sports and games as fencing, wrestling, playing ball,
football, running, leaping, and dancing were also given special emphasis.
Competitive games between different schools were held, much as in modern
times.

The result was an all-round physical, mental, and moral training, vastly
superior to anything previously offered by the cathedral and other church
schools, and which at once established a new type which was widely copied.
A number of these new teachers, called _humanists_, wrote treatises on the
proper order of studies, the methods to be employed, the right education
of a prince, liberal education, and similar topics. [2] One of these,
Battista Guarino, describing the education provided in the school which
his father founded at Ferrara (R. 135), laid down a dictum which was
accepted widely until the middle of the nineteenth century, when he wrote:

    I have said that ability to write Latin verse is one of the essential
    marks of an educated person. I wish now to indicate a second, which is
    of at least equal importance, namely, familiarity with the literature
    and language of Greece. The time has come when we must speak in no
    uncertain voice upon this vital requirement of scholarship.

HUMANISM IN FRANCE. From Italy the new humanism was carried to France,
along with the retreating armies that had occupied Naples, Florence, and
Milan (p. 252), and when Francis I came to the French throne, in 1515, the
new learning found in him a willing patron. Though there had been
beginnings before this, the new learning really found a home in France now
for the first time. Here, too, it became associated with court and noble,
and the schools created to furnish this new instruction were provided at
the instigation of some form of public authority. The greatest humanistic
scholar in France at the time, Budaeus, was made royal librarian, in 1522.
His study of the old Roman coinage, upon which he spent nine years, would
pass to-day as a study representing a high grade of scholarship, and was
in marked contrast with the scholastic methods of the university. In his
writings Budaeus set forth for France the dictum that every man, even if
he be a king, should be devoted to letters and liberal learning, and that
this culture can be obtained only through Greek and Latin, and of these,
unlike the Italians, he held Greek to be the more important. Other
scholars now helped to transfer the center for Greek scholarship to Paris,
where it remained for the next two centuries.

[Illustration: FIG. 78. GUILLAUME BUDAEUS (1467-1540)]

A royal press was set up in Paris, in 1526, to promote the introduction of
the new learning. Libraries were built up, as in Italy. Humanist scholars
were made secretaries and ambassadors. The _College de France_ was
established at Paris, by direction of the King, with chairs in Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, and mathematics. To Hebrew the Italians had given almost no
attention, but in France, and particularly in Germany, Hebrew became an
important study. The development of schools in northern France was
hindered by the dissensions following the religious revolts of Luther and
Calvin, but in southern France many of the cities founded municipal
colleges, much like the court schools of northern Italy in type. The work
of the city of Bordeaux in reorganizing its town school along the new
lines was typical of the work of other southern cities. Good teachers,
liberal instruction, and a broad-minded attitude on the part of the
governing authorities [3] made this school, known as the _Collège de
Guyenne_, notable not only for humanistic instruction, but for intelligent
public education during the second half of the sixteenth century. The
picture of this college (school) left us by its greatest principal, Elie
Vinet (R. 136), gives an interesting description of its work.

[Illustration: FIG. 79. COLLÈGE DE FRANCE

HUMANISM IN GERMANY. The French language and life was closely related to
that of northern Italy, and French religious thought had always been so
closely in touch with that of Rome that something of the Italian feeling
for the old Roman culture and institutions was felt by the humanists of
France. In Germany and England no such feeling existed, and in these
countries any effort to discredit the rising native languages was much
more likely to be regarded as mere pedantry. In both these countries,
though, Latin was still the language of the Church, of the universities,
of all learned writing, and the means of international intercourse, and
after the new humanism had once obtained a foothold it was welcomed by
scholars as a great addition to existing knowledge. Erasmus, the foremost
scholar of his day, not only labored hard to introduce the new learning in
the schools, but welcomed the restored Roman tongue as an international
language for scholarship, as a potent weapon for destroying barriers of
language, religion, law, and possibly in time governments based on
nationality, and for the promise it gave of peace in international
relationships. In both Germany and England, in place of the patriotic
fervor of the Italians, religious zeal, as we shall see later on, was
kindled by the new humanistic studies.

[Illustration: FIG. 80. JOHANN REUCHLIN (1455-1522)
"Father of modern Hebrew Studies"]

Among the universities Vienna, Heidelberg, Erfurt, Tübingen, and Leipzig
(see Figure 61) were foremost in the introduction of the new learning.
Erfurt became the center of a group of humanistic scholars during the
closing years of the fifteenth century, and the first Greek book printed
in Germany appeared there, in 1501. At both Tübingen and Heidelberg
Reuchlin (p. 254) taught for a time, and both institutions early became
centers for the study of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. At Leipzig the reigning
duke brought various humanistic scholars to the university to lecture,
after 1507, and in 1519 entirely reformed the university by subordinating
the mediaeval disciplines to the new studies. Four new universities--
Wittenberg (1502), Marburg (1527), Königsberg (1544), and Jena (1558)--
were established on the new humanistic basis, and from their beginning
were centers for the new learning. At Wittenberg, Martin Luther had been
made Professor of Theology, in 1508, when but twenty-five years of age,
and to Wittenberg the Electoral Prince, in 1518, brought the young
Melanchthon, then but twenty-one, as Professor of Greek. The universities
of Germany were more profoundly affected by the introduction of the new
learning than were those of any other country. The monastic orders and the
Scholastics, who had for long controlled the German institutions, were
overthrown by the aid of the ruling princes, and by the close of the first
quarter of the sixteenth century the new humanism was everywhere
triumphant in German lands.

GERMAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. The enthusiasm of the humanists for the new
learning led them to urge the establishment of humanistic secondary
schools in the German cities. The schools of "The Brethren of the Common
Life" (Hieronymians), a teaching order founded by Gerhard Grote at
Deventer, Holland, in 1384, and which had established forty-five houses by
the time the new learning came into the Netherlands from Italy, at once
adopted the new studies, soon trebled the number of its houses, and for
decades supplied teachers of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew to all the
surrounding countries. [4] Wessel, Agricola, Hegius, Reuchlin, and Sturm
were among their greatest teachers, and Erasmus their greatest pupil. Here
and there in German cities Latin schools, teaching the subjects of the
_Trivium_, but principally the elements of Latin and grammar, had been
established in the course of the later Middle Ages, and to these scholars
trained in the new learning gradually made their way, secured employment,
and thus quietly introduced a purified Latin and the intellectual part of
the new humanistic course of study. Up to 1520 this method was followed
entirely in German lands.

As in Italy, the commercial cities were among the first to provide schools
of the new type. In 1526 the commercial city of Nuremberg, in southern
Germany, opened one of the first of the new city humanistic secondary
schools, Melanchthon being present and giving the dedicatory address. A
number of similar schools were founded about this time in various German
cities--Ilfeld, Frankfort, Strassburg, Hamburg, Bremen, Dantzig--among the
number. Many of these failed, as did the one at Nuremberg, to meet the
needs of the people in essentially commercial cities. Whatever might have
been true in more cultured Italy, in German cities a rigidly classical
training for youth and early manhood was found but poorly suited to the
needs of the sons of wealthy burghers destined to a commercial career. The
rising commerce of the world apparently was to rest on native languages,
and not on elegant Latin verse and prose. The commercial classes soon fell
back on burgher schools, elementary vernacular schools, writing and
reckoning schools, business experience, and travel for the education of
their sons, leaving the Latin schools of the humanists to those destined
for the service of the Church, the law, teaching, or the higher state
service.

[Illustration: FIG. 81. JOHANN STURM (1507-89)
(After a contemporary engraving by Stofflin)]

THE WORK OF JOHANN STURM. The most successful classical school in all
Germany, and the one which formed the pattern for future classical
creations, was the _gymnasium_ [5] at Strassburg, under the direction
(1536-82) of the famous Johann Sturm, or Sturmius, as he came to call
himself. This was one of the early classical schools founded by the
commercial cities, but it had not been successful. In 1536 the authorities
invited Sturm, a graduate of the University of Louvain, and at that time a
teacher of classics and dialectic at Paris, where he had come in contact
with the humanism brought from Italy, to become head of the school and
reorganize it. This he did, and during the forty-five years he was head of
the school it became the most famous classical school in continental
Europe. His _Plan of Organization_, published in 1538; his _Letters to the
Masters_ on the course of study, in 1565; and the record of an examination
of each class in the school, conducted in 1578, all of which have been
preserved, give us a good idea as to the nature of the organization and
instruction (R. 137).

Sturm was a strong and masterful man, with a genius for organization.
Probably adopting the plan of the French colleges (R. 136), he organized
his school into ten classes, [6] one for each year the pupil was to spend
in the school, and placed a teacher in charge of each. The aim and end of
education, as he stated it, was "piety, knowledge, and the art of
speaking," and "every effort of teachers and pupils" should bend toward
acquiring "knowledge, and purity and elegance of diction." Of the ten
years the pupil was to spend in the _gymnasium_, seven were to be spent in
acquiring a thorough mastery of pure idiomatic Latin, and the three
remaining years to the acquisition of an elegant style. Cicero was the
great model, but Vergil, Plautus, Terence, Martial, Sallust, Horace, and
other authors were read and studied. Except that the Catechism was first
studied in the native German, Latin was made the language of the
classroom. Great emphasis was placed on letter-writing, declamation, and
the acting of plays. Rhetoric, too, was made a very important subject of
study. Greek was begun in the fifth year of school and continued
throughout, all instruction in Greek being given through the medium of the
Latin. [7] The instruction in both Latin and Greek was much like that of
the court schools of Italy, except that in Greek the New Testament was
read in addition. The plays and games and physical training of the Italian
schools, however, were omitted; much less emphasis was placed on manners
and gentlemanly conduct; and in educational purpose a narrow drill was
substituted for the broad cultural spirit of the French and Italian
schools.

Sturm was the greatest and most successful schoolman of his day. In
clearly defined aim, thorough organization, carefully graded instruction,
good teaching, and sound scholarship, his school surpassed all others.
Sturm's aim was to train pious, learned, and eloquent men for service in
Church and State, using religion and the new learning as means, and in
this he was very successful. In a short time after taking charge his
_gymnasium_ had six hundred pupils, and in 1578 there were "thousands of
pupils, representing eight nations," in attendance. Sturm became widely
known throughout northern Europe, and scholars and princes passing through
Strassburg stopped to visit his school and secure his advice. He
corresponded with scholars in many lands, and the influence of his
institution was enormous. He was the author of many school textbooks, and
of half a dozen works on the theory and practice of education. He fixed
both the type and the name--_gymnasium_--of the German classical secondary
school, which to-day is not very materially changed from the form and
character which Sturm gave it. Sturm's work deeply influenced many later
foundations in Germany, and also helped to mould the educational system
devised later on by the Jesuits.

HUMANISM IN ENGLAND. Grocyn, Linacre, and Colet had introduced the new
learning at Oxford, as we have already seen (p. 253), in the closing years
of the fifteenth century (R. 133), but had made but little impression.
They were ably seconded by Erasmus, who taught Greek at Cambridge (1510-
14), and who labored hard to substitute true classical culture for the
poor Latin and the empty scholasticism of his time. He wrote textbooks [8]
to help introduce the new learning, urged the importance of history,
geography, and science as serving to elucidate the classics, edited
editions of the classical authors, wrote two treatises of importance on
education, [9] and in two other books [10] ridiculed those who mistook the
form for the spirit of the ancient learning. 'Unitarian Christianity sees
in Jesus Christ a supremely beautiful life and character, a marvellous
inspiration for us all, an ideal after which we may strive; and
it loves to think of him as our Elder Brother, of the same nature
as ourselves.In spite of the opposition of monks and scholastics in the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, and in the face of the coming religious turmoil in
the days of Henry VIII, the new learning made steady progress in the
universities, [11] with the court, and among the scholars and statesmen of
the time. With the coming of Elizabeth to the throne, [12] in 1558, the
court, from the Queen down, was imbued with the spirit of the new learning
(R. 139). Elizabeth appointed new chancellors for the two universities,
and these institutions were soon transformed from places for the training
of mediaeval scholars and theologians into places for the production of a
"due supply of fit persons to serve God in Church and State." As Sir
Thomas Elyot so well expressed it, in his _The Governour_ (1544)--a book
on the education of rulers for a State, and which was permeated by the new
spirit--"the new political order requires qualified instruments for its
administration, and a trained governing class must henceforth take the
place of the privileged caste and the clerk [cleric] education under the
mediaeval disciplines."

COLET AND SAINT PAUL'S SCHOOL. The first real establishment of the new
learning in England came through the secondary schools, and through the
refounding of the cathedral school of Saint Paul's, in London, by the
humanist John Colet, in 1510. Colet had become Dean of Saint Paul's
Church, and Erasmus urged him to embrace the opportunity to reconstruct
the school along humanistic lines. This he did, endowing it with all his
wealth, and in a series of carefully drawn-up Statutes (R. 138), which
were widely copied in subsequent foundations, Colet laid special emphasis
on the school giving training in the new learning and in Christian
discipline. Erasmus gave much of his time for years to finding teachers
and writing textbooks for the school. William Lily (1468-1522), another
early humanist recently returned from study in Italy, and the author of a
widely known and much used textbook [13]--_Lily's Latin Grammar_ (R. 140)
--was made headmaster of the school.

[Illustration: FIG. 83. SAINT PAUL'S SCHOOL, LONDON]

The course of study was of the humanistic type already described, coupled
with careful religious instruction. In place of the monkish Latin pure
Latin and Greek were to be taught, and the best classical authors took the
place of the old mediaeval disciplines. The school met with much
opposition, was denounced as a temple of idolatry and heathenism by the
men of the old schools, and even the Bishop of London tried twice to
convict Colet of heresy and suppress the instruction. Notwithstanding this
the school became famous for its work, not only in London but throughout
England. From its desks came a long line of capable statesmen, learned
clergy, brilliant scholars, and literary men.

us. Old men and children praise the name of the Lord."]

INFLUENCE ON OTHER ENGLISH GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. In a preceding chapter (p.
152) we mentioned the founding of many English grammar schools after 1200.
At the time Saint Paul's School was refounded there were something like
three hundred of these, of all classes, in England. They existed in
connection with the old monasteries, cathedrals, collegiate churches,
guilds, and charity foundations in connection with parish churches, while
a few were due to private benevolence and had been founded independently
of either Church or State. The Sevenoaks Grammar School, founded by the
will of William Sevenoaks, in 1432 (R. 141), and for which he stated in
his will that he desired as master "an honest man, sufficiently advanced
and expert in the science of Grammar, B.A., by no means in holy orders,"
and the chantry grammar school founded by John Percyvall, in 1503 (R.
142), are examples of the parish type. The famous Winchester Public
School, founded by Bishop William of Wykeham, in 1382, to emphasize
grammar, religion, and manners, and to prepare seventy scholars for New
College, at Oxford, [14] where they were to be trained as priests; and
Eton College, founded by Henry VI, in 1440, to prepare students for King's
College, at Cambridge, are examples of the larger private foundations. A
few, such as the grammar school at Sandwich (1579), owed their origin (R.
143) to the initiative of the city authorities. Most of these grammar
schools were small, but a few were large and wealthy establishments.

These old foundations, with their mediaeval curriculum, after a time began
to feel the influence of Colet's school. Within a century, due to one
influence or another, practically all had been remodeled after the new
classical type set up by Colet. In the course of study given for Eton (R.
144), for 1560, we see the new learning fully established, and in the
course of study for a small country grammar school, in 1635 (R. 145), we
see how fully the new learning, with its emphasis on Latin as a living
language, had by this time extended to even the smallest of the English
grammar schools. The new foundations, after 1510, were almost entirely
new-learning grammar schools, with large emphasis on grammar, good Latin
and Greek, games and sports, and the religious spirit. One of the most
conspicuous of these later foundations was Merchant Taylor's School, [15]
founded in London in 1561, and of which Richard Mulcaster (1531-1611), the
author of two important books on educational theory, [16] was for long the
headmaster. The first American Latin grammar school (Boston, 1635) was a
direct descendant of these English influences and traditions.

school, and saw companies of strolling players in the hall below. The
lower picture shows the grammar-school room after its "restoration," in

THE REACTION AGAINST MEDIAEVALISM. Having traced the introduction of the
new learning by countries, it still remains to point out certain
significant educational features of the movement which were common in all
lands, and which profoundly modified subsequent educational practice. Both
the purpose and the method of education were permanently changed.

Up to about the middle of the fourth Christian century the aim of both
Greek and Roman education had been to prepare men to become good and
useful citizens in the State. Then the Church gained control of education,
and for a thousand years the chief object was to prepare for the world to
come. Success and good citizenship in this world counted for little,
religious devotion took the place of the old state patriotism, the
salvation of souls took the place of the promotion of the social welfare,
and the aim and end of life here was to attain everlasting bliss in the
world to come. To be able to appease the dread Judge at the Day of
Judgment, prayer, penance, and holy contemplation were the important
things here below. It was preëminently the age of the self-abasing monk,
and this mental attitude dominated all thinking and learning.

The spirit behind the Revival of Learning was a protest against this
mediaeval attitude, and the protest was vigorous and successful. The
Revival of Learning was a clear break with mediaeval traditions and with
mediaeval authority. It restored to the world the ideals of earlier
education--self-culture, and preparation for usefulness and success in the
world here. In Italy, France, Germany, and England the movement, too, met
with the most thorough approval from modern men--merchants, court
officials, and scholars who were ready to break with the mediaeval type of
thinking. The court and other types of secondary schools now established
were popular with the higher classes in society, and this aristocratic
stamp the humanistic schools and courses have ever since retained. These
schools restored to the world the practical education of the days of
Cicero, and preparation for intelligent service in the Church, State, and
the larger business life became one of their important purposes. Supported
as they were by the ruling classes, the new schools were close to the most
progressive forces in the national life of the different countries. They
represented an unmistakable reaction against the world of the mediaeval
monk and the Scholastic, and their early success was in large part because
of this.

MODIFICATION OF THE MEDIAEVAL CURRICULUM. The mediaeval curriculum, as we
have seen (chap. VII), was based on instruction in the Seven Liberal Arts.
Grammar at first was the great subject, but later Dialectic became the
master science. Knowledge was regarded as an organic whole, capable of
being stated in a brief encyclopaedia, and each man could learn it all.
With the rise of university instruction some new knowledge was added,
chiefly from Moslem sources, and the old knowledge was minutely re-ground.
With the revival of the ancient learning there came, within a little more
than a century, an enormous increase in the world's sum of knowledge, and
the invention of printing came just in time to multiply and scatter this
new knowledge throughout western Europe. To all the old subjects a new
wealth of detail was added which made teaching encyclopaedias impossible.
New purposes in education now came to prevail, and the great mediaeval
teaching curriculum was changed in content and in relative importance.

Of the subjects in the old _Trivium_, Dialectic or Logic, which
Scholastics had raised to the place of first importance, was dethroned,
and relegated to a minor position in university instruction. In its place
Grammar, as Quintilian knew and used the term (R. 76) and as based on and
including Literature, was raised once more to the place of first
importance. Out of this, Literature--at first the classical and later the
modern--later came as a separate study, as did also the study of History
and Mythology. By the latter part of the sixteenth century technical
Grammar had been separated from Literature, and made a more elementary
subject, while Rhetoric had developed into a critical study of literary
art. Of the subjects of the _Quadrivium_, Arithmetic, Geometry, and
Astronomy were each greatly expanded, as a result of the introduction of
much new knowledge, and each was reduced to textbook form, while Algebra
and Trigonometry were now organized as teaching subjects. Due to their
newness and difficulty these subjects were taught chiefly in the
universities. There they remained for a long time before being passed down
to the secondary schools. Out of the very elemental instruction given in
Geography and Astronomy were in time evolved all the biological and
physical sciences, though this development belongs to a later chapter
(XVII), and these new subjects did not reach the secondary schools until
well into the nineteenth century. The last of the quadrivial subjects,
Music, experienced a different history in different countries. In the
Germanic countries it continued to receive its old emphasis, while in
England and France much less was made of it. After the setting-in of
Puritanism in England, when music was regarded with great disfavor, it in
large part passed out of the English curriculum. As a result the Germanic
and Scandinavian nations are to-day singing nations, while the English and
American are not. In early America, in particular, was the religious
reaction against music especially strong.

[Illustration: FIG. 85. THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN STUDIES
The great study of each period is in CAPITALS; subjects in _italics_
indicate that they also were quite important. Least important subjects in
ordinary type.]

NEW TEACHING METHODS. Such important changes naturally called for a
progressively evolving series of printed textbooks, and these now came
fast from the presses. The day of one textbook, which could dominate all
instruction for hundreds of years, was over forever. A few books, such as
Lily's or Melanchthon's Latin grammars and the textbooks of Erasmus, were
still used for a long time, but throughout the sixteenth century, before
the schools became formalized and lost their earlier purpose, each
textbook issued was soon superseded by a better one. The invention of
printing, too, changed teaching from a reading-by-the-professor to a
textbook method, and tremendously shortened the time necessary to give
instruction in any subject. With the manufacture of paper the written
theme, too, displaced the disputation, with great gains in accuracy of
thinking and refinement in the use of words. It was still the Latin theme
or verse or oration, to be sure, and the object of the new instruction was
to teach Latin as a living language, but before long the time was to come
when the same methods would be transferred to instruction in the native
tongues and for national ends.

To make the instruction as practical as possible, and thus prepare the
pupils for service as Latin scholars in public or scholarly pursuits, the
ancient literature was studied in part as a storehouse of adequate and
elegant expression, and numerous phrase books [17] were written for use in
the schools. When we remember that Latin was still the language of all
learned literature, of the university classroom, of most diplomatic and
legal documents, and a practical necessity for travel or communication
abroad, we can realize why so much emphasis was placed on the constant use
of Latin as the language of the school. [18] As Leach [19] so well puts
it:

    "The learned professions required a competent knowledge of Latin far
    more directly then than now. A need for Latin was not confined to the
    Church and the priest. The diplomatist, the lawyer, the civil servant,
    the physician, the naturalist, the philosopher, wrote, read, and to a
    large extent spoke and perhaps thought in Latin. Nor was Latin only
    the language of the higher professions. A merchant, or a bailiff of a
    manor, wanted it for his accounts; every town clerk or guild clerk
    wanted it for his minute book. Columbus had to study for his voyages
    in Latin; the general had to study tactics in it. The architect, the
    musician, every one who was neither a mere soldier nor a mere
    handicraftsman, wanted, not a smattering of grammar, but a living
    acquaintance with the tongue, as a spoken as well as a written
    language."

THE SCHOOLS BECOME FORMAL. After the new learning had obtained a firm
footing in the schools there happened what has often happened in the
history of new educational efforts--that is, the new learning became
narrow, formal, and fixed, and lost the liberal spirit which actuated its
earlier promoters. In the beginning the Italian humanists had aimed at
large personal self-culture and individual development, and the northern
humanists at moral and religious reform and preparation for useful
service, both using the classics as a means to these new ends. After about
1500 in Italy, and 1600 in the northern countries, when the new-learning
schools had become well established and thoroughly organized, the tendency
arose to make the means an end in itself. Instead of using the classical
literatures to impart a liberal education, give larger vision, and prepare
for useful public service, they came to be used largely for disciplinary
ends. The teaching of Campion at Prague (1574) well illustrates this
degeneracy (R. 146). This change alienated practical men from the schools.
French now in turn became the language of the court and of diplomacy, and
the work of the schools tended to be confined largely to preparing
students to enter the universities or the service of the Church. Men of
the world hence turned to a new type of schools which now arose (chapter
xvii), and which made preparation for social efficiency in a modern world
their aim.

In consequence the aim of the new humanistic education came in time to be
thought of in terms of languages and literatures, instead of in terms of
usefulness as a preparation for intelligent living, and educational effort
was transferred from the larger human point of view of the early
humanistic teachers to the narrower and much less important one of
mastering Greek and Latin, writing verses, and cultivating a good
(Ciceronian) Latin style. Sturm's school at Strassburg clearly shows the
beginnings of such a transformation (R. 137). As Latin came to be less and
less used by scholars in writing, passed out of use as the language of
government and of international communication, was replaced by French as
the language of polite society, and was gradually superseded in the
university lecture room by the vernaculars, the practical motive for
learning Latin died out, except for service in the Church, and the
disciplinary and cultural value of the study of the classics alone
remained. The disciplinary, being easier to give, and better within the
understanding of most teachers, gradually won over the cultural. As a
result, classical education gradually became narrow and formal, and drill
in composition and declamation and imitation of the style of ancient
authors--particularly Cicero, whence the term "Ciceronianism" which came
to be applied to it--grew to be the ruling motives in instruction. By the
end of the sixteenth century this change had taken place in both the
secondary schools and the universities, and this narrow linguistic
attitude continued to dominate classical education, in German lands until
the mid-eighteenth, and in all other western European countries and in
America until near the middle of the nineteenth century. It was not until
vigorously challenged by the enthusiasts for modern scientific studies
that the teachers of the classics awoke to the need of improving their
instruction and restoring something of the old cultural value to what they
were teaching.

The new learning in northern and western Europe was also much changed in
character by the violent religious dissensions, following the Protestant
Revolt, to a consideration of which we next turn.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Explain just what is meant by the statement that mediaeval education
was narrowly technical.

2. State the educational ideals of the new secondary schools evolved by
the Italian humanistic scholars, and show whether these ideals have been
best embodied in the German _gymnasium_ or the English grammar school.

3. How do you explain the merchants and bankers and princes of Italy being
more interested in the revival-of-learning movement than the Church and
university scholars? Do such classes to-day show the same type of interest
in aiding learning?

4. What was the particular importance of the recovery of Quintilian's
_Institutes_? Of Cicero's _Orations_ and _Letters_?

5. What better methods could the Italian court schools have used to enable
them to cover the university Arts course in shorter time? How would this
have advanced the character of the instruction in Arts in the university?

6. Show how the type of education developed in the Italian court schools
was superior to that of the best of the cathedral schools. To that
developed by Sturm.

7. Show how the new type of secondary schools was naturally associated
with court and nobility and men of large worldly affairs, and how in
consequence the new secondary education became and for long continued to
be considered as aristocratic education.

8. Explain how the terms _college_, _lycée_, _gymnasium_, _academy_, and
_grammar school_ all came to be employed, in different countries, to
designate about the same type of secondary school.

9. Had the purified Latin been restored, as the general international
language of learning and government, would it have helped materially in
bringing about the civilizing influences Erasmus saw in it?

10. Has the development of separate nationalities and different national
languages aided in advancing international peace and civilization? Why?

11. Why should the new humanistic studies have developed religious fervor
in Germany and England, in place of the patriotic fervor of the Italian
scholars?

12. Was the struggle against the introduction of the new learning into the
German universities parallel to the late struggle against the introduction
of science into American universities?

13. Contrast the aim of Sturm's school with that of the Italian court
schools, and the English grammar schools. Point out the new tendencies in
his work.

14. Does the sentence quoted from Elyot's _Governour_ express well the
changed conditions in England at the middle of the sixteenth century? Do
such changed conditions always demand educational reorganizations?

15. What basis, if any, did the opponents of Colet's school have for
denouncing it as a temple of idolatry and heathenism?

16. Show how it was natural that the first American school should have
been a Latin grammar school in type.

17. Show that the new conception as to education, as expressed by the new
humanism, found a public ready to support it. What was the nature of this
public?

18. Show how the new schools were "close to the most progressive forces in
the national life," and the influence of this, particularly in England and
America, in fixing classical training as the approved type of secondary
education.

19. Explain how the written theme of to-day is the successor of the
mediaeval disputation.

20. Show how the methods of instruction employed in the new Latin grammar
schools have been passed over to the native-language schools.

21. From the paragraph quoted from Leach (p. 282), explain why a knowledge
of Latin was for so long regarded as synonymous with being educated.

22. Show how instruction in Latin, by being changed from cultural to
disciplinary ends, made French the language of diplomacy and society,
tended to elevate all the vernacular tongues, and marked the beginnings of
the end of the importance of Latin as a school study except for the
purposes of the Roman Catholic Church.

23. What was the purpose of the Latin instruction, as you received it?

24. Does it require a higher quality of teaching to impart the cultural
aspect of a study than is required for the disciplinary?

CHAPTER XII

THE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY


THE NEW QUESTIONING ATTITUDE. The student can hardly have followed the
history of educational development thus far without realizing that a
serious questioning of the practices and of the dogmatic and repressive
attitude of the omnipresent mediaeval Church was certain to come, sooner
or later, unless the Church itself realized that the mediaeval conditions
which once demanded such an attitude were rapidly passing away, and that
the new life in Christendom now called for a progressive stand in
religious matters as in other affairs. The new life resulting from the
Crusades, the rise of commerce and industry, the organization of city
governments, the rise of lawyer and merchant classes, the formation of new
national States, the rise of a new "Estate" of tradesmen and workers, the
new knowledge, the evolution of the university organizations, and the
discovery of the art of printing--all these forces had united to develop a
new attitude toward the old problems and to prepare western Europe for a
rapid evolution out of the mediaeval conditions which had for so long
dominated all action and thinking. This the Church should have realized,
and it should have assumed toward the progressive tendencies of the time
the same intelligent attitude assumed earlier toward the rise of
scholastic inquiry. But it did not, and by the fifteenth century the
situation had been further aggravated by a marked decline in morality on
the part of both monks and clergy, which awakened deep and general
criticism in all lands, but particularly among the northern peoples.

The Revival of Learning was the first clear break with mediaevalism. In
the critical and constructive attitude developed by the scholars of the
movement, their renunciation of the old forms of thinking, the new craving
for truth for its own sake which they everywhere awakened, and their
continual appeal to the original sources of knowledge for guidance, we
have the definite beginnings of a modern scientific spirit which was
destined ultimately to question all things, and in time to usher in modern
conceptions and modern ways of thinking. The authority of the mediaeval
Church would be questioned, and out of this questioning would come in time
a religious freedom and a religious tolerance unknown in the mediaeval
world. The great world of scientific truth would be inquired into and the
facts of modern science established, regardless of what preconceived
ideas, popular or religious, might be upset thereby. The divine right of
kings to rule, and to dispose of the fortunes and happiness of their
peoples as they saw fit, was also destined to be questioned, and another
new "Estate" would in time arise and substitute, instead, in all
progressive lands, the divine right of the common people. Religious
freedom and toleration, scientific inquiry and scholarship, and the
ultimate rise of democracy were all involved in the critical, questioning,
and constructive attitude of the humanistic scholars of the Renaissance.
These came historically in the order just stated, and in this order we
shall consider them.

HUMANISM BECAME A RELIGIOUS REFORM MOVEMENT IN THE NORTH. In Italy the
Revival of Learning was classical and scientific in its methods and
results, and awakened little or no tendency toward religious and moral
reform. Instead it resulted in something of a paganization of religion,
with the result that the Papacy and the Italian Church probably reached
their lowest religious levels at about the time the great religious
agitation took place in northern lands. In the latter, on the contrary,
the introduction of humanism awakened a new religious zeal, and religious
reform and classical learning there came to be associated almost as one
movement. In England, Germany, the Low Countries, and in large parts of
northern France, the new learning was at once directed to religious and
moral ends. The patriotic emotions roused in the Italians by the
humanistic movement were in the northern countries superseded by religious
and moral emotions, and the constant appeal to sources turned the northern
leaders almost at once back to the Church Fathers and the original Greek
and Hebrew Testaments for authority in religious matters.

Colet, from England, who had spent the years 1493-96 in Florence (p. 254),
during the period when Savonarola (1452-98) was preaching moral reform
there, returned home, not only a humanist, but a religious reformer as
well, and began to lecture at Oxford on the Epistles of Saint Paul in the
Greek. Linacre, Grocyn, Colet, Erasmus, and Sir Thomas More (author of
_Utopia_), among others, formed a little group of humanists all of whom
were also deeply interested in a reform of the practices of the Church.
Erasmus, in particular, labored hard by his writings to remove religious
abuses. His _Colloquies_ (1519), a widely used Latin reading book, was
banned from the classrooms of the University of Paris (1528), and
forbidden to be used in Catholic lands by the Church Council of Trent
(1564), because of the way in which it held up to ridicule the abuses in
the Church, the superstitions of the age, and the immoralities in the
lives of the monks and clergy. His work as Professor of Divinity at
Cambridge, his numerous editions of the writings of the Church Fathers,
and his Latin-Greek edition (1516), of the New Testament [1] all alike
tended to turn theological scholars back to the original sources instead
of to the scholastics for the foundations of their religious faith. In
Germany such men as Hegius (p, 271), Reuchlin (p. 254), and Melanchthon
(p. 270) began, by similar methods, to go back to Greek and Hebrew sources
and to the Church Fathers for new interpretations as to religious
doctrines. In so doing they discovered that many practices and demands of
the Church, all of which had grown up during the long mediaeval period,
were not in harmony with the earlier teachings of Christ, the Apostles, or
the early Fathers. In France, Jacques Lefèvre (c. 1455-1536), a humanist
and a pioneer Protestant, contended for the rule of the Scriptures and for
justification by faith, and translated the Bible into the French (New
Testament, 1523; complete, 1530) that the people might read it.

EVOLUTION OR REVOLUTION. "It takes a fellow's breath away," he confessed.
"Such a heap of them! But then I've never been to the British Museum."

"Then," said I, "you must be employing researchers for the book you are
writing."
"What?" he protested. "_Me_ writing a book? Not likely!"
"An article for some magazine, then?"
"Not a line."
"Well, at least you have been standing for your photograph, to illustrate
some book on Cricket that another fellow is writing."
He laughed.

"You have me there.

Yes, I've been photographed in the act of bowling-- 'Before' and 'After':
quite like Somebody's Hair Restorer."
"Well," said I, "and I wish you had contributed to the letterpress,
too.

For the wonder to me is, not that you cricketers
write books (for all the world wants to read them), but that you
do it so prodigiously well."

"Oh," said he, "you mean Ranji! But he's a terror."
"I was thinking of him, of course; but of others as well. Here, for instance,
is a book I have just bought, or rather an instalment of one:
_The Encyclopaedia of Sport_, edited by the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire,
Mr. Hedley Peek, and Mr. Aflalo, published by Messrs. Lawrence and Bullen:

Part IV., CHA to CRO. I turn to the article on Cricket, and am referred
'for all questions connected with fast bowling, and for many questions
associated with medium and slow' to 'the following paper by Tom
Richardson.'"
"Tom Richardson ought to know," put in Grayson.

"Good Heavens!" said I, "I am not disputing that! But I remember Ruskin's
insisting--I think in _Sesame and Lilies_--that no true artist ever talks
much of his art. The greatest are silent. 'The moment,' says Ruskin,
'a man can really do his work he becomes speechless about it. All words
become idle to him--all theories.' And he goes on to ask, in his
vivacious way, 'Does a bird theorise about building its nest?' Well, as to
that one cannot be sure.

But I take it we may call Richardson a true artist?"
"Certainly we may."
"And allow that he can really do his work?"
"Rather!"
"Then it seems to me that Ruskin's rule may apply to other arts, but not
to Cricket. For here is Richardson not only talking about fast bowling,
but expressing himself with signal ease and precision. Listen to
this, for instance:--
"'A ball is said to _break_ when, on touching the ground, it deviates
sharply from its original line of flight.'

"And again:--"
"'A ball is said to have 'spin' on it when it gains an acceleration of
pace, not necessarily a variation of direction, on touching the
ground.'

"It would be hard, I think, to improve upon these definitions. But let me
satisfy you that I was not exaggerating when I spoke of the dignity
of Mr. Richardson's English style:--
"'The bowler, whether born or made, should cultivate and acquire a high
action and a good swing of arm and body, as such a delivery will make
the ball rise quickly and perpendicularly from the pitch; but the action
must at all costs be easy and free, qualities which neither imitation
nor education must allow to disappear.'
"We often hear complaints--and reasonable ones for the most part--that the
wage given to first-class professional cricketers is no longer adequate.

But one of the pet arguments for increasing it is that their employment
begins and ends with the summer. Now, I certainly think that, while
bowlers write in this fashion, they can have little or nothing to dread
from the winter months."

"I declare," said Grayson, "I believe you are jealous!"
"Well, and why not? For, mark you, Mr. Richardson's is no singular case,
of which we might say--to comfort ourselves--that the Goddess of Cricket,
whom he serves so mightily, has touched his lips and inspired him for
a moment. Turn over these pages. We poor novelists, critics, men of
letters, have no such paper, such type, as are lavished on the experts who
write here upon their various branches of sport. _Our_ efforts are not
illustrated by the Swan Engraving Company. And the rub for us is that
these gentlemen deserve it all! I am not going to admit--to you, at any
rate--that their subjects are of higher interest than ours, or of
more importance to the world. But I confess that, as a rule, they make
theirs more interesting. When Mr. C. B. Fry discourses about Long Jumping,
or Mr. W. Ellis about Coursing, or Mr. F. C. J. Ford upon Australian
Cricket, there are very few novelists to whom I had rather be listening.
It cannot be mere chance that makes them all so eloquent; nor is it that
they have all risen together to the height of a single great
occasion; for though each must have felt it a great occasion when
he was invited to assist in this sumptuous work, I remarked a similar
eloquence in those who contributed, the other day, to Messrs.

Longmans' 'Badminton Library.' When sportsmen take to writing admirable
English, and peers of the realm to editing it, I hardly see where we poor
men of letters can expect to come in."
"The only cure that I can see," said Verinder, "is for Her Majesty to turn
you into peers of the realm. Some of you suggest this from time to time,
and hitherto it has puzzled me to discover why. But if it would qualify you
to edit the writings of sportsmen--"
"And why not? These books sell: and if aristocracy have its roots in
Commerce, shall not the sale of books count as high as the sale of beer?
The principle has been granted. Already the purveyors of cheap and
wholesome literature are invited to kneel before the Queen, and receive
the _accolade_."
"She must want to cut Tit-bits out of them," put in the Boy.

"Of course we must look at the proportion of profit. Hitherto the profits
of beer and literature have not been comparable; but this wonderful boom
in books of sport may redress the balance. Every one buys them. When you
entered I was glancing through a volume of new verse, but without the
smallest intention of buying it.

My purchases, you see, are all sporting works, including, of course, Prince
Ranjitsinhji's _Jubilee Book of Cricket_."
"Just so," snapped Verinder. "You buy books about sport: we spend an
afternoon in looking on at sport. And so, in one way or another,
we assist at the damnation of the sporting spirit in England."
When Verinder begins in this style an oration is never far distant.
I walked back with the three to the Temple.

  On our way he hissed and sputtered
    like a kettle, and we had scarcely reached his
  chamber before he boiled over in real earnest.
    

"We ought never to have been there! It's well enough for the Boy: he
has been playing steadily all the summer, first for Cambridge and afterwards
for his county. Now he has three days off and is taking his holiday.
But Grayson and I--What the deuce have we to do in that galley?
Far better we joined a club down at Dulwich or Tooting and put
in a little honest play, of a week-end, on our own account. We should be
crocks, of course: our cricketing is done. But we should be honest crocks.

At least it is better to take a back row in the performance, and find
out our own weakness, than pay for a good seat at Lord's or the Oval,
and be Connoisseurs of what Abel and Hearne and Brockwell can and
cannot do.
If a man wants to sing the praises of cricket as a national game, let him
go down to one of the Public Schools and watch its close or
cricket-ground on a half-holiday: fifteen acres of turf, and a dozen
games going on together, from Big Side down to the lowest form
match: from three to four hundred boys in white flannels--all keen
as mustard, and each occupied with his own game, and playing it to
the best of his powers.

_Playing it_--mark you: not looking on. That's the point: and that's what
Wellington meant by saying--if he ever said it--that Waterloo was won upon
the playing-fields at Eton. In my old school if a boy shirked the game
he had a poor time. Say that he shirked it for an afternoon's
lawn-tennis:
it was lucky for him if he didn't find his racquet, next day, nailed up on
the pavilion door like a stoat on a gamekeeper's tree. That was the sporting
spirit, sir, if the sporting spirit means something that is to save
England: and we shall not win another Waterloo by enclosing twenty-two
gladiators in a ring of twenty-two thousand loafers, whose only exercise
is to cheer when somebody makes a stroke, howl when some other body drops
a catch, and argue that a batsman was not out when the umpire has given
him 'leg-before.' Even at football matches the crowd has _some_ chance
of taking physical exercise on its own account--by manhandling the referee
when the game is over. Sport? The average subscriber to Lord's is just
as much of a sportsman as the Spaniard who watches a bull-fight, and just
a trifle more of a sportsman than the bar-loafer who backs a horse he has
never clapped eyes on. You may call it Cricket if you like:
I call it assisting at a Gladiatorial Show. True cricket is left to the
village greens."
"Steady, old man!" protested the Boy.

"I repeat it. For the spirit of the game you might have gone, a few years
ago, to the Public Schools; but even they are infected now with the
gladiatorial ideal. As it is you must go to the village green; for the
spirit, you understand--not the letter--"
"I believe you!" chuckled young Dawkins. "Last season I put in an off
day with the villagers at home. We played the nearest market town, and I
put myself on to bowl slows. Second wicket down, in came the fattest
man I ever saw. He was a nurseryman and seedsman in private life, and he
fairly hid the wicket-keep. In the first over a ball of mine got
up a bit and took him in the ab-do-men. 'How's that?' I asked. 'Well,' said
the umpire, 'I wasn't azackly looking, so I leave it to you. If it hit en
in the paunch, it's 'not out' and the fella must have suffered. But
if it took en in the rear, I reckon it didn't hurt much, and it's
'leg-before.''

I suppose that is what you would call the 'spirit' of cricket.

But, I say, if you have such a down on Lord's and what you call the
gladiatorial business, why on earth do you go?"
"Isn't that the very question I've been asking myself?" replied Verinder
testily.

"Perhaps we have an explanation here," I suggested; for during Verinder's
harangue I had settled myself in the window-seat, and was turning over
the pages of Prince Ranjitsinhji's book.

"'It is a grand thing for people who have to work most of their
time to have an interest in something or other outside their
particular groove.

    Cricket is a first-rate interest. The game has developed to such a pitch
    that it is worth taking interest in. Go to Lord's and analyse the
    crowd. There are all sorts and conditions of men there round the
    ropes--bricklayers, bank-clerks, soldiers, postmen, and stockbrokers.
    And in the pavilion are Q.C.'s, artists, archdeacons, and leader-writers.
    . . .'"
    "Oh, come!" Grayson puts in. "Isn't that rather hard on the
    stockbroker?"
    "It is what the book says.
    
    "'Bad men, good men, workers and idlers, all are there, and all at
    one in their keenness over the game. . . . Anything that puts very
    many different kinds of people on a common ground must promote
    sympathy and kindly feelings. The workman does not come away from
    seeing Middlesex beating Lancashire, or vice versa, with evil
    in his heart against the upper ten; nor the Mayfair _homme de plaisir_
    with a feeling of contempt for the street-bred masses. Both
    alike are thinking how well Mold bowled, and how cleanly Stoddart
    despatched Briggs's high-tossed slow ball over the awning. Even
    that cynical _nil admirari_ lawyer--'"
    I pointed a finger at Verinder.
    
    "'Even that cynical _nil admirari_ lawyer caught himself cheering
    loudly when Sir Timothy planted Hallam's would-be yorker into the
    press-box. True, he caught himself being enthusiastic, and broke off
    at once--'"
    "When I found it hadn't killed a reporter," Verinder explained.

"But I hope Ranjitsinhji has some better arguments than these if he wants
to defend gladiatorial cricket. At least he allows that a change has
come over the game of late years, and that this change has to be defended?"

"Yes, he admits the change, and explains how it came about. In the beginning
we had local club cricket pure and simple--the game of your Village
Green, in fact.

Out of this grew representative local cricket-- that is, district
or county cricket which flourished along with local club cricket.

Out of county cricket, which in those days was only local cricket
glorified, sprang exhibition or spectacular or gladiatorial cricket,
which lived side by side with, but distinct from, the other.
Finally, exhibition and county cricket merged and became one. And that is
where we are now."
"Does he explain how exhibition and county cricket came, as he puts it,
to be merged into one?"
"Yes. The introduction of spectacular cricket (he says) changed the basis
of county cricket considerably. For many years the exhibition elevens and
the counties played side by side; but gradually the former
died out, and the new elements they had introduced into the game were
absorbed into county cricket. The process was gradual, but in the end
complete.
The old county clubs and the new ones that from time to time sprang up added
the exhibition side of cricket to the old local basis. The county
clubs were no longer merely glorified local clubs, but in addition
business concerns. They provided popular amusement and good cricket; in
fact, they became what they are now--local in name, and partly local
in reality, but also run upon exhibition or spectacular lines."
"A truly British compromise!

Good business at the bottom of it, and a touch of local sentiment by way
of varnish. For of course the final excuse for calling an eleven after
Loamshire (let us say), and for any pride a Loamshire man may take in its
doings, is that its members have been bred and trained in Loamshire. But,
because any such limitation would sorely affect the gate-money, we
import players from Australia or Timbuctoo, stick a Loamshire cap with
the county arms on the head of each, and confidently expect our public to
swallow the fiction and provide the local enthusiasm undismayed."
"My dear Verinder, if you propose to preach rank Chauvinism, I have
done.
But I don't believe you are in earnest."
"In a sense, I am not. My argument would exclude Ranjitsinhji himself
from all matches but a few unimportant ones.

I vote for Greater Britain, as you know: and in any case my best arguments
would go down before the sheer delight of watching him at the wicket. Let
the territorial fiction stand, by all means. Nay, let us value it as the
one relic of genuine county cricket. It is the other side of
the business that I quarrel with."
"Be good enough to define the quarrel."
"Why, then, I quarrel with the spectacular side of the New Cricket;
which, when you come to look into it, is the gate-money side. How does
Ranjitsinhji defend it?"
"Let me see. 'Its justification is the pleasure it provides for
large numbers of the public.'"
"Quite so: the bricklayer and the stockbroker by the ropes, and the
cynical lawyer in the pavilion! But I prefer to consider the interests
of the game."
"'From a purely cricket point of view,' he goes on, 'not much can
be said against it.'"
"Let us inquire into that. The New Cricket is a business concern:
it caters for the bricklayer, the stockbroker, and the whole crowd
of spectators. Its prosperity depends on the attraction it offers
them.
To attract them it must provide first-class players, and the county
that cannot breed first-class players is forced to hire them. This
is costly; but again the cash comes out of the spectators' pockets,
in subscriptions and gate-money. Now are you going to tell me that
those who pay the piper will refrain from calling the tune? Most
certainly they will not.
More and more frequently in newspaper reports of cricket-matches
you find discussions of what is 'due to the public.' If stumps, for
some reason or other, are drawn early, it is hinted that the
spectators have a grievance; a captain's orders are canvassed and
challenged, and so is the choice of his team; a dispute between a
club and its servants becomes an affair of the streets, and is taken
up by the press, with threats and counter-threats. In short, the
interest of the game and the interest of the crowd may not be
identical; and whereas a captain used to consider only the interest
of the game, he is now obliged to consider both.
Does Ranjitsinhji point this out?"
"He seems, at any rate, to admit it; for I find this on page 232,
in his chapter upon 'Captaincy':--
"'The duties of a captain vary somewhat according to the kind of
match in which his side is engaged, and to the kind of club which
has elected him. To begin with, first-class cricket, including
representative M.C.C., county and university matches, is quite
different from any other--partly because the results are universally
regarded as more important, partly _because certain obligations
towards the spectators have to be taken into consideration.Calvin's _The
Institutes of Christianity_, published in Latin in 1536, and in French in
1541, was the first orderly presentation of the principles of Christian
faith from the Protestant standpoint, [13] while his French _Catechism_
(1537) was extensively used [14] in Calvinistic lands as a basis for
elementary religious instruction.

[Illustration: FIG. 90. JOHN CALVIN (1509-1564)

From Geneva a reformed Calvinistic religion spread over northern France,
[15] where its followers became known as _Huguenots_; to Scotland (1560),
where they were known as _Scotch Presbyterians_; to the Netherlands
(1572), where originated the Dutch Reformed Church; and to portions of
central England, where those who embraced it became known as _Puritans_.
Through the Puritans who settled New England, and later through the
Huguenots in the Carolinas, the Scotch Presbyterians in the central
colonies, and the Dutch in New York, Calvinism was carried to America, was
for long the dominant religious belief, and profoundly colored all early
American education. Lutheranism also came in through the Swedes along the
Delaware and the Germans in Pennsylvania, while the Anglican Church, known
in America as the _Episcopalian_, came in through the landed aristocracy
in Virginia and the later settlers in New York. The early settlement of
America was thus a Protestant settlement, while the migration to America
of large numbers of peoples from Catholic lands is a relatively recent
movement.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND RELIGIOUS WARFARE. Of course the revolt against the
authority of the Church, once inaugurated, could not be stopped. The same
right to freedom in religious belief which Luther claimed for himself and
his followers had of course to be extended to others. This the Protestants
were not much more willing to grant than had been the Catholics before
them. The world was not as yet ready for such rapid advances, and
religious toleration, [16] though established in principle by the revolt,
was an idea to which the world has required a long time to become
accustomed. It took two centuries of intermittent religious warfare,
during which Catholic and Protestant waged war on one another, plundered
and pillaged lands, and murdered one another for the salvation of their
respective souls, before the people of western Europe were willing to stop
fighting and begin to recognize for others that which they were fighting
for for themselves. When religious tolerance finally became established by
law, civilization had made a tremendous advance.

The religious wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were waged
with greatest intensity in Spain, France, and the German States, though no
land wholly escaped. The result of this religious strife was to check the
progress of the higher civilization of the people for nearly three
centuries, and to delay greatly the coming of the great blessing of
freedom in matters of religious belief, while the poverty and misery
resulting from the devastation of these religious wars left neither the
energy for nor the interest in educational or political progress.

The struggle to suppress Lutheranism in Germany was postponed for twenty-
five years--due to outside pressure, chiefly that of the Turks in
southeastern Europe--from the time that the Diet of Worms decided against
Luther (1521). Finally, in 1546, the German-Spanish Emperor Charles V felt
at last free to proceed against the Lutheran heresy, and from the
breaking-out in that year of the struggle between Charles and the German
princes who sided with Luther, to the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648,
represents a century of almost continual religious warfare in the German
States. The worst of the period was the last thirty years, when religious
ferocity and hatred reached its climax in the period known as the _Thirty
Years' War_ (1618-48). Though fought on German soil, France, Spain, and
Sweden were deeply involved in the struggle. It left Germany a ruin. From
the most prosperous State in Europe, in 1550, Germany was so reduced that
it was not until the second third of the nineteenth century that central
and southern Germany had fully recovered. More than half the population
and two thirds of the movable property were swept away. The people were so
reduced by starvation that cannibalism was openly practiced. But one tenth
of the inhabitants of the Duchy of Würtemberg were left alive. Land tilled
for centuries became a wilderness, thousands of towns were destroyed,
whole trades were swept away, and the generation which survived the war
came to manhood without knowing education, religion, law and order, or
organized industry. Not until the end of the eighteenth century was
Germany again able to make any significant contribution to education or
civilization, and not until the middle of the nineteenth century did parts
of Germany come to have as many people or cattle as before this
devastating religious war broke out.

[Illustration: FIG. 91. A FRENCH PROTESTANT (c. 1600)
A restoration, Musée d'Artillerie, Paris]

From 1560 to 1629 in France, also, a period of carnage and devastation
prevailed, due to an attempt to exterminate the Calvinistic Huguenots. In
the massacre of Saint Bartholomew's eve, in 1572, ten thousand Protestants
are said to have perished in Paris alone, and forty-five thousand
additional outside the city. Though the Edict of Nantes (1598) had granted
religious toleration, this never was fully accomplished, and in 1685 the
Edict was revoked. The Huguenots were now given fifteen days to become
Catholics or leave France. The demands were enforced with great severity,
and the sect, which embraced one tenth of the population of France, was
stamped out and France became once more a Catholic country. In a short
time four hundred thousand thrifty and highly intelligent Huguenots had
left France for other lands. In Southern German lands, Holland, England,
and America many found a new home.

CHANGED ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OLD PROBLEMS. The Peace of Westphalia (1648),
which ended the bloody Thirty Years' War, itself the culmination of a
century of bitter and vindictive religious strife, has often been regarded
as both an end and a beginning. Though the persecution of minorities for a
time continued, especially in France, this treaty marked the end of the
attempt of the Church and the Catholic States to stamp out Protestantism
on the continent of Europe. The religious independence of the Protestant
States was now acknowledged, and the beginnings of religious freedom were
established by treaty. This new freedom of conscience, once definitely
begun for the ruling princes, was certain in time to be extended further.
Ultimately the day must come, though it might be centuries away, when
individual as well as national freedom in religious matters must be
granted as a right, and one of the greatest blessings of mankind finally
be firmly established by law. [17]

The end of the period of bitter religious warfare, too, was followed by a
reaction against religious intolerance which contained within itself the
germs of much future liberty and human progress. Paulsen has well
expressed the change, in the following words: [18]

    The long and terrible wars to which the ecclesiastical schism had
    everywhere given rise--the wars of the Huguenots in France, the Thirty
    Years War, and the Civil War in England--had, in the end, created a
    feeling of indifference toward religious and theological problems. Did
    it really pay, people asked themselves, to kill each other and
    devastate each other's countries for the sake of such questions? Could
    these problems ever be decided at all? If not, was it not much more
    reasonable to let everyone believe what he could, and, instead of
    wasting breath and arguments, convincing to nobody, on
    transubstantiation, predestination, and real presence, to cultivate
    sciences which really placed lasting and verifiable truths within the
    reach of the understanding, such as mathematics and natural
    philosophy, geography and astronomy? Here were sciences which offered
    knowledge to the mind that could be turned to account in this earthly
    life, whereas those transcendental speculations were of no use at
    all.... Toward the end of the seventeenth century this spirit of
    indifference and scepticism toward theology, and sometimes even toward
    religion in general and the future world, formed a most important
    factor in the changing intellectual attitude of the times. [19]

Physically exhausted, and recognizing at last the futility of fire and
sword as means for stamping out opposing religious convictions, but still
thoroughly convinced as to the correctness of their respective points of
view, both sides now settled down to another century and more of religious
hatred, suspicion, and intolerance, and to a close supervision of both
preaching and teaching as safeguards to orthodoxy. During the century
following the Peace of Westphalia greater reliance than ever before was
placed on the school as a means for protecting the faith, and the pulpit
and the school now took the place of the sword and the torch as converting
and holding agents.

RELIGIOUS REFORM. The effect of the Protestant Revolts on the Church was
good. For the first time in history Catholic churchmen learned that they
could not rely on the general acceptance of any teachings they
promulgated, or any practices they saw fit to approve. The spirit of
inquiry which had been aroused by the methods of the humanists would in
the future force them to explain and to defend. If they were to make
headway against this great rebellion they must reform abuses, purify
church practices, and see that monks and clergy led upright Christian
lives. Unless the mass of the people could be made loyal to the Church by
reverence for it, further revolts and the ultimate break-up of the
institution were in prospect. The Council of Trent (1545-63) at last
undertook the reform which should have come at least a century before.
Better men were selected for the church offices, and bishops and clergy
were ordered to reside in their proper places and to preach regularly. New
religious orders arose, whose purpose was to prepare priests better for
the service of the Church and for ministry to the needs of the people.
Irritating practices were abandoned. The laws and doctrines of the Church
were restated, in new and better form. Moral reforms were instituted. In
most particulars the reforms forced by the work of Luther were thorough
and complete, and since the middle of the sixteenth century the Catholic
Church, in morals and government, has been a reformed Church. Above all,
attention was turned to education rather than force as a means of winning
and holding territory. A rigid quarantine was, however, established in
Catholic lands against the further spread of heretical text books and
literature. Especially was the reading of the Bible, which had been the
cause of all the trouble, for a time rigidly prohibited. [20]

Such, in brief, are the historical facts connected with the various
revolts against authority which split the Roman Catholic Church in the
sixteenth century. These have been stated, as briefly and as impartially
as possible, because so much of future educational history arose out of
the conditions resulting from these revolts. The early educational history
of America is hardly understandable without some knowledge of the
religious forces awakened by the work of the Protestants. To the
educational significance and consequences of these revolts we next turn.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. How do you explain the difference in the effect, on the scholars of the
time, of the Revival of Learning in Italy and in northern lands?

2. How do you explain the serious church opposition to the different
attempts of northern scholars to try to turn the Church back to the
simpler religious ideals and practices of early Christianity?

3. Explain how opposition to the practices of the Church could be
organized into a political force.

4. Explain the analogy of a heretic in the fifteenth century and an
anarchist of to-day.

5. Assuming that the Church had encouraged progressive evolution as a
policy, and thus warded off revolution and disruption, in what ways might
history have been different?

6. How can the bitter opposition to the reading and study of the Bible be
explained?

7. Show the analogy between the freedom of thinking demanded by Luther,
and that obtained three centuries earlier by the scholars in the rising
universities. Why were the universities not opposed?

8. Enumerate the changes which had taken place in western Europe between
the days of Wycliffe and Huss and the time of Luther, which enabled him to
succeed where they had failed.

9. Explain in what ways the Protestant Revolt was essentially a revolution
in thinking, and that, once started, certain other consequences must
inevitably follow in time.

10. Was it perfectly natural that the reformers should refuse to their
followers the same right to revolt, and separate off into smaller and
still different sects, which they had contended for for themselves? Why?

11. On what basis could Catholic and Protestant wage war on one another to
try to enforce their own particular belief?

12. Compare the individualism of the Greek Sophists with that of the
Protestant reformers. Did Greece attempt to deal with them in the same
way?

CHAPTER XIII

EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE PROTESTANT REVOLTS


I. AMONG LUTHERANS AND ANGLICANS

ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BREAK WITH AUTHORITY. That the Protestant
Revolts in the different lands produced large immediate and permanent
changes in the character of the education provided in the revolting States
is no longer accepted as being the case. In every phase of educational
history growth has proceeded by evolution rather than by revolution, and
this applies to the Protestant Revolts as well as to other revolutions.
Many changes naturally resulted at once, some of which were good and some
of which were not, while others which were enthusiastically attempted
failed of results because they involved too great advances for the time.
Much, too, of the progress that was inaugurated was lost in the more than
a century of religious strife which followed, and the additional century
and more of suspicion, hatred, religious formalism, and strict religious
conformity which followed the period of religious strife. The educational
significance of the reformation movement, though, lies in the far-reaching
nature of its larger results and ultimate consequences rather than in its
immediate accomplishments, and because of this the importance of the
immediate changes effected have been overestimated by Protestants and
underestimated by Catholics.

The dominant idea underlying Luther's break with authority, and for that
matter the revolts of Wycliffe, Huss, Zwingli, and Calvin as well, was
that of substituting the authority of the Bible in religious matters for
the authority of the Church; of substituting individual judgment in the
interpretation of the Scriptures and in formulating decisions as to
Christian duty for the collective judgment of the Church; and of
substituting individual responsibility for salvation, in Luther's
conception of justification through personal faith and prayer, for the
collective responsibility for salvation of the Church. [1] Whether one
believes that the Protestant position was sound or not depends almost
entirely upon one's religious training and beliefs, and need not concern
us here, as it makes no difference with the course of history. We can
believe either way, and the course that history took remains the same. The
educational consequences of the position taken by the Protestants, though,
are important.

Under the older theory of collective judgment and collective
responsibility for salvation--that is, the judgment of the Church rather
than that of individuals--it was not important that more than a few be
educated. Under the new theory of individual judgment and individual
responsibility promulgated by the Protestants it became very important, in
theory at least, that every one should be able to read the word of God,
participate intelligently in the church services, and shape his life as he
understood was in accordance with the commandments of the Heavenly Father.
This undoubtedly called for the education of all. Still more, from
individual participation in the services of the Church, with freedom of
judgment and personal responsibility in religious matters, to individual
participation in and responsibility for the conduct of government was not
a long step, and the rise of democratic governments and the provision of
universal education were the natural and ultimate corollaries, though not
immediately attained of the Protestant position regarding the
interpretation of the Scriptures and the place and authority of the
Church. This was soon seen and acted upon. The great struggle of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in consequence, became one for
religious freedom and toleration; the great struggle of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries has been for political freedom and political rights;
to supply universal education has been left to the nineteenth and the
twentieth centuries.

SCHOOLS AND LEARNING BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. After the rise of the
universities, as we have seen, many Latin secondary schools were founded
in western Europe, and a more extensive development of the cathedral and
other larger church schools took place. Rashdall (R. 154) thinks that by
1400 the opportunity to attend a Latin grammar school was rather common,
an opinion in which Leach and Nohle concur. After the humanistic learning
had spread to northern lands these opportunities were increased and
improved. In England, for example, some two hundred and fifty Latin
grammar schools are known to have been in existence by 1500. In Germany,
as we have seen (chapter xi), many such schools were founded before the
time of Luther. These offered a form of advanced education, in the
language of the educated classes of the time, for those intending to go to
the universities to prepare for service in either Church or State, and for
teaching. The Church had also for long maintained or exercised control
over a number of types of more elementary schools--parish, song, chantry,
hospital (chapter VII)--the chief purpose of which was to prepare for
certain phases of the church service, or to enter the secondary schools.
These schools, too, were taught partly or wholly in Latin. In consequence,
while Latin schools came to be rather widely diffused, schools in the
vernacular hardly existed outside of a few of the larger commercial cities
of the north. Even the burgh and guild schools (p. 205), established in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, were essentially Latin schools.

In the commercial cities of the North, however, though often only after
quite a struggle with the local church authorities, which throughout the
Middle Ages had maintained a monopoly of all instruction as a protection
to orthodoxy, different types of elementary vernacular schools had been
developed to meet local commercial needs, such as writing-schools to train
writers, [2] and reckoning-schools to train young men to handle accounts.
[3] Reading, manners, and religion were also taught in these schools.
Other city schools, largely Latin in type, but containing some vernacular
instruction to meet local business needs not met by the cathedral or
parish schools of the city, were also developed. Up to the time of the
Protestant Revolts, however, there was almost no instruction in the
vernacular outside of the commercial cities, nor was there any particular
demand for such instruction elsewhere. If one wished to be a scholar, a
statesman, a diplomat, a teacher, a churchman, or to join a religious
brotherhood, he needed to study the learned language of the time,--Latin.
With this he could be at home with people of his kind anywhere in western
Europe. The vernacular he could leave to tradesmen, craftsmen, soldiers,
laborers, and the servant classes.

[Illustration: FIG. 92. TWO EARLY VERNACULAR SCHOOLS
GERMAN (From a woodcut, printed at Nuremberg, 1505)
FRENCH (After a drawing by Soquand, 1528)]

These people, on the other hand, had practically no need for a written
language, aside from a very small amount for business needs. Even here the
sign of the cross would do. There were but few books written in the
vernacular tongues, and these had to be copied by hand and, in
consequence, were scarce and expensive. There were no newspapers (first
newspaper, Venice, 1563) or magazines. Spectacles for reading were not
known until the end of the thirteenth century, and were not common for two
centuries after that. There was little knowledge that could not pass from
mouth to mouth. Such little vernacular literature as did exist was
transmitted orally, and no great issue which appealed to the imagination
of the masses had as yet come to the front to create any strong desire for
the ability to read. As a result, the education of the masses was in hand
labor, the trades, and religion, and not in books, and the need for book
education was scarcely felt.

A NEW DEMAND FOR VERNACULAR SCHOOLS. The invention of printing and the
Protestant Revolts were in a sense two revolutionary forces, which in
combination soon produced vast and far-reaching changes. The discovery of
the process of making paper and the invention of the printing press
changed the whole situation as to books. These could now be reproduced
rapidly and in large numbers, and could be sold at but a small fraction of
their former cost. The printing of the Bible in the common tongue did far
more to stimulate a desire to be able to read than did the Revival of
Learning (Rs. 155, 170). Then came the religious discussions of the
Reformation period, which stirred intellectually the masses of the people
in northern lands as nothing before in history had ever done. In an effort
to reach the people the reformers originated small and cheap pamphlets,
written in the vernacular, and these, sold for a penny or two, were
peddled in the market-places and from house to house. While there had been
imperfect translations of the Bible in German before Luther's, his
translation (New Testament, 1522) was direct from the original Greek and
so carefully done that it virtually fixed the character of the German
language. [4] Calvin's _Institutes of Christianity_ (French edition, 1541)
in a similar manner fixed the character of the French language, [5] and
Tyndale's translation of the New Testament (1526) was into such simple and
homely language [6] that it fixed the character of the English tongue, and
was made the basis for the later Authorized translation.

[Illustration: FIG. 93. THE FIRST PAGE OF WYCLIFFE'S BIBLE
Translated between 1382 and 1384. Facsimile of the first verses of
Genesis]

The leaders of the Protestant Revolts, too, in asserting that each person
should be able to read and study the Scriptures as a means to personal
salvation, created an entirely new demand, in Protestant lands, for
elementary schools in the vernacular. Heretofore the demand had been for
schools only for those who expected to become scholars or leaders in
Church or State, while the masses of the people had little or no interest
in learning. Now a new class became desirous of learning to read, not
Latin, but the language which they had already learned to speak. Wycliffe,
Huss, Zwingli, Luther, Calvin, and Knox alike insisted on the importance
of the study of the Bible as a primary necessity in the religious life. In
an effort to bring the Bible within reach of the people Wycliffe's
followers had attempted the laborious and impossible task of multiplying
by hand (p. 290) copies of his translation. Zwingli had written a pamphlet
on _The Manner of Instruction and Bringing up Boys in a Christian Way_
(1524), in which he urged the importance of religious education. Luther,
besides translating the Bible, had prepared two general Catechisms, one
for adults and one for children, had written hymns [7] and issued numerous
letters and sermons in behalf of religious education. All these were
printed in the vernacular and scattered broadcast. Luther thought that
"every human being, by the time he has reached his tenth year, should be
familiar with the Holy Gospels, in which the very core and marrow of his
life is bound." In his sermons and addresses he urged a study of the Bible
and the duty of sending children to school. Calvin's Catechism similarly
was extensively used in Protestant lands.


1. _Lutheran School Organization_

EDUCATIONAL IDEAS OF LUTHER. Luther enunciated the most progressive ideas
on education of all the German Protestant reformers. In his _Letter to the
Mayors and Aldermen of all the Cities of Germany in behalf of Christian
Schools_ (1524) (R. 156), and in his _Sermon on the Duty of Sending
Children to School_ (1530), we find these set forth. That his ideas could
be but partially carried out is not surprising. There were but few among
his followers who could understand such progressive proposals, they were
entirely too advanced for the time, there was no body of vernacular
teachers [8] or means to prepare them, the importance of such training was
not understood, and the religious wars which followed made such
educational advantages impossible, for a long time to come. The sad
condition of the schools, which he said were "deteriorating throughout
Germany," awakened his deep regret, and he begged of those in authority
"not to think of the subject lightly, for the instruction of youth is a
matter in which Christ and all the world are concerned." All towns had to
spend money for roads, defense, bridges, and the like, and why not some
for schools? This they now could easily afford, "since Divine Grace has
released them from the exaction and robbery of the Roman Church." Parents
continually neglected their educational duty, yet there must be civil
government. "Were there neither soul, heaven, nor hell," he declared, "it
would still be necessary to have schools for the sake of affairs here
below.... The world has need of educated men and women to the end that men
may govern the country properly and women may properly bring up their
children, care for their domestics, and direct the affairs of their
households." "The welfare of the State depends upon the intelligence and
virtue of its citizens," he said, "and it is therefore the duty of mayors
and aldermen in all cities to see that Christian schools are founded and
maintained" (R. 156).

[Illustration: FIG. 94. LUTHER GIVING INSTRUCTION
An ideal drawing, though representative of early Protestant popular
instruction]

The parents of children he held responsible for their Christian and civic
education. This must be free, and equally open to all--boys and girls,
high and low, rich and poor. It was the inherent right of each child to be
educated, and the State must not only see that the means are provided, but
also require attendance at the schools (R. 158). At the basis of all
education lay Christian education. The importance of the services of the
teacher was beyond ordinary comprehension (R. 157). Teachers should be
trained for their work, and clergymen should have had experience as
teachers. A school system for German people should be a state system,
divided into:

    1. _Vernacular Primary Schools._ Schools for the common people,
    to be taught in the vernacular, to be open to both sexes, to include
    reading, writing, physical training, singing, and religion, and to
    give practical instruction in a trade or in household duties. Upon
    this attendance should be compulsory. "It is my opinion," he said,
    "that we should send boys to school for one or two hours a day, and
    have them learn a trade at home the rest of the time. It is desirable
    that these two occupations march side by side."

    2. _Latin Secondary Schools._ Upon these he placed great emphasis
    (R. 156) as preparatory schools by means of which a learned clergy was
    to be perpetuated for the instruction of the people. In these he would
    teach Latin, Greek, Hebrew, rhetoric, dialectic, history, science,
    mathematics, music, and gymnastics.

    3. _The Universities._ For training for the higher service in
    Church and State.

[Illustration: FIG. 95. JOHANNES BUGENHAGEN (1485-1558)
Father of the Lutheran _Volksschule_ in northern Germany]

THE ORGANIZING WORK OF BUGENHAGEN. Luther assisted in reorganizing the
churches at Wittenberg (1523), Leipzig (1523), and Magdeburg (1524), in
connection with all of which he provided for Lutheran-type schools. [9]
Luther, though, was not essentially an organizer. The organizing genius of
the Reformation, in central and southern Germany, was Luther's colleague,
Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560), Professor of Greek at the University of
Wittenberg. In northern Germany it was Johannes Bugenhagen (1485-1558),
another of Luther's colleagues at Wittenberg. More than any other Germans
these two directed the necessary reorganization of religion and education
in those parts of Germany which changed from Roman Catholicism to German
Lutheranism. The churches, of course, had to be reorganized as Lutheran
churches, and the schools connected with them refounded as Lutheran
schools. For the reorganization of each of these a more or less detailed
_Ordnung_ had to be written out (Rs. 159, 160). In this change cathedral
and other large church schools became Latin secondary schools, while the
song, chantry, and other types of parish elementary schools were
transformed into Lutheran vernacular parish schools.

Bugenhagen was sent to reorganize the churches of northern Germany. Being
in close sympathy with Luther's ideas, he made good provision for Lutheran
parish schools in connection with each of the churches he reorganized. At
Brunswick (1528), Hamburg (1529) (R. 159), Lübeck (1530), for his native
State of Pomerania (1534), for Schleswig-Holstein (1537), and elsewhere in
northern Germany, he drew up church and school plans (_Kirchen und Schule-
Ordnungen_) which formed models (Rs. 159, 160) for many northern German
cities and towns. Besides providing for a Latin school for the city, he
organized elementary vernacular schools in each parish, for both boys and
girls, in which instruction in reading, writing, and religion was to be
given in the German tongue. He has been called the father of the German
_Volksschule_, though probably much of what he did was merely the
redirection of existing schools. In 1537 he was called to Denmark, by the
Danish King, to reorganize the University of Copenhagen and the Danish
Church and schools as Lutheran institutions.

Efforts were also made to create Protestant schools in the Scandinavian
countries. In Denmark writing-schools for both boys and girls were
organized, and the sexton of each parish was ordered to gather the
children together once a week for instruction in the Catechism. In Sweden
little was done before 1686, when Charles XI ordained that the sacristan
of each parish should instruct the children in reading, while the
religious instruction should be conducted by the clergy, and carried on by
means of sermons, the Catechism, and a yearly public examination. The
ability to read and a knowledge of the Catechism was made necessary for
communion. A Swedish law of this same time also ordered that, "No one
should enter the married state without knowing the lesser Catechism of
Luther by heart and having received the sacrament." This latter regulation
drove the peasants to request the erection of children's schools in the
parishes, to be supported by the State, though it was not for more than a
century that this was generally brought about. The general result of this
legislation was that the Scandinavian countries, then including Finland,
early became literate nations.

THE REORGANIZING WORK OF MELANCHTHON. Melanchthon, unlike Bugenhagen, was
essentially a humanistic scholar, and his interest lay chiefly In the
Latin secondary schools. He prepared plans for schools in many cities and
smaller States of central and southern Germany, among which were Luther's
native town, Eisleben (1525), and for Nuremberg (1526), Herzeberg (1538),
Cologne (1543), and Wittenberg (1545) among cities; and Saxony (1528),
Mecklenberg (1552), and the Palatinate (1556) among States. The schools he
provided for Saxony may be described as typical of his work.

In 1527 he was asked by the Elector of Saxony to head a commission of
three to travel over the kingdom and report on its needs as to schools. In
his _Report, or Book of Visitation_, which was probably the first school
survey report in history, he outlined in detail plans for school
organization for the State (R. 161), of which the following is an
abstract:

    Each school was to consist of three classes. In the first class there
    was to be taught the beginnings of reading and writing, in both the
    vernacular and in Latin, Latin grammar (Donatus), the Creed, the
    Lord's prayer, and the prayers and hymns of the church service. In the
    second class Latin became the language of instruction, and Latin
    grammar was thoroughly learned. Latin authors were read, and religious
    instruction was continued. In the third class more advanced work in
    reading Latin (Livy, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, and Cicero) was given,
    and rhetoric and dialectic were studied.

These were essentially humanistic schools with but a little preparatory
work in the vernacular, and their purpose was to prepare those likely to
become the future leaders of the State for entrance to the universities.
How different was Melanchthon's conception as to the needs for education
from the conceptions of Luther and Bugenhagen may easily be seen. Yet, so
great were his services in organizing and advising, and so well did such
schools meet the great demand of the time for educational leaders that he
has, very properly, been called "the Preceptor of Germany." His work was
copied by other leaders, and the result was the organization of a large
number of humanistic _gymnasia_ throughout northern Germany, in which the
new learning and the Protestant faith were combined. Sturm's school at
Strassburg (p. 272) was one of the more important and better organized of
this type, many of which have had a continuous existence up to the
present. By 1540 the process was begun of endowing such schools from the
proceeds of old monasteries, confiscated by the State, and many German
_gymnasia_ of to-day trace their origin back to some old monastic
foundation, altered by state authority to meet modern needs and purposes.

EARLY GERMAN STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. Melanchthon's Saxony plan was put into
partial operation as a Lutheran Church school system, but the first German
State to organize a complete system of schools was Würtemberg (R. 162), in
southwestern Germany, in 1559. This marks the real beginning of the German
state school systems. Three classes of schools were provided for:

    (1) Elementary schools, for both sexes, in which were to be taught
    reading, writing, reckoning, singing, and religion, all in the
    vernacular. These were to be provided in every village in the Duchy.

    (2) Latin schools (_Particularschulen_), with five or six
    classes, in which the ability to read, write, and speak Latin,
    together with the elements of mathematics and Greek in the last year,
    were to be taught.

    (3) The universities or colleges of the State, of which the University
    of Tübingen (f. 1476) and the higher school at Stuttgart were declared
    to be constituent parts.

Acting through the church authorities, these schools were to be under the
supervision of the State.

The example of Würtemberg was followed by a number of the smaller German
States. Ten years later Brunswick followed the same plan, and in 1580
Saxony revised its school organization after the state-system plan thus
established. In 1619 the Duchy of Weimar added compulsory education in the
vernacular for all children from six to twelve years of age. In 1642, the
same date as the first Massachusetts school law (chapter XV), Duke Ernest
the Pious of little Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg established the first school
system of a modern type in German lands. An intelligent and ardent
Protestant, he attempted to elevate his miserable peasants, after the
ravages of the Thirty Years' War, by a wise economic administration and
universal education. With the help of a disciple of the greatest
educational thinker of the period, John Amos Comenius (chapter XVII), he
worked out a School Code (_Schulmethode_, 1642) which was the pedagogic
masterpiece of the seventeenth century (R. 163). In it he provided for
compulsory school attendance, and regulated the details of method,
grading, and courses of study. Teachers were paid salaries which for the
time were large, pensions for their widows and children were provided, and
textbooks were prepared and supplied free. So successful were his efforts
that Gotha became one of the most prosperous little spots in Europe, and
it was said that "Duke Ernest's peasants were better educated than
noblemen anywhere else."

By the middle of the seventeenth century most of the German States had
followed the Würtemberg plan of organization. Even Duke Albrecht V of
Bavaria, which was a Catholic State, ordered the establishment of "German
schools" throughout his realm, with instruction in reading, writing, and
the Catholic creed, the schools to be responsible through the Church to
the State.

PROTESTANT STATE SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. We see here in German lands a new,
and, for the future, a very important tendency. Throughout all the long
Middle Ages the Church had absolutely controlled all education. From the
suppression of the pagan schools, in 529 A.D., to the time of the
Reformation there had been no one to dispute with the Church its complete
monopoly of education. Even Charlemagne's attempt at the stimulation of
educational activity had been clearly within the lines of church control.
Until the beginnings of the modern States, following the Crusades, the
Church had been the State as well, and for long humbled any ruler who
dared dispute its power. In the later Middle Ages nobles and rising
parliaments had at times sided with the king against the Church--warnings
of a changing Europe that the Church should have heeded--but there had
been no serious trouble with the rising nationalities before the sixteenth
century. Now, in Protestant lands, all was changed. The authority of the
Church was overthrown. By the Peace of Augsburg (1555) each German prince
and town and knight were to be permitted to make choice between the
Catholic and Lutheran faith, and all subjects were to accept the faith of
their ruler or emigrate.

This established freedom of conscience for the rulers, but for no one
else. It also gave them control of both religious and secular affairs,
thus uniting in the person of the ruler, large or small, control of both
Church and State. This was as much progress toward religious freedom as
the world was then ready for, as Church and State had been united for so
many centuries that a complete separation of the two was almost
inconceivable. It was left for the United States (1787) to completely
divorce Church and State, and to reduce the churches to the control of
purely spiritual affairs.

The German rulers, however, were now free to develop schools as they saw
fit, and, through their headship of the Church in their principality or
duchy or city, to control education therein. We have here the beginnings
of the transfer of educational control from the Church to the State,  the
ultimate fruition of which came first in German lands, and which was to be
the great work of the nineteenth century. It was through the kingly or
ducal headship of the Church, and through it of the educational system of
the kingdom or duchy, that the great educational development in
Würtemberg, Saxony, and Gotha was brought about by their rulers, and it
was through the ruling princes that the German Universities were reformed
[10] and the new Protestant universities established. [11] Even in
Catholic States, as Bavaria, the German state-control idea took root
early. Many of the important features of the modern German school systems
are to be seen in their beginnings in these Lutheran state-church schools.

2. _Anglican foundations_

THE REFORMATION AND EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. The Reformation in England took
a very different direction from what it did in Germany, and its
educational results in consequence were very different. In England the
reform movement was much more political in character than in German lands.
Henry VIII was no Protestant, in the sense that Luther or Calvin or
Zwingli or Knox was. He distrusted their teachings, and was always anxious
to explain objections to the old faith. The people of England as a body,
too, had been much less antagonized by the exactions of the Roman Church
and the immoral lives of the monks and Roman clergy; the new learning had
awakened there somewhat less of a spirit of moral and religious reform;
and the reformation movement of Luther, after a decade and a half, had
roused no general interest. The change from the Roman Catholic faith to an
independent English Church, when made, was in consequence much more
nominal than had been the case in German lands. As a result the severance
from Rome was largely carried out by the ruling classes, and the masses of
the people were in no way deeply interested in it. The English National
Church merely took over most of the functions formerly exercised by the
Roman Church, in general the same priests remained in charge of the parish
churches, and the church doctrines and church practices were not greatly
altered by the change in allegiance. The changing of the service from
Latin to English was perhaps the most important change. The English
Church, in spirit and service, has in consequence retained the greatest
resemblance to the Roman Catholic Church of any Protestant denomination.
In particular, the Lutheran idea of personal responsibility for salvation,
and hence the need of all being taught to read, made scarcely any
impression in England.

By the time of Elizabeth (1558-1603) it had become a settled conviction
with the English as a people that the provision of education was a matter
for the Church, and was no business of the State, and this attitude
continued until well into the nineteenth century. The English Church
merely succeeded the Roman Church in the control of education, and now
licensed the teachers (R. 168), took their oath of allegiance (R. 167),
supervised prayers (R. 169) and the instruction, and became very strict as
to conformity to the new faith (Rs. 164-166), while the schools, aside
from the private tuition and endowed schools, continued to be maintained
chiefly from religious sources, charitable funds, and tuition fees.
Private tuition schools in time flourished, and the tutor in the home
became the rule with families of means. The poorer people largely did
without schooling, as they had done for centuries before. As a
consequence, the educational results of the change in the headship of the
Church relate almost entirely to grammar schools and to the universities,
and not to elementary education. The development of anything approaching a
system of elementary schools for England was consequently left for the
educational awakening of the latter half of the nineteenth century. When
this finally came the development was due to political and economic, and
not to religious causes.

The English Act of Supremacy (R. 153), which severed England from Rome,
had been passed by parliament in 1534. In 1536 an English Bible was issued
to the churches, [12] the services were ordered conducted in English, and
in 1549 the English Prayer Book, Psalter, and Catechism were put into use.
In 1538 the English Bible was ordered chained in the churches, [13] that
the people might read it (R. 170), and the people were ordered instructed
in English in the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. Her
husband carried about a note-book and asked us questions about our private
concerns.
He brought no letters of introduction, and we do not know his
business.

The children behaved better."
(4) "Mr. Blank arrived here on a bicycle, and charmed us with the geniality
of his address.

We hope to see him again, as he left without discharging a number of
small debts."
It is, I take it, because the Briton has grown accustomed to invading
other people's countries, that he expects, when travelling, to find a
polite consideration which he does not import. But the tourist pushes
the expectation altogether too far. When he arrives at a town which
lays itself out to attract visitors for the sake of the custom
they bring, he has a right to criticise, _if he feel quite sure he is a
visitor of the sort which the town desires_. This is important: for a
town may seek to attract visitors, and yet be exceedingly unwilling to
attract some kinds of visitors. But should he choose to plant himself
upon a spot where the inhabitants ask only to go about the ordinary
occupations of life in quietness, it is the height of impertinence to
proclaim that the life of the place does not satisfy his needs. Most
intolerable of all is the conduct of the uninvited stranger who
settles for a year or two in some quiet town--we suffer a deal from such
persons along the south-western littoral--and starts with the intention
of "putting a little 'go' into it," or, in another of his favourite phrases,
of "putting the place to rights." Men of this mind are not to be reasoned
with; nor is it necessary that they should be reasoned with. Only, when
the inevitable reaction is felt, and they begin to lose their temper, I
would beg them not to assume too hastily that the 'natives' have no sense
of humour.
All localities have a sense of humour, but it works diversely with them.
A man may even go on for twenty years, despising his neighbours for the
lack of it. But when the discovery comes, he will be lucky if the
remembrance of it do not wake him up of nights, and keep him writhing in
his bed--that is, if we suppose _him_ to have a sense of humour
too.

An aeronaut who had lost his bearings, descending upon some farm
labourers in Suffolk, demanded anxiously where he was. "Why, don't you
know?
You be up in a balloon, bo." A pedestrian in Cornwall stopped a labourer
returning from work, and asked the way to St.--'. "And where might you come
from?" the labourer demanded. "I don't see what affair that is of yours.
I asked you the way to St. '--'." "Well then, if you don't tell us where
you be come from, we bain't goin' to tell you the way to St. '--'" It seems
to me that both of these replies contain humour, and the second a
deal of practical wisdom.

The foregoing remarks apply, with very little
modification, to those strangers who take up their residence in Cornwall
and, having sojourned among us for a while without ever penetrating to
the confidence of the people, pass judgment on matters of which, because
they were above learning, knowledge has been denied to them. A clergyman,
dwelling in a country parish where perhaps he finds himself the one
man of education (as he understands it), is prone enough to make
the mistake; yet not more fatally prone than your Gigadibs, the
literary man, who sees his unliterary (even illiterate) neighbours
not as they are, but as a clever novelist would present them to
amuse an upper or middle class reader.

Stevenson (a greater man than Gigadibs) frankly confessed that he
could make nothing of us:--
"There were no emigrants direct from Europe--save one German family
and a knot of Cornish miners who kept grimly by themselves, one reading
the New Testament all day long through steel spectacles, the rest
discussing privately the secrets of their old-world mysterious race. Lady
Hester Stanhope believed she could make something great of the Cornish:
for my part, I can make nothing of them at all.
A division of races, older and more original than that of Babel, keeps
this close esoteric family apart from neighbouring Englishmen.
Not even a Red Indian seems more foreign in my eyes. This is one of the
lessons of travel--that some of the strangest races dwell next door
to you at home."
This straightforward admission is worth (to my mind) any half-dozen of
novels written about us by 'foreigners' who, starting with the
Mudie-convention and a general sense that we are picturesque, write
commentaries upon what is a sealed book and deal out judgments which
are not only wrong, but wrong with a thoroughness only possible to
entire self-complacency.

And yet . . . It seems to a Cornishman so easy to get at Cornish
hearts-- so easy even for a stranger if he will approach them, as they
will at once respond, with that modesty which is the first secret of fine
manners.
Some years ago I was privileged to edit a periodical--though
short-lived not wholly unsuccessful--the _Cornish Magazine_.

At the end of each number we printed a page of 'Cornish Diamonds,' as we
called them--scraps of humour picked up here and there in the Duchy
by Cornish correspondents; and in almost all of them the Cornishman was
found gently laughing at himself; in not one of them (so far as I remember)
at the stranger.
Over and over again the jest depended on our small difficulties in making
our own distinctions of thought understood in English. Here are a few
examples:--
(1) "Please God," said Aunt Mary Bunny, "if I live till this evenin'
and all's well I'll send for the doctor

."
(2) "I don't name no names," said Uncle Billy "but Jack Tremenheere's
the man."
(3) "I shan't go there nor nowhere else," said old Jane Caddy, "I shall go
'long up Redruth."
(4) "I thought 'twere she, an' she thought 'twere I," said Gracey
Temby, "but when we come close 'twadn't narry wan o' us."
(5) A crowd stood on the cliff watching a stranded vessel and the
lifeboat going out to her.
"What vessel is it?" asked a late arrival.
"The _Dennis Lane_." "How many be they aboord?" "Aw, love and bless 'ee,
there's three poor dear sawls and wan old Irishman."
(6) Complainant (cross-examining defendant's witness): "What colour was
the horse?" "Black." "Well, I'm not allowed to contradict you, and I
wouldn' for worlds:
but I say he wasn't."
(7) A covey of partridges rose out of shot, flew over the hedge, and was
lost to view. "Where do you think they've gone?" said the sportsman to his
keeper. "There's a man digging potatoes in the next field.
Ask if he saw them." "Aw, that's old Sam Petherick: he hasna seed
'em, he's hard o' hearin'."
(8) _Schoolmaster_: "I'm sorry to tell you, Mr. Minards, that your son
Zebedee is little better than a fool." _Parent_: "Naw, naw, schoolmaster;
my Zebedee's no fule; only a bit easy to teach."
[I myself know a farmer who approached the head master of a Grammar
School and begged for a reduction in terms: "because," he pleaded, "I
know my son: he's that thick you can get very little into en, and I believe
in payment by results."]

    Here we pass from confusion of language into mere confusion of thought,
    the classical instance of which is the Mevagissey man who, having
    been asked the old question, "If a herring and a half cost three-halfpence,
    how many can you buy for a shilling?'" and having given it up
    and been told the answer, responded brightly, "Why, o' course!

Darn me, if I wasn' thinkin' of pilchards!" I met with a fair Devon
rival to this story the other day in the reported conversation of two
farmers discussing the electric light at Chagford (run by Chagford's
lavish water-power).
"It do seem out of reason," said the one, "to make vire out o'
watter." "No," agreed the other, "it don't seem possible: but there,"--after
a slow pause--"'tis butiful water to Chaggyford!"
It was pleasant, while the Magazine lasted, to record these and like
simplicities: and though the voyage was not long, one may recall
without regret its send-off, brave enough in its way:--
"'WISH 'EE WELL!'

"The ensign's dipped; the captain takes the wheel.
'So long!' the pilot waves, and 'Wish 'ee well!' Go little craft, and
with a home-made keel 'Mid loftier ships, but with a heart as leal,
Learn of blue waters and the long sea swell!

"Through the spring days we built and tackled thee, Tested thy timbers, saw
thy rigging sound, Bent sail, and now put forth unto the sea Where those
leviathans, the critics, be, And other monsters diversely profound.

"Some bronzed Phoenician with his pigmy freight Haply thy herald was,
who drave of yore Deep-laden from Bolerium by the Strait Of Gades, and
beside his city's gate Chaffered in ingots cast of Cornish ore.

"So be thou fortunate as thou art bold; Fare, little craft, and make the
world thy friend:
And, it may be--when all thy journey's told With anchor dropped and tattered
canvas rolled, And some good won for Cornwall in the end--
"Thou wilt recall, as best, a lonely beach, And a few exiles, to the barter
come, Who recognised the old West-country speech, And touched thee,
reverent, whispering each to each-- 'She comes from far--from very far--from
home.'"

I have a special reason for remembering _The Cornish Magazine_, because
it so happened that the first number (containing these hopeful
verses) was put into my hands with the morning's letters as I paced
the garden below this Cornish Window, careless of it or of anything
but a doctor's verdict of life or death in the house above.

The verdict was for life. . . .

Years ago as a child I used to devour in that wonderful book _Good Words
for the Young_, the _Lilliput Levee_ and _Lilliput Lyrics_ of the late
William Brighty Rands: and among Rands' lyrics was one upon "The Girl
that Garibaldi kissed." Of late years Rands has been coming to something
like his own. His verses have been republished, and that excellent artist
Mr.
Charles Robinson has illustrated them. But I must tell Mr. Robinson that
his portrait of the Girl that Garibaldi kissed does not in the least
resemble her. I speak with knowledge--I the child who have lived to
meet and know the child whom Garibaldi kissed and blessed as the
sailors were weighing anchor to carry him out of this harbour and away
from England.
Wild horses shall not drag from me the name of that young person;
because it happened--well, at an easily discoverable date--and she
may not care for me to proclaim her age (as certainly she does not
look it).

    "He bowed to my own daughter, And Polly is her name; She wore a
shirt of slaughter, Of Garibaldi flame--
"Of course I mean of scarlet; But the girl he kissed--who knows?

    -- May be named Selina Charlotte, And dressed in yellow clothes!"
       But she isn't; and she wasn't; for she wore a scarlet pelisse as
they handed her up the yacht's side, and the hero took her in his
arms.

    "It would be a happy plan For everything that's human, If the pet
of such a man Should grow to such a woman!

    "If she does as much in her way As he has done in his-- Turns bad
       things topsy-turvy, And sad things into bliss--
       "O we shall not need a survey To find that little miss, Grown to a
woman worthy Of Garibaldi's kiss!"

    Doggrel? Yes, doggrel no doubt! Let us pass on.
       
       

    In the early numbers of our _Cornish Magazine_ a host of contributors
       (some of them highly distinguished) discussed the question, 'How
to develop Cornwall as a holiday resort.'

'How to bedevil it' was, I fear, our name in the editorial office for
this correspondence. More and more as the debate went on I found myself
out of sympathy with it, and more and more in sympathy with a lady
who raised an indignant protest--
"Unless Cornishmen look to it, their country will be spoilt before
they know it. Already there are signs of it--pitiable signs; Not many months
ago I visited Tintagel, which is justly one of the prides of the Duchy. The
'swinging seas' are breaking against the great cliffs as they broke
there centuries ago when Arthur and Launcelot and the Knights of the Round
Table peopled the place.
The castle is mostly crumbled away now, but some fraction of its old strength
still stands to face the Atlantic gales, and to show us how walls were
built in the grand old days.

    In the valley the grass is green and the gorse is yellow, and overhead
       the skies are blue and delightful: but facing Arthur's Castle--grinning
       down, as it were, in derision--there is being erected a modern
       hotel--'built in imitation of Arthur's Castle,' as one is told! .
       . .

There is not yet a rubbish shoot over the edge of the cliff, but I
do not think I am wrong in stating that the drainage is brought
down into that cove where long ago (the story runs) the naked baby
Arthur came ashore on the great wave!"

In summing up the discussion I confess with shame that I temporised.
It was hard to see one's native country impoverished by the evil
days in which mining (and to a lesser degree, agriculture) had
fallen; to see her population diminishing and her able-bodied sons
emigrating by the thousand.

It is all very pretty for a visitor to tell us that the charm of
Cornwall is its primaeval calm, that it seems to sleep an enchanted
sleep, and so on; but we who inhabit her wish (and not altogether
from mercenary motives) to see her something better than a museum
of a dead past.

I temporised therefore with those who suggested that Cornwall might yet
enrich herself by turning her natural beauty to account: yet even
so I had the sense to add that--
"Jealous as I am for the beauty of our Duchy, and delighted when
strangers admire her, I am, if possible, more jealous for the
character of her sons, and more eager that strangers should respect
_them_.

And I do see (and hope to be forgiven for seeing it) that a people which
lays itself out to exploit the stranger and the tourist runs an
appreciable risk of deterioration in manliness and independence.

It may seem a brutal thing to say, but as I had rather be poor
myself than subservient, so would I liefer see my countrymen poor
than subservient.

It is not our own boast--we have it on the fairly unanimous evidence of all
who have visited us--that hitherto Cornishmen have been able to
combine independence with good manners.

For Heaven's sake, I say, let us keep that reputation, though at great cost!
But let us at the same time face the certainty that, when we begin
to take pay for entertaining strangers it will be a hard reputation
to keep.

Were it within human capacity to decide between a revival of our ancient
industries, fishing and mining, and the development of this new
business, our decision would be prompt enough.

But it is not."
I despaired too soon.

Our industries seem in a fair way to revive, and with that promise
I recognise that even in despair my willingness to temporise was
foolish.

For my punishment--though I helped not to erect them,--hideous hotels
thrust themselves insistently on my sight as I walk our magnificent
northern cliffs, and with the thought of that drain leading down
to Arthur's cove I am haunted by the vision of Merlin erect above
it, and by the memory of Hawker's canorous lines:--
"He ceased; and all around was dreamy night:
There stood Dundagel, throned; and the great sea Lay, like a strong
vassal at his master's gate, And, like a drunken giant, sobbed in
sleep!"

SEPTEMBER.

IN THE BAG, _August 30th_.

At the village shop you may procure milk, butter, eggs, peppermints,
trowsers, sun-bonnets, marbles, coloured handkerchiefs, and a number
of other necessaries, including the London papers.

But if you wish to pick and choose, you had better buy trowsers than the
London papers; for this is less likely to bring you into conflict
with the lady who owns the shop and asserts a prior claim on its
conveniences.

One of us (I will call him X) went ashore and asked for a London 'daily.'
"Here's _Lloyd's Weekly News_ for you," said the lady; "but you can't
have the daily, for I haven't finished reading it myself."

"Very well," said I, when this was reported; "if I cannot read the
news I want, I will turn to and write it." So I descended to the shop, and
asked for a bottle of ink; since, oddly enough, there was none to
be found on board. The lady produced a bottle and a pen.

"But I don't want the pen," I objected. "They go together," said she:
"Whatever use is a bottle of ink without a pen?"

For the life of me I could discover no answer to this. I paid my penny, and
on returning with my purchases to the boat, I propounded the following
questions:--
(1) _Quaere_.

If, as the lady argued, a bottle of ink be useless without a pen,
by what process of reasoning did she omit a sheet of paper from her
pennyworth?

(2) Suppose that I damage or wear out this pen before exhausting
the bottle of ink, can she reasonably insist on my taking a second
bottle as a condition of acquiring a second pen?

  (3) Suppose, on the other hand, that (as I compute) one pen
  will outlast two and a half bottles of ink; that one bottle will
  distil thirty thousand words; and that the late James
  Anthony Froude (who lived close by) drew his supply of
  writing materials from this shop: how many unused pens (at
  a guess) must that distinguished man have accumulated in
  the process of composing his _History of England?
  Show the close similarity of the Würtemberg plan of 1559-65 (162) and a
modern German state school system.

8. How advanced for the time was the work of Duke Ernest of Gotha (163)?

9. What kind of a school attitude is indicated by the close supervision of
English teachers, as described in 164 and 165?

10. What would be the natural effect on the teaching occupation of such
legislation as the Act of Uniformity (166)?

11. Compare the form of license of an elementary teacher (168) with a
modern form. What have we added and omitted?

12. What do the statutes regarding prayers (169) indicate as to the nature
of the grammar schools of the time?

13. Characterize the educational importance of the translations of the
Bible into the native tongues (170).

14. What are the marked features of the refounding act (172) for
Canterbury cathedral school? What improvements are indicated?

15. State the steps in the development (173) of the English Poor-Law of
1601, just what the law provided for (174), and just what elements
necessary to the creation of a state school system were incorporated into
it.

CHAPTER XIV

EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE PROTESTANT REVOLTS


II. AMONG CALVINISTS AND CATHOLICS


3. _Educational work of the Calvinisms_

THE ORGANIZING WORK OF CALVIN. From the point of view of American
educational history the most important developments in connection with the
Reformation were those arising from Calvinism. While the Calvinistic faith
was rather grim and forbidding, viewed from the modern standpoint, the
Calvinists everywhere had a program for political, economic, and social
progress which has left a deep impress on the history of mankind. This
program demanded the education of all, and in the countries where
Calvinism became dominant the leaders included general education in their
scheme of religious, political, and social reform. [1] In the governmental
program which Calvin drew up (1537) for the religious republic at Geneva
(p. 298), he held that learning was "a public necessity to secure good
political administration, sustain the Church unharmed, and maintain
humanity among men."

In his plan for the schools of Geneva, published in 1538, he outlined a
system of elementary education in the vernacular for all, which involved
instruction in reading, writing, arithmetic, religion, careful grammatical
drill, and training for civil as well as for ecclesiastical leadership. In
his plan of 1541 he upholds the principle, as had Luther, that "the
liberal arts and good training are aids to a full knowledge of the Word."
This involved the organization of secondary schools, or _colleges_ as he
called them, following the French nomenclature, to prepare leaders for the
ministry and the civil government through "instruction in the languages
and humane science." In the colleges (secondary schools) which he
organized at Geneva and in neighboring places to give such training, and
which became models of their kind which were widely copied, the usual
humanistic curriculum was combined with intensive religious instruction.
These colleges became famous as institutions from which learned men came
forth. The course of study in the seven classes of one of the Geneva
colleges, which has been preserved for us, reveals the nature of the
instruction (R. 175). The lowest class began with the letters, reading was
taught from a French-Latin Catechism, and the usual Latin authors were
read. Greek was begun in the fourth class, and, in addition to the usual
Greek authors, the New Testament was read in Greek. In the higher classes,
as was common also in German _gymnasia_, logic and rhetoric were taught to
prepare pupils to analyze, argue, and defend the faith. Elocution was also
given much importance in the upper classes as preparation for the
ministry, two original orations being required each month. Psalms were
sung, prayers offered, sermons preached and questioned on, and the Bible
carefully studied. The men who went forth from the colleges of Geneva to
teach and to preach the Calvinistic gospel were numbered by the hundreds.
[2]

Calvin's great educational work at Geneva has been well summarized by a
recent writer, [3] as follows:

    The strenuous moral training of the Genevese was an essential part of
    Calvin's work as an educator. All were trained to respect and obey
    laws, based upon Scripture, but enacted and enforced by
    representatives of the people, and without respect of persons. How
    fully the training of children, not merely in sound learning and
    doctrine, but also in manners, "good morals," and common sense was
    carried out is pictured in the delightful human _Colloquies_ of
    Calvin's old teacher, Corderius (once a teacher at the College of
    Guyenne, p. 269), whom he twice established at Geneva....

    Calvin's memorials to the Genevan magistrates, his drafts for civil
    law and municipal administration, his correspondence with reformers
    and statesmen, his epoch-making defense of interest taking, his
    growing tendency toward civil, religious, and economic liberty, his
    development of primary and university education, his intimate
    knowledge of the dialect and ways of thought of the common people of
    Geneva, and his broad understanding of European princes, diplomats,
    and politics mark him out as a great political, economic, and
    educational as well as a religious reformer, a constructive social
    genius capable of reorganizing and moulding the whole life of a
    people.

The world owes much to the constructive, statesman-like genius of Calvin
and those who followed him, and we in America probably most of all. Geneva
became a refuge for the persecuted Protestants from other lands, and
through such influences the ideas of Calvin spread to the Huguenots in
France, the Walloons of the Dutch and Belgian Netherlands, the Germans in
the Palatinate, the Presbyterians of Scotland, the Puritans in England,
and later to the American colonies.

[Illustration: FIG. 98. A FRENCH SCHOOL OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
(From an old woodcut by Abraham Bosse, 1611-78)]

CALVINISM IN THE OTHER LANDS. The great educational work done by the
Calvinists in France, in the face of heavy persecution, deserves to be
ranked with that of the Lutherans in Germany in its importance. Had the
Calvinists had the same opportunity for free development the Lutherans
had, and especially their state support, there can be little doubt that
their work would have greatly exceeded the Lutherans in importance and
influence on the future history of mankind. Beginning with one church in
1538, they had 2150 churches by 1561, when the severe persecutions and
religious wars began.

True to the Calvinistic teaching of putting principles into practice, they
organized an extensive system of schools, extending from elementary
education for all, through secondary schools or colleges, up to eight
Huguenot universities. As a people they were thrifty and capable of making
great sacrifices to carry out their educational ideals. The education they
provided was not only religious but civil; not only intellectual but
moral, social, and economic. Education was for all, rich and poor alike.
Their synods made liberal appropriations for the universities, while
municipalities provided for colleges and elementary education. They
emphasized, in the lower schools, the study of the vernacular and
arithmetic, and in the colleges Greek and the New Testament. The long list
of famous teachers found in their universities reveals the character of
their instruction. Foster has well summarized the distinguishing
characteristics of Huguenot education in France, before they were driven
from the land, as follows: [4]

    The significant characteristics of Huguenot education were: an
    emphasis on the education of the laity; training for "the republic"
    and "society" as well as for the Church; insistence upon virtue as
    well as knowledge; the wide-spread demand for education, and a view of
    it as essential to liberty of conscience; a comprehensive working
    system of elementary, collegiate, and university training for all,
    poor as well as rich; an astonishing familiarity with Scripture, even
    among the lowest classes; utilization of representative church
    organization for founding, supporting, and unifying education;
    readiness to sacrifice for education, a spirit of carrying a thing
    through at any cost; business-like supervision of money, and
    systematic supervision of both professors and students; a notable
    emphasis on vernacular, arithmetic, Greek, use of full texts, and
    libraries; and finally a progressive spirit of inquiry and
    investigation.

In the Palatinate (see map, Figure 88) some progress in founding churches
and schools was made, especially about Strassburg, and the universities of
Heidelberg and Marburg became the centers of Huguenot teaching. In the
Dutch Netherlands, and in that part of the Belgian Netherlands inhabited
by the Walloons, Calvinist ideas as to education dominated. The
universities of Leyden (f. 1575), Groningen (f. 1614), Amsterdam (f.
1630), and Utrecht (f. 1636) were Calvinistic, and closely in touch with
the Calvinists and Huguenots of German lands and France. Popular education
was looked after among these people as it was in Calvinistic France and
Geneva. The Church Synod of The Hague (1586) ordered the establishment of
schools in the cities, and in 1618 the Great Synod held at Dort (R. 176)
ordered that:

Schools in which the young shall be properly instructed in piety and
fundamentals of Christian doctrine shall be instituted not only in cities,
but also in towns and country places where heretofore none have existed.
The Christian magistracy shall be requested that honorable stipends be
provided for teachers, and that well-qualified persons may be employed and
enabled to devote themselves to that function; and especially that the
children of the poor may be gratuitously instructed by them and not be
excluded from the benefits of schools.

[Illustration: FIG. 99. A DUTCH VILLAGE SCHOOL
(After a painting by Adrian Ostade, dated 1662, now in the Louvre, at
Paris)]

Further provisions were made as to the certificating of schoolmasters, and
the pastors were made superintendents of the schools, to visit, examine,
encourage, advise, and report (R. 176). Provision for the free education
of the poor became common, and elementary education was made accessible to
all. The careful provision for education made by the province of Utrecht
(1590, 1612) (R. 178) was typical of Dutch activity. The province of
Drenthe ordered (1630) a school tax paid for all children over seven,
whether attending school or not. The province of Overyssel levied (1666) a
school tax for all children from eight to twelve years of age. The
province of Groningen constituted the pastors the attendance officers to
see that the children got to school. Amsterdam and many other Dutch cities
demanded an examination of all teachers before being licensed to teach. By
the middle of the seventeenth century a good system of schools seems to
have been provided generally [5] by the Dutch and the Belgian Walloons (R.
178). That the teaching of religion was the main function of the Dutch
elementary schools, as of all other vernacular schools of the time, is
seen from the official lists of the textbooks used (R. 178).

John Knox, the leader of the Scottish Reformation (1560), who had spent
some time at Geneva and who was deeply impressed by the Calvinistic
religious-state found there, introduced the Calvinistic religious and
educational ideas into Scotland. His _Book of Discipline for the Scottish
Church_ (1560), framed closely on the Genevan model, contained a chapter
devoted to education in which he proposed:

    That everie severall churche have a school-maister appointed, such a
    one as is able at least to teach Grammar and the Latin tung, yf the
    Town be of any reputation. Yf it be upaland ... then must either the
    Reider or the Minister take cayre over the children ... to instruct
    them in their first rudementie and especially in the catechisme.

[Illustration: FIG. 100. JOHN KNOX (1505?-72)]

The educational plan proposed by Knox would have called for a large
expenditure of money, and this the thrifty Scotch were not ready for. Knox
and his followers then proposed to endow the new schools from the old
church and monastic foundations, but the Scottish nobles hoped to share in
these, as had the English nobility under Henry VIII, and Knox's plan was
not approved. This delayed the establishment of a real national system of
education for Scotland until the nineteenth century. The new Church,
however, took over the superintendence of education in Scotland, and when
parish schools were finally established by decree of the Privy Council, in
1616, and by the legislation of 1633 and 1646 (R. 179), the Church was
given an important share in their organization and management. These
schools, while not always sufficient in number to meet the educational
needs, were well taught, and have deeply influenced the national
character.


4. _The Counter-Reformation of the Catholics_

THE JESUIT ORDER. The Protestant Revolt made but little headway in Italy,
Spain, Portugal, much of France, or southern Belgium (see map, p. 296).
Italy was scarcely disturbed at all, while in France, where of all these
countries the reform ideas had made greatest progress, nine tenths of the
people remained loyal to Rome. In a general way it may be stated that
those parts of western Europe which had once formed an integral part of
the old Roman Empire remained loyal to the Roman Church, while those which
had been the homes of the Germanic tribes revolted. Now it naturally
happened that the countries which remained loyal to the old Church
experienced none of the feelings of the necessity for education as a means
to personal salvation which the Lutherans and Calvinists felt. There, too,
the church system of education which had developed during the long Middle
Ages remained undisturbed and largely unchanged. The Church as an
institution, though, learned from the Protestants the value of education
as a means to larger ends, and soon set about using it. [6]

After the Church Council of Trent (1545-63), where definite church reform
measures were carried through (p. 303), the Catholics inaugurated what has
since been called a counter-reformation, in an effort to hold lands which
were still loyal and to win back lands which had been lost. Besides
reforming the practices and outward lives of the churchmen, and reforming
some church practices and methods, the Church inaugurated a campaign of
educational propaganda. In this last the chief reliance was upon a new and
a very useful organization officially known as the "Society of Jesus," but
more commonly called the "Jesuit Order." This had been founded, in 1534,
by a Spanish knight, pilgrim, man of large ideas, and scholar by the name
of Ignatius Loyola, and had been sanctioned as an Order of the Church by
Pope Paul III, in 1540. It was organized along strictly military lines,
all members being responsible to its General, and he in turn alone to the
Pope. The quiet life of the cloister was abandoned for a life of open
warfare under a military discipline. The Jesuit was to live in the world,
and all peculiarities of dress or rule which might prove an obstacle to
worldly success were suppressed. The purposes of the Order were to combat
heresy, to advance the interests of the Church, and to strengthen the
authority of the Papacy. Its motto was _Omnia ad Majorem Dei Gloriam_
(that is, All for the greater glory of God), and the means to be employed
by it to accomplish these ends were the pulpit, the confessional, the
mission, and the school. Of these the school was given the place of first
importance. Realizing clearly that the real cause of the Reformation had
been the ignorance, neglect, and vicious lives of so many monks and
priests and the extortion and neglect practiced by the Church, and that
the chief difficulty was in the higher places of authority, it became the
prime principle of the Order to live upright and industrious lives
themselves, and to try to reach and train those likely to be the future
leaders in Church and State. With the education of the masses of the
people the Order was not concerned. [7] Our interest lies only with the
educational work of this Order, a work in which it was remarkably
successful and through which it exercised a very large influence.

[Illustration: FIG. 101. IGNATIUS DE LOYOLA (1491-1556)]

GREAT SUCCESS OF THE ORDER. The service of the Order to the Church in
combating Protestant heresies was very marked. Beginning in a small way,
the Order, by 1600, had established two hundred colleges (Latin secondary
schools), universities, and training seminaries; by 1640, 372; by 1706
(150 years after the death of its founder), 769; and by 1756, 728. In
1773, when the Order was for a time abolished, [8] after it had been
driven out of a number of European countries because of the unscrupulous
methods it adopted and the continual application of its doctrine that the
end justifies the means, the Order had 22,589 members, about half of whom
were teachers. Its colleges (secondary schools) and universities were most
numerous and its work most energetically carried on in northern France,
Belgium, Holland, the German States, Austria, Poland, and Hungary. Here
was the great battle line, and here the Jesuits deeply entrenched
themselves. In these portions of Europe alone there were, in 1750, 217
colleges, 55 seminaries, 24 houses for novitiates, and 160 missions. In
France alone there were 92 colleges. They did much, single-handed, to roll
back the tide of Protestantism which had advanced over half of western
Europe, and to hold other countries true to the ancient faith.

The colleges were usually large and well-supported institutions, with
dormitories, classrooms, dining-halls; and play-grounds. The usual number
of scholars in each was about 300, though some had an attendance of 600 to
800, and a few as high as 2000. At their period of maximum influence the
colleges and universities of the Order probably enrolled a total of
200,000 students. Their graduates were prominent in every scholarly and
governmental activity of the time. As far as possible the pupils were a
selected class to whom the Order offered free instruction. The children of
the nobility and gentry, and the brightest and most promising youths of
the different lands were drawn into their schools. The children of many
Protestants, also, were attracted by the high quality of the instruction
offered. There they were given the best secondary-school education of the
time, and received, at an impressionable age, the peculiar Jesuit stamp.
[9] Bacon gave his opinion as to the success of their instruction in the
following sentence: "As for the pedagogical part, the shortest rule would
be, Consult the schools of the Jesuits; for nothing better has been put in
practice." (_De Augmentis_, VI, 4.) [10]

SUCCESS OF THE JESUIT SCHOOLS. Displaying a genius for organization worthy
of Rome, Loyola and his followers absorbed the best educational ideas of
the time as to school organization and management and curriculum, and
incorporated these into their educational plan. Too practical to make many
changes, but with a keen eye for what was best, they accepted the best and
used it much as others had worked it out. From the municipal college of
Guyenne,  the colleges of Calvin, and Sturm's organization at Strassburg,
they adopted the plan of class organization, with a teacher for each
class. From the Calvinists they obtained the idea of the careful
supervision of instruction, which was worked out in the Prefect of Studies
for their colleges. In their course of study they incorporated the
Ciceronian ideal of the humanistic learning, and as careful religious
instruction as was provided by any of the reformers. From the Italian
court schools they took the idea of physical training. The method of
instruction and classroom management which they worked out was detailed,
practical, and for their purposes excellent. The reasons for their
educational work gave them a clearly defined aim and purpose. The military
brotherhood type of organization, the lifetime of celibate service, and
the opportunity to sort the carefully selected members according to their
ability for service in the different lines of the Order gave them the
best-selected teaching force in Europe, and these men they trained for the
teaching service with a thoroughness unknown before and seldom equaled
since. Knowing why they were at work and what ends they should achieve,
intolerant of opposition, intensely practical in all their work, and
possessed of an indefatigable zeal in the accomplishment of their purpose,
they gave Europe in general and northern continental Europe in particular
a system of secondary schools and universities possessed of a high degree
of effectiveness, which, combined with religious warfare and persecution,
in time drove out or dwarfed all competing institutions in the countries
they were able to control.

That their educational system, viewed from a modern liberal-education
standpoint, equaled in effectiveness for liberal-education ends such
institutions as the court schools of Vittorino da Feltre, Battista da
Guarino, or other Italian humanistic educators of the Renaissance (p.
267); the French and Swiss colleges of Calvin (p. 331); Colet's school at
Saint Paul's (p. 275), and the better English grammar schools; or the
schools of the Brethren of the Common Life in the Netherlands (p. 271);
would hardly be contended for to-day. Such, though, was not their purpose.
To proselyte for the Church rather than to liberalize--from their point of
view there had been too much liberalizing already--was their ultimate aim,
and their educational work was organized to suppress rather than to awaken
more Protestant heresy. The work of this Order was so successful, and for
two centuries so dominated secondary and higher education in Europe, that
it will pay us to examine a little more closely their educational
organization to see more fully the reasons for their large success. In so
doing we will examine three points--their school organization, their
methods of instruction, and the training of their teachers.

JESUIT SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. Each college was presided over by a _Rector_,
who was in effect the president of the institution, and a _Prefect of
Studies_, who was the superintendent of instruction. Below these were the
_Professors_ or teachers, the _House Prefect_, the official disciplinarian
of the institution, known as the _Corrector_, the monitors, and the
students. There were two classes of students, interns and externs. Their
schools were divided into two courses. The _studia inferiora_, or lower
school, which covered the six years from ten to twelve years of age up to
sixteen to eighteen; and the _studia superiora_, which followed, and
included the higher college and university courses, with philosophy and
theology as the important subjects. For the whole, there was a very
carefully worked-out manual of instruction (R. 180) known as the _Ratio
Studiorum_. [11]

The boy entering a Jesuit college was supposed to have previously learned
how to read Latin. The first three years were given to learning Latin
grammar and a little Greek. In the fourth year Latin and Greek authors
were begun, and in the fifth and sixth years a rhetorical study of the
Latin authors was made. Latin was the language of the classroom and the
playground as well, the mother tongue being used only by permission. Greek
was studied through the medium of the Latin. The retention of Latin as the
language of all scholarly and political intercourse, and the cultivation
of the style and speech of Cicero as the standard of purity and elegance,
were the ends aimed at. Careful attention was given to the health and
sports of the pupils, and special regard was paid to moral and religious
training.

Following this lower school of six years came the so-called philosophical
course of three years (sometimes two). The study of the Latin classics and
rhetoric was continued, and dialectics (logic) and some metaphysics were
added. The nine years together covered about the same scope as Sturm's
school (R. 137) at Strassburg (p. 273), but was more formal in character
and partook more of the nature of the later formalized humanistic schools.
Slight variations were allowed in places, to meet particular local needs,
but this course of study remained practically unchanged until 1832, when
some history, geography, and elementary mathematics and science were added
to the lower schools, and advanced mathematics and science to the
philosophical course. In 1906 each Province of the Order was permitted to
change the _Ratio_ further, if necessary to adjust it better to local
needs. Above the philosophical course a course of four or six years in
philosophy and theology prepared for the higher work of the Order, the
four-year course for preaching and the six-year course for teaching.

JESUIT SCHOOL METHODS. The characteristic method of the schools was oral,
with a consequent closeness of contact of teacher and pupils. This
closeness of contact and sympathy was further retained by the system
whereby all punishment was given by the official Corrector of the
institution. Their method, like that of the modern German _Volkschule_,
was distinctly a teaching and not a questioning method. The teacher
planned and gave the instruction; the pupils received it. In the upper
classes the teacher explained the general meaning of the entire passage;
then the construction of each part; then gave the historical,
geographical, and archaeological information needed further to explain the
passage; then called attention to the rhetorical and poetical forms and
rules; then compared the style with that of other writers; and finally
drew the moral lesson. The memory was drilled; but little training of the
judgment or understanding was given. Thoroughness, memory drills, and the
disciplinary value of studies were foundation stones in the Jesuit's
educational theory. Repetition, they said, was the mother of memory. Each
day the work of the previous day was reviewed, and there were further
reviews at the end of each week, month, and year.

To retain the interest of the pupils amid such a load of memorizing
various school devices were resorted to, chief among which were prizes,
ranks, emulations, rivals, and public disputations. The system of rivals,
whereby each boy had an opponent constantly after him, as shown in Figure
102, was one of the peculiar features of their schools. While the schools
were said to have been made pleasant and attractive, the idea of the
absolute authority of the Church which they represented pervaded them and
repressed the development of that individuality which the court schools of
the Italian Renaissance, the schools of the northern humanists, and the
Calvinistic colleges had tried particularly to foster. This, however, is a
criticism made from a modern point of view. That the school represented
well the spirit of the times is indicated by their marked success as
teaching institutions.

[Illustration: FIG. 102. PLAN OF A JESUIT SCHOOLROOM
The pupils were arranged in equal numbers in opposite rows, known as
_decuriae_, and designated by the numbers. Each boy in each row had a
"rival" in the similarly numbered opposite row (one pair is designated by
dots), who rose whenever he was called on to recite, and who tried to
correct him in some error. A monitor for each group sat at _C_, and the
regular teacher at _B. A, D, E, i, o_, and _x_ represent various student
officials.]

TRAINING OF THE JESUIT TEACHER. The newest and the most distinguishing
feature of the Jesuit educational scheme, as well as the most important,
was the care with which they selected and the thoroughness with which they
trained their teachers. To begin with, every Jesuit was a picked man, and
of those who entered the Order only the best were selected for teaching.
Each entered the Order for life, was vowed to celibacy, poverty, chastity,
uprightness of life, and absolute obedience to the commands of the Order.
The six-year inferior course had to be completed, which required that the
boy be sixteen to eighteen years of age before he could take the
preliminary steps toward joining the Order. Then a two-year novitiate,
away from the world, followed. This was a trial of his real character, his
weak points were noted, and his will and determination tested. Many were
dismissed before the end of the novitiate. If retained and accepted, he
took the preliminary vows and entered the philosophical course of study.
On completing this he was from twenty-one to twenty-three years of age. He
was now assigned to teach boys in the inferior classes of some college,
and might remain there. If destined for higher work he taught in the
inferior classes for two or three years, and then entered the theological
course at some Jesuit university. This required four years for those
headed for the ministry, and six for those who were being trained for
professorships in the colleges. On completing this course the final vows
were taken, at an age of from twenty-nine to thirty-two. The training to-
day is still longer. To become a teacher in the inferior classes required
training until twenty-one at least, and for college (secondary) classes
training until at least twenty-nine. The training was in scholarship,
religion, theology, and an apprenticeship in teaching, and was superior to
that required for a teaching license in any Protestant country of Europe,
or in the Catholic Church itself outside of the Jesuit Order.

With such carefully selected and well-educated teachers, themselves models
of upright life in an age when priests and monks had been careless, it is
not surprising that they wielded an influence wholly out of proportion to
their numbers, and supplied Europe with its best secondary schools during
the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. In the loyal Catholic
countries they were virtually the first secondary schools outside of the
monasteries and churches, and the real introduction of humanism into
Spain, Portugal, and parts of France came with the establishment of the
Jesuit humanistic colleges. For their schools they wrote new school books
--the Protestant books, the most celebrated of which were those of
Erasmus, Melanchthon, Sturm, and Lily, were not possible of use--and for
a time they put new life into the humanistic type of education. Before the
eighteenth century, however, their secondary schools had become as formal
as had those in Protestant lands (R. 146), and their universities far more
narrow and intolerant.

The elements of strength and weakness in the Jesuit system of education
has been well summarized by Dabney, [12] in the following words:

    The order of the Jesuits was anti-democratic, and was founded to
    uphold authority, and to antagonize the right of private judgment.
    With masterly skill they ruled the Catholic world for about two
    centuries; and, in the beginning of their activity, performed services
    of great value to mankind. For, although they aimed, in their system
    of education, to fit pupils merely for so-called practical avocations,
    and to avoid all subjects likely to stimulate them to independent
    thought, it was nevertheless the best system which had then appeared.
    In dropping the old scholastic methods, and teaching new and fresher
    subjects, although with the intention of perverting them to their own
    ends, they sowed, in fact, the germs of their own decay. In spite of
    their wonderful organization, and their indefatigable industry as
    courtiers in royal palaces, as professors in the universities, as
    teachers in the schools, as preachers, as confessors, and as
    missionaries, they were utterly unable to crush the spirit of doubt
    and inquiry. During the first half century of their existence they
    were intellectually in advance of their age; but after that they
    gradually dropped behind it, and, instead of diffusing knowledge, saw
    that the only hope of retaining their dominion was to oppose it with
    all their might.

THE CHURCH AND ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. As was stated on a preceding page,
the countries which remained loyal to the Church experienced none of the
Protestant feeling as to the necessity for universal education for
individual salvation. In such lands the church system of education which
had grown up during the Middle Ages remained undisturbed, and was expanded
but slowly with the passage of time. The Church, never having made general
provision for education, was not prepared for such work. Teachers were
scarce, there was no theory of education except the religious theory, and
few knew what to do or how to do it. Many churchmen, too, did not see the
need for doing anything. Nevertheless the Church, spurred on by the new
demands of a world fast becoming modern, and by the exhortations of the
official representatives of the people, [13] now began to make extra
efforts, in the large cathedral cities, to remedy the deficiency of more
than a thousand years. In Paris, for example, which was typical of other
French cities, the Church organized a regular system of elementary
schools, with teachers licensed by the Precentor of the cathedral of Notre
Dame and nominally under his supervision, in which instruction was offered
to children of the artisan and laboring classes, of both sexes, "in
reading, writing, reckoning, the rudiments of Latin Grammar, Catechism,
and singing." By 1675 these "Little Schools" in Paris came to contain
"upwards of 5000 pupils, taught by some 330 masters and mistresses." All
such schools, of course, remained under the immediate control of the
Church, and modern state systems of education in the Catholic States are
late nineteenth-century productions. In Spain, Portugal, Poland, and the
Balkan States, general state systems of education have not even as yet
been evolved.

The general effect of the Reformation, though, was to stimulate the Church
to greater activity in elementary, as well as in secondary and higher
education. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find a large
number of decrees by church councils and exhortations by bishops urging
the extension of the existing church system of education, so as to supply
at least religious training to all the children of the faithful. As a
result a number of teaching orders were organized, the aim of which was to
assist the Church in providing elementary and religious education for the
children of the laboring and artisan classes in the cities.

TEACHING ORDERS ESTABLISHED. The teaching orders for elementary education,
founded before the eighteenth century, with the dates of their foundation,
were:

  * 1535-The Order of Ursulines. (U.S., 1729.)
    1592--The Congregation of Christian Doctrine.
  * 1598--The Sisters of Notre Dame. (U.S., 1847.)
  * 1610--The Visitation Nuns. (U.S., 1799.)
    1621--Patres piarum scholarum (Piarists). First school opened in 1597;
          authorized by the Pope, 1662.
    1627--The Daughters of the Presentation.
  * 1633--The Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. (U.S., 1809.)
    1637--The Port Royalists (Jansenists). (Suppressed in 1661.)
    1643--The Sisters of Providence.
  * 1650--The Sisters of Saint Joseph. Rule based on Jesuits. (U.S.,
          19th C.)
    1652--The Sisters of Mary of Saint Charles Borromeo.
    1684--The Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin.
  * 1684--The Brothers of the Christian Schools. (U.S., 1845.)

    * Have communities in the United States, the date being that of the
    first one established. See _Cyclopedia of Education_, vol. v, p.
    528.

All of these, except the Ursulines and the Piarists, were founded in
France, many of them originating in Paris. The first has long been
prominent in Italy, and is now found in all lands. The second was founded
by Father César de Bus, at Cavaillon, Avignon, in southern France, and its
purpose was to teach the Catechism to the young. The catechetical schools
of this Order were prominent in southern France up to the time of the
French Revolution. The third was founded by the Blessed Peter Fourier
(1565-1640), in 1598, and played an important part in the education of
girls in France, particularly in Lorraine, where Calvinism had made much
headway. This noted Order offered free instruction to tradesmen's
daughters, not only in religion but in "that which concerns this present
life and its maintenance" as well. The girls were taught "reading,
writing, arithmetic, sewing, and divers manual arts, honorable and
peculiarly suitable for girls" of their station of life. At a time when
handwork had not been thought of for boys, the beginnings of such work
were here introduced for girls. In 1640 Fourier gave the sisterhood a
constitution and a rule, which were revised and perfected in 1694. In this
he laid down rules for the organization and management of schools, methods
of teaching the different branches, and provided for a rudimentary form of
class organization. The following extract from the Rule illustrates the
approach to class organization which he devised:

[Illustration: FIG. 103. AN URSULINE
Order founded, 1535]

The inspectress, or mistress of the class, shall endeavor, as far as it
possibly can be carried out, that all the pupils of the same mistress have
each the same book, in order to learn and read therein the same lesson; so
that, whilst one is reading hers in an audible and intelligible voice
before the mistress, all the others, following her and following this
lesson, in their books at the same time, may learn it sooner, more
readily, and more perfectly. [14] The Piarists were established in Italy,
the first school being opened in Rome, in 1597, by a Spanish priest who
had studied at Lerida, Valencia, and Alcalá. Being struck by the lack of
educational opportunities for the poor, he opened a free school for their
instruction. By 1606 he had 900 pupils in his schools, and by 1613 he had
1200. In 1621 Pope Gregory XV gave his work definite recognition by
establishing it a teaching Order for elementary (reading, writing,
counting, religion) education, modeled on that of the Jesuits. The Order
did some work in Italy and Spain, but its chief services were in border
Catholic lands. In 1631 it began work in Moravia, in 1640 in Bohemia, in
1642 in Poland, and after 1648 in Austria and Hungary. The members wore a
habit much like that of the Jesuits, had a scheme of studies similar to
their _Ratio_, and were organized by provinces and were under discipline
as were the members of the older Order.

The Jansenists, founded by Saint Cyran, at Port Royal, conducted a very
interesting and progressive educational experiment, and their schools have
become known to history as the "Little Schools of Port Royal." The
congregation was a reaction against the work and methods of the Jesuits.
It included both elementary and secondary education, but never extended
itself, and probably never had more than sixty pupils and teachers. After
seventeen years of work it was suppressed through the opposition of the
Jesuits, and its members fled to the Netherlands. There they wrote those
books which have explained to succeeding generations what they attempted,
[15] and which have revealed what a modern type of educational experiment
they conducted. The progressive and modern nature of their teaching, in an
age of suspicion and intolerance, condemned them to extinction. Yet
despite the progressive nature of their instruction, the intense religious
atmosphere which they threw about all their work (R. 181) reveals the
dominant characteristic of most education for church ends at the time.

THE BROTHERS OF THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS. The largest and most influential of
the teaching orders established for elementary education was the
"Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools," founded by Father La
Salle at Rouen, in 1684, and sanctioned by the King and Pope in 1724. As
early as 1679 La Salle had begun a school at Rheims, and in 1684 he
organized his disciples, prescribed a costume to be worn, and outlined the
work of the brotherhood (_R. 182_). The object was to provide free
elementary and religious instruction in the vernacular for the children of
the working classes, and to do for elementary education what the Jesuits
had done for secondary education La Salle's _Conduct of Schools_, first
published in 1720, was the _ratio studiorum_ of his order. His work marks
the real beginning of free primary instruction in the vernacular in
France. In addition to elementary schools, a few of what we should call
part-time continuation schools were organized for children engaged in
commerce and industry. Realizing better than the Jesuits the need for
well-trained rather than highly educated teachers for little children, and
unable to supply members to meet the outside calls for schools, La Salle
organized at Rheims, in 1685, what was probably the second normal school
for training teachers in the world. [16] Another was organized later at
Paris. Does Ranjitsinhji provide this definition?"
"No," said I; "I cannot find that he does."
"To be sure he does not; and for the simple reason that these claims
on the side of the public are growing year by year.

Already no one can say how much they cover, and assuredly no one can say
where they are likely to stop. You observe that our author includes even
University matches under the head of exhibition cricket, in which
obligations towards the spectators have to be taken into account. You
remember the scene at Lord's in 1893 when Wells purposely bowled
no-balls; and again in 1896 when Shine bowled two no-balls to the boundary
and then a ball which went for four byes, the object in each case being
to deprive Oxford of the follow-on. This policy was hotly discussed;
and luckily the discussion spent itself on the question whether play
could be at the same time within the laws and clean contrary to the
ethics of cricket. But there was also a deal of talk about what was
'due to the public'; talk which would have been altogether wide of the
mark in the old days, when Oxford and Cambridge met to play a mere friendly
match and the result concerned them alone."
"And is this," I asked, "the sum of your indictment?"
"Yes, I think that is all. And surely it is enough."
"Then, as I make out, your chief objections to spectacular cricket
are two. You hold that it gives vast numbers of people a false idea that
they are joining in a sport when in truth they are doing no more
than look on.

And you contend that as the whole institution resolves itself
more and more into a paid exhibition, the spectators will tend more and
more to direct the development of the game; whereas cricket in
your opinion should be uninfluenced by those who are outside the
ropes?"

"That is my case."
"And I think, my dear Verinder, it is a strong one. But there is just one
little point which you do not appear to have considered. And I was coming
to it just now--or rather Prince Ranjitsinhji was coming to it--when
you interrupted us. 'From a purely cricket point of view,' he was saying,
'not much can be said against exhibition cricket.' And in the next
sentence he goes on: 'At any rate it promotes skill in the game and
keeps up the standard of excellence.'"
"To be sure it does that."
"And cricket is played by the best players to-day with more skill than
it was by the best players of twenty or forty years ago?"
"Yes, I believe that; in spite of all we hear about the great Alfred
Mynn and other bygone heroes."
"Come then," said I, "tell me, Is Cricket an art?"
"Decidedly it is."
"Then Cricket, like other arts, should aim at perfection?"
"I suppose so."
"And that will be the highest aim of Cricket--its own perfection?

And its true lovers should welcome whatever helps to make it perfect?"

"I see what you are driving at," said he.

"But Cricket is a social art, and must be judged by the good it does to
boys and men. You, I perceive, make it an art-in-itself, and would treat
it as the gardeners treat a fine chrysanthemum, nipping off a hundred
buds to feed and develop a single perfect bloom."
"True: we must consider it also as a social art. But, my dear fellow,
are you not exaggerating the destruction necessary to produce the perfect
bloom? You talk of the crowd at Lord's or the Oval as if all these thousands
were diverted from honest practice of the game to the ignoble occupation
of looking on; whereas two out of three of them, were this spectacle not
provided, would far more likely be attending a horse-race, or betting
in clubs and public-houses. The bricklayer, the stockbroker, the
archdeacon, by going to see Lockwood bowl, depopulate no village
green. You judge these persons by yourself, and tell yourself reproachfully
that but for this attraction _you_, John Verinder, would be creditably
perspiring at a practice-net in Tooting or Dulwich; whereas, the truth is--"

"Why are you hesitating?"
"Because it is not a very pleasant thing to say. But the truth is, your
heart and your conscience in this matter of athletics are a little
younger than your body."
"You mean that I am getting on for middle age."
"I mean that, though you talk of it, you will never subscribe to
that suburban club.

You will marry; you will be made a judge: you will attend cricket
matches, and watch from the pavilion while your son takes block for his
first score against the M.C.C.

"And when with envy Time transported, Shall think to rob us of our joys,
I, with my girls (if I ever have any), will sit on the top of a drag
(if I ever acquire one) and teach them at what to applaud, While you go
a-batting with your boys."
Verinder pulled a wry face, and the Boy smacked him on the back and exhorted
him to "buck up."
"And the round world will go on as before, and the sun will patrol Her
Majesty's dominions, and still where the Union Jack floats he will
pass the wickets pitched and white-flannelled Britons playing for all
they are worth, while men of subject races keep the score-sheet. And still
when he arrives at this island he will look down on green closes and
approve what we all allow to be one of the most absolutely gracious
sights on earth-- the ordered and moving regiments of schoolboys at cricket.
Grayson, reach round to that shelf against which your chair is tilted;
take down poor Lefroy's poems, and read us that sonnet of his, 'The Bowler.'"

Grayson found the book and the place, and read:--
"Two minutes' rest till the next man goes in!

The tired arms lie with every sinew slack On the mown grass. Unbent the
supple back, And elbows apt to make the leather spin Up the slow bat and
round the unwary shin,-- In knavish hands a most unkindly knack; But no
guile shelters under the boy's black Crisp hair, frank eyes, and honest
English skin.
Two minutes only! Conscious of a name, The new man plants his weapon with
profound Long-practised skill that no mere trick may scare.
Not loth, the rested lad resumes the game:
The flung ball takes one maddening, tortuous bound, And the mid-stump three
somersaults in air!"
"Topping!" the Boy ejaculated. "Who wrote it?"
"His name was Lefroy. He died young. He left Oxford a few years before we
went up. And I think," continued Verinder, musing, "that I, who detest
making acquaintances, would give at this moment a considerable sum to have
known him. Well," he continued, turning to me and puffing at his
pipe, "so you warn Grayson and me that we must prepare to relinquish
these and all the other delights sung by Lefroy and Norman Gale
and that other poet--anonymous, but you know the man--in his
incomparable parody of Whitman: 'the perfect feel of a fourer'--

"'The thousand melodious cracks, delicious cracks, the responsive
echoes of my comrades and the hundred thence resulting runs,
passionately yearned for, never, never again to be forgotten.

"'Overhead meanwhile the splendid silent sun, blending all, fusing all,
bathing all in floods of soft ecstatic perspiration.'
"--To all this we must say good-bye. And what do you offer us in exchange?"

"Merely the old consolation that life is short, art is long; that while
you grow old, cricket in other hands will be working out its perfection,
and your son, when you have one, will start with higher ideals than you
ever dreamed of."

"And this perfection--will it ever be attained?"
"I dare say never.

For perhaps we may say after Plato, and without irreverence, that the
pattern of perfect cricket is laid up somewhere in the skies, and out of
man's reach. But between it and ordinary cricket we may set up a copy
of perfection, as close as man can make it, and, by little and little,
closer every year. This copy will be preserved, and cared for, and advanced,
by those professional cricketers against whom the unthinking have so
much to say; by these and by the few amateurs who, as time goes on, will
be found able to bear the strain. For the search after perfection is
no light one, and will admit of no half-hearted service.
I say nothing here of material rewards, beyond reminding you that
your professional cricketer is poorly paid in comparison with an inferior
singer of the music-halls, although he gives twice as much pleasure as
your _lion comique_, and of a more innocent kind. But he does more than
this. He feeds and guards the flame of art; and when his joints are
stiff and his vogue is past, he goes down as groundman and instructor to a
public school, and imparts to a young generation what knowledge he can of
the high mysteries whose servant he has been: quite like the philosopher
in the _Republic_--"
"Steady on!" interposed Grayson. "How on earth will the Boy stand up
to Briggs' bowling if you put these notions in his head? He'll be
awe-struck, and begin to fidget with his right foot."

"Oh, fire ahead!"

said that cheerful youth. He had possessed himself of Prince Ranjitsinhji's
book and coiled himself comfortably into a wicker chair.--"You're only
rotting, I know. And you've passed over the most important sentence in the
whole book.

Listen to this: 'There are very few newspaper readers who do not turn to
the cricket column first when the morning journal comes; who do
not buy a halfpenny evening paper to find out how many runs W.G.
or Bobby Abel has made.'

That's the long and short of the matter. Verinder, which do you read
first in your morning paper-- the Foreign Intelligence or the
Cricket News?"

THE SECOND DIALOGUE. 1905.

A few days ago--to be precise, on Saturday the 24th of this month--my
friend Verinder reminded me of the long-past conversation.

We had met by appointment at Paddington to travel down to Windsor for
the second day of the Eton and Winchester match, taking with us
(or rather, being taken by) a youngster whom we call The Infant.

The Infant, who talks little save in the bosom of his family, and even so
preserves beneath his talk that fine reticence of judgment which
most adorns the age of fifteen, not unfrequently surprises me by
his experiments in the art of living.

On this occasion, while I was engaged in the booking-office and Verinder
in scanning the shelves of Messrs. Smith's bookstall, he had found
our train, chosen our compartment, and laid out twopence in four halfpenny
papers, which he spread on the cushions by way of reserving our
seats.

"But why four," I asked, "seeing there are but three of us?"
"It will give us more room," he answered simply.

He had hoped, I doubt not, by this devise to retain the whole
compartment; but the hope was soon and abruptly frustrated by a
tall, well-dressed and pompous man who came striding down the
platform while we idled by the door, and thrusting past us almost
before we could give way, entered the compartment, dropped into a
corner seat, tossed his copy of _The Times_ on to the seat opposite,
took off his top-hat, examined it, replaced it when satisfied of
its shine, drew out a spare handkerchief, opened it, flicked a few
specks of dust from his patent-leather boots, looked up while
reaching across for _The Times_, recognised me with a nod and a
"Good morning!"

and buried himself in his paper.

I on my part, almost before glancing at his face, had recognised him by
his manner for a personage next to whom it has been my lot to sit
at one or two public banquets.

I will call him Sir John Crang. He is a K.C.M.G., a Colonial by birth and
breeding, a Member of Parliament, and a person of the sort we treat in
these days with consideration.

Since the second year of Jubilee (in which he was knighted) he and his
kind have found themselves at ease in Sion, and of his kind he has been
perhaps the most fortunate.

In his public speeches he alludes to himself humorously as a hustler.
He has married a wealthy lady, in every other respect too good for him,
entertains largely at dinners which should be private but are
reported in the press, and advocates conscription for the youth of
Great Britain.

Upon conscription for his native colony, as upon any other of its duties
towards Imperial defence, if you question him, you will find him sonorously
evasive.

The Infant, accustomed to surprise at the extent of my acquaintance,
gazed at him politely for a moment as we took our seats and the
train moved out of the station.

I noted a veiled disapproval in his eye as he picked up a newspaper,
and at that moment Verinder, who had picked up another, emitted a
noise not unlike the snort of the engine as it gathered speed. I glanced
at him in some apprehension.

Verinder's bearing toward strangers is apt to be brutal, and by an instinct
acquired as his companion on old reading-parties I was prepared to be
apologetic.

His ill-humour, however, had nothing to do with Sir John Crang. He
had laid the newspaper across his knee, and was pointing to it
with a scornful forefinger.

  "Look here," he said. "Do you remember a talk we had some
  years ago--you and I and Grayson? It started in D--'s shop
  one afternoon after a Kent and Middlesex match. You ought
  to remember, for I picked up the _Pall Mall Magazine_ a
  month later and found you had made copy out
  of it."
  "To be sure," said I. "We discussed cricket, and a number of reputations
       then
  well known, about which the public troubles itself no longer.

Let us try their names upon The Infant here, and discover with how
many of them he is acquainted."

"We discussed," said Verinder, "the vulgarisation of cricket.

You made me say some hard things about it, but be hanged to me if
anything I prophesied then came near to _this_!

Listen--
"'I suppose I may say that, after some luck at starting, I played
a pretty good innings: but a total of 240 is poor enough for first
knock on such a wicket as Hove, and, as things stand, the omens are
against us.

However, as I write this wire the clouds are gathering, and there's
no denying that a downfall during the night may help our chances.'"

"What on earth are you reading?" I asked.

"Stay a moment. Here's another--
"'With Jones's wicket down, the opposition declared, somewhat to
the annoyance of the crowd: and indeed, with Robinson set and playing
the prettiest strokes all around the wicket, I must admit that they
voiced a natural disappointment.

They had paid their money, and, after the long period of stonewalling
which preceded the tea interval, a crowded hour of glorious life
would have been exhilarating, and perhaps was no more than their due.

  Dickson, however, took his barracking good-humouredly. Towards
  the end Jones had twice appealed against the
  light.'"
  "I suppose," said I, "that is how cricket strikes the Yellow Press.
  
    Who are the
  reporters?"
    "The reporters
  are the captains of two county teams--two
  first-class county teams; and they are writing of a match actually in
    progress at this moment. Observe A.'s
  fine sense of loyalty to a captain's duty in his published opinion
that his side is in a bad way.

Remark his chivalrous hope for a sodden wicket to-morrow."

"It is pretty dirty," I agreed.

Verinder snorted. "I once tried to kill a man at mid-on for wearing a
pink shirt. But these fellows! They ought to wear yellow flannels."
"What, by the way, is the tea interval?" I asked.

"It is an interval," answered Verinder seriously, "in which the opposing
captains adjourn to the post office and send telegrams about themselves
and one another."
"Excuse me," put in Sir John Crang, looking up from his _Times_ and addressing
me, "but I quite agree with what you and your friend are saying. Interest
in the Australian tour, for instance, I can understand; it promotes good
feeling, and anything that draws closer the bonds of interest between
ourselves and the colonies is an imperial asset."
"Good Lord!" murmured Verinder.

Sir John fortunately did not hear him. "But I agree with you," he continued,
"in condemning this popular craze for cricket _per se_, which is after
all but a game with a ball and some sticks. I will not go the length
of our imperial poet and dub its votaries 'flannelled fools.' That was
poetical license, eh? though pardonable under the circumstances.
But, as he has said elsewhere, 'How little they know of England who
only England know.'" (At this point I reached out a foot and trod hard
on Verinder's toe.) "And to the broader outlook--I speak as a pretty wide
traveller--this insular absorption in a mere game is bewildering."
"Infant!" said Verinder suddenly, still under repression of my foot,
"What are you reading?"
The Infant looked up sweetly, withdrawing himself from his paper,
however, by an effort.

"There's a Johnny here who tells you how Bosanquet bowls with what he calls
his 'over-spin.' He has a whole column about it with figures, just like
Euclid; and the funny thing is, Bosanquet writes just after to say that the
Johnny knows nothing about it."
"Abandoned child," commanded Verinder, "pass me the paper. You are within
measurable distance of studying cricket for its own sake, and will
come to a bad end."
Within twenty seconds he and The Infant were intently studying the
diagrams, which Verinder demonstrated to be absurd, while Sir John, a
little huffed by his manner, favoured me with a vision of England as she
should be, with her ploughshares beaten into Morris Tubes.

In the midst of this discourse Verinder looked up.

"Let us not despair of cricket," says he. "She has her victories,
but as yet no prizes to be presented with public speeches."
"Curious fellow that friend of yours," said Sir John, as he took leave
of me on Windsor platform. "Yes, yes, I saw how you humoured him: but why
should he object to a man's playing cricket in a pink shirt?"
He went on his way toward the Castle, while we turned our faces for
Agar's Plough and the best game in the world.

JULY.

Our Parliamentary Candidate--or Prospective Candidate, as we
cautiously call him--has been visiting us, and invited me to sit
on the platform and give the speeches my moral support.

I like our candidate, who is young, ardent, good-natured, and keeps
his temper when he is heckled; seems, indeed, to enjoy being heckled,
and conciliates his opponents by that bright pugnacity which a true
Briton loves better than anything else in politics.

I appreciate, too, the compliment he pays me. But I wish he would not
choose to put his ardour in competition with Sirius and the dog-days;
and I heartily wish he had not brought down Mr. Blank, M.P., to address us
in his support.

Mr. Blank and I have political opinions which pass, for convenience, under
a common label. Yet there are few men in England whose attitude of mind
towards his alleged principles I more cordially loathe. Not to put too
fine a point upon it, I think him a hypocrite. But he has chosen the side
which is mine, and I cannot prevent his saying a hundred things which I
believe.

We will suppose that Mr. Blank is a far honester fellow than I am
able to think him.

Still, and at the best, he is a sort of composite photograph of your
average Member of Parliament--the type of man to whom Great Britain
commits the direction of her affairs and, by consequence, her
well-doing and her well-being and her honour.

Liberal or Conservative, are not the features pretty much the same? a
solid man, well past fifty, who has spent the prime of his life in
business and withdrawn from it with a good reputation and a credit
balance equally satisfactory to himself and his bankers. Or it may be that
he has not actually retired but has turned to politics to fill up those
leisure hours which are the reward or vexation (as he chooses to look
at them) of a prosperous man of business; for, as Bagehot pointed out,
the life of a man of business who employs his own capital, and employs
it nearly always in the same way, is by no means fully employed. "If
such a man is very busy, it is a sign of something wrong. Either he is
working at detail, which subordinates would do better, or he is engaged
in too many speculations." In consequence our commerce abounds with men
of great business ability and experience who, being short of occupation,
are glad enough to fill up their time with work in Parliament, as well as
proud to write M.P. after their names.
For my part I can think of nothing better calculated to reassure anyone
whose dreams are haunted by apprehensions of wild-cat legislative schemes,
or the imminence of a Radical millennium, than five minutes' contemplation
of our champions of progress as they recline together, dignified and
whiskered and bland, upon the benches of St. Stephen's.

But let us proceed with our portrait, which I vow is a most pleasing
one.
Our typical legislator is of decent birth, or at least hopeful of
acquiring what he rightly protests to be but 'the guinea stamp' by
judiciously munificent contributions to his party's purse; honest
and scrupulous in dealing; neither so honest nor so scrupulous in
thinking; addicted to phrases and a trifle too impatient of their
meaning, yet of proved carefulness in drawing the line between
phrase and practice; a first-rate committeeman (and only those who
have sat long in committee can sound the depths of this praise);
locally admired; with much _bonhomie_ of manner, backed by a
reputation for standing no nonsense; good-tempered, honestly anxious
to reconcile conflicting interests and do the best for the unconflicting
ones of himself and his country; but above all a man who knows where
to stop.

I vow (I repeat) he makes a dignified and amiable figure. One can easily
understand why people like to be represented by such a man. It gives a
feeling of security--a somewhat illusory one, I believe; and security
is the first instinct of a state. One can understand, why the exhortations,
dehortations, precepts, and instructions of parents, preachers, schoolmasters
tend explicitly and implicitly to the reproduction of this admired
bloom.

Yet one may whisper that it has--shall we say?--its failings; and its
failings are just those which are least to be commended to the
emulation of youth.

It is, for instance, constitutionally timid.
[Illustration: FIG. 109. NEW ENGLAND SETTLEMENTS, 1660]

At first, English precedents were followed. Home instruction, which was
quite common in England among the Puritans, was naturally much employed to
teach the children to read the Bible and to train them to participate in
both the family and the congregational worship. After 1647, town
elementary schools under a master, and later the English "dame schools"
(chapter XVIII), were established to provide this rudimentary instruction.
The English apprentice system was also established (R. 201), and the
masters of apprentices gave similar instruction to boys entrusted to their
care. The town religious governments, under which all the little
congregations organized themselves, much as the little religious parishes
had been organized in old England, also began the voluntary establishment
of town grammar schools, as a few towns in England had done (R. 143)
before the Puritans migrated. The "Latin School" at Boston dates from
1635, and has had a continuous existence since that time. The grammar
school at Charlestown dates from 1636, that at Ipswich from the same year,
and the school at Salem from 1637. In 1639 Dorchester voted:

    that there shall be a rent of 20 lb a year for ever imposed upon
    Tomsons Island ... toward the mayntenance of a schoole in Dorchester.
    This rent of 20 lb yearly to bee payd to such a schoole-master as
    shall vndertake to teach english, latine, and other tongues, and also
    writing. The said schoole-master to bee chosen from tyme to tyme p'r
    the freemen.

Newbury, in 1639, voted "foure akers of upland" and "sixe akers of salt
marsh" to Anthony Somerby "for his encouragement to keepe schoole for one
yeare," and later levied a town rate of £24 for a "schoole to be kepte at
the meeting house." Cambridge also early established a Latin grammar
school "for the training up of Young Schollars, and fitting them [5] for
_Academicall Learning_" (R. 185).

The support for the town schools thus founded was derived from various
sources, such as the levying of tuition fees, the income from town lands
or fisheries set aside for the purpose, [6] voluntary contributions from
the people of the town, [7] a town tax, or a combination of two or more of
these methods. The founding of the "free (grammar) school" at Roxburie, in
1645, is representative (R. 188) of the early methods. There was no
uniform plan as yet, in either old or New England.

FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE. In addition to establishing Latin grammar
schools, a college was founded, in 1636, by the General Court
(legislature) of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to perpetuate learning and
insure an educated ministry (R. 185) to the churches after "our present
ministers shall lie in the dust." This new college, located at Newtowne,
was modeled after Emmanuel College at Cambridge, an English Puritan
college in which many of the early New England colonists had studied, [8]
and in loving memory of which they rechristened Newtowne as Cambridge. In
1639 the college was christened Harvard College, after a graduate of
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, by the name of John Harvard, who died in
Charlestown, a year after his arrival in the colony, and who left the
college his library of two hundred and sixty volumes and half his
property, about £850.

The instruction in the new college was a combination of the arts and
theological instruction given in a mediaeval university, though at Harvard
the President, Master Dunster (R. 185), did all the teaching. For the
first fifty years at Harvard this continued to be true, the attendance
during that time seldom exceeding twenty. The entrance requirements for
the college (R. 186 a) call for the completion of a typical English Latin
grammar-school education; the rules and precepts for the government of the
college (R. 186 b) reveal the deep religious motive; and the schedule of
studies (R. 186 c) and the requirements for degrees (R. 186 d) both show
that the instruction was true to the European type. In the charter for the
college, granted by the colonial legislature in 1650 (R. 187 a), we find
exemptions and conditions which remind one strongly of the older European
foundations. A century later Brown College, in Rhode Island, was granted
even more extensive exemptions (R. 187 b).

THE FIRST COLONIAL LEGISLATION: THE LAW OF 1642. We thus see manifested
early in New England the deep Puritan-Calvinistic zeal for learning as a
bulwark of Church and State. We also see the establishment in the
wilderness of New England of a typical English educational system--that
is, private instruction in reading and religion by the parents in the home
and by the masters of apprentices, and later by a town schoolmaster; the
Latin grammar school in the larger towns, to prepare boys for the college
of the colony; and an English-type college to prepare them for the
ministry. As in England, too, all was clearly subordinate to the Church.
Still further, as in England also, the system was voluntary, the deep
religious interest which had brought the congregations to America being
depended upon to insure for all the necessary education and religious
training.

It early became evident, though, that these voluntary efforts on the part
of the people and the towns would not be sufficient to insure that general
education which was required by the Puritan religious theory. Under the
hard pioneer conditions, and the suffering which ensued, many parents and
masters of apprentices evidently proved neglectful of their educational
duties. Accordingly the Church appealed to its servant, the State, as
represented in the colonial legislature (General Court) to assist it in
compelling parents and masters to observe their religious obligations. The
result was the famous Massachusetts Law of 1642 (R. 190), which directed
"the chosen men" (Selectmen; Councilmen) of each town to ascertain, from
time to time, if the parents and masters were attending to their
educational duties; if the children were being trained "in learning and
labor and other employments ... profitable to the Commonwealth"; and if
children were being taught "to read and understand the principles of
religion and the capital laws of the country," and empowered them to
impose fines on "those who refuse to render such accounts to them when
required." In 1645 the General Court further ordered that all youth
between ten and sixteen years of age should also receive instruction "in
ye exercise of arms, as small guns, halfe pikes, bowes & arrows, &c."

UNIVERSITY

The Law of 1642 is remarkable in that, for the first time in the English-
speaking world, a legislative body representing the State ordered that all
children should be taught to read. The law shows clearly not only the
influence of the Reformation theory as to personal salvation and the
Calvinistic conception of the connection between learning and religion,
but also the influence of the English Poor-Law legislation which had
developed rapidly during the half-century immediately preceding the coming
of the Puritans to America (R. 173). On the foundations of the English
Poor Law of 1601 (R. 174) our New England settlers moulded the first
American law relating to education, adding to the principles there
established (p. 326) a distinct Calvinistic contribution to our new-world
life that, the authorities of the civil town should see that all children
were taught "to read and understand the principles of religion and the
capital laws of the country." This law the Selectmen, or the courts if
they failed to do so, were ordered to enforce, and the courts usually
looked after their duties in the matter (R. 192).

_The Law of 1647._ The Law of 1642, while ordering "the chosen men" of
each town to see that the education and training of children was not
neglected, and providing for fines on parents and masters who failed to
render accounts when required, did not, however, establish schools, or
direct the employment of schoolmasters. The provision of education, after
the English fashion, was still left with the homes. After a trial of five
years, the results of which were not satisfactory, the General Court
enacted another law by means of which it has been asserted that "the
Puritan government of Massachusetts rendered probably its greatest service
to the future."

After recounting in a preamble (R. 191) that it had in the past been "one
cheife proiect of y't ould deluder, Satan, to keepe men from the knowledge
of y'e Scriptures, ... by keeping y'm in an unknowne tongue," so now "by
pswading from y'e use of tongues," and "obscuring y'e true sence & meaning
of y'e originall" by "false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers," learning
was in danger of being "buried in y'e grave of o'r fath'rs in y'e church
and comonwealth"; the Court ordered:

    1. That every town having fifty householders should at once appoint a
       teacher of reading and writing, and provide for his wages in such
       manner as the town might determine; and

    2. That every town having one hundred householders must provide a
       grammar school to fit youths for the university, under a penalty of
       £5 (afterwards increased to £20) for failure to do so.

This law represents a distinct step in advance over the Law of 1642, and
for this there are no English precedents. It was not until the latter part
of the nineteenth century that England took such a step. The precedents
for the compulsory establishment of schools lie rather in the practices of
the different German States (p. 318), the actions of the Dutch synods (R.
176) and provinces (p. 335), the Acts of the Scottish parliament of 1633
and 1646 (p. 334; R. 179), and the general Calvinistic principle that
education was an important function of a religious State.

PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED. The State here, acting again as the servant of the
Church, enacted a law and fixed a tradition which prevailed and grew in
strength and effectiveness after State and Church had parted company. Not
only was a school system ordered established--elementary for all towns and
children, and secondary for youths in the larger towns--but, for the first
time among English-speaking people, there was an assertion of the right of
the State to require communities to establish and maintain schools, under
penalty if they refused to do so. It can be safely asserted, in the light
of later developments, that the two laws of 1642 and 1647 represent the
foundations upon which our American state public-school systems have been
built. Mr. Martin, the historian of the Massachusetts public-school
system, states the fundamental principles which underlay this legislation,
as follows: [9]

    1. The universal education of youth is essential to the well-being of
       the State.

    2. The obligation to furnish this education rests primarily upon the
       parent.

    3. The State has a right to enforce this obligation.

    4. The State may fix a standard which shall determine the kind of
       education, and the minimum amount.

    5. Public money, raised by general tax, may be used to provide such
       education as the State requires. The tax may be general, though the
       school attendance is not.

    6. Education higher than the rudiments may be supplied by the State.
       Opportunity must be provided, at public expense, for youths who
       wish to be fitted for the university.

"It is important to note here," adds Mr. Martin, "that the idea underlying
all this legislation is neither paternalistic nor socialistic. The child
is to be educated, not to advance his personal interests, but because the
State will suffer if he is not educated. The State does not provide
schools to relieve the parent, nor because it can educate better than the
parent can, but because it can thereby better enforce the obligation which
it imposes." To prevent a return to the former state of religious
ignorance it was important that education be provided. To assure this the
colonial legislature enacted a law requiring the maintenance and support
of schools by the towns. This law became the corner-stone of our American
state school systems.

Influence on other New England colonies. Connecticut Colony, in its Law of
1650 establishing a school system, combined the spirit of the
Massachusetts Law of 1642, though stated in different words (R. 193), and
the Law of 1647, stated word for word. New Haven Colony, in 1655, ordered
that children and apprentices should be taught to read, as had been done
in Massachusetts, in 1642, but on the union of New Haven and Connecticut
Colonies, in 1665, the Connecticut Code became the law for the united
colonies. In 1702 a college was founded (Yale) and finally located at New
Haven, to offer preparation for the ministry in the Connecticut colony, as
had been done earlier in Massachusetts, and Latin grammar schools were
founded in the Connecticut towns to prepare for the new college, as also
had been done earlier in Massachusetts. The rules and regulations for the
grammar school at New Haven (R. 189) reveal the purpose and describe the
instruction provided in one of the earliest and best of these.

[Illustration: FIG. 111. WHERE YALE COLLEGE WAS FOUNDED]

Plymouth Colony, in 1658 and again in 1663, proposed to the towns that
they "sett vp" a schoolmaster "to traine vp children to reading and
writing" (R. 194 a). In 1672 the towns were asked to aid Harvard College
by gifts (R. 194 b). In 1673-74 the income from the Cape Cod fisheries was
set aside for the support of a (grammar) school (R. 194 c). Finally, in
1677, all towns having over fifty families and maintaining a grammar
school were ordered aided from the fishery proceeds (R. 194 d).

The Massachusetts laws also applied to Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,
as these were then a part of Massachusetts Colony. After New Hampshire
separated, in 1680, the Massachusetts Law of 1647 was virtually readopted
in 1719-21. In Maine and Vermont there were so few settlers, until near
the beginning of our national life, that the influence of the
Massachusetts legislation on these States was negligible until a later
period.

Only in Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, of all the New England
colonies, did the Massachusetts legislation fail to exert a deep
influence. Settled as these two had been by refugees from New England, and
organized on a basis of hospitality to all who suffered from religious
oppression elsewhere, the religious stimulus to the founding of schools
naturally was lacking. As the religious basis for education was as yet the
only basis, the first development of schools in Rhode Island awaited the
humanitarian and economic influences which did not become operative until
early in the nineteenth century.

Outside of the New England colonies, the appeal to the State as the
servant of the Church was seldom made during the early colonial period,
the churches handling the educational problem in their own way. As a
result the beginnings of State oversight and control were left to New
England. In the central colonies a series of parochial-school systems came
to prevail, while in Episcopalian Virginia and the other colonies to the
south the no-business-of-the-State attitude assumed toward education by
the mother country was copied.

THE CHURCH SCHOOLS OF NEW YORK. New Netherland, as New York Colony was
called before the English occupation, was settled by the Dutch West India
Company, and some dozen villages about New York and up the Hudson had been
founded by the time it passed to the control of the English, in 1664. In
these the Dutch established typical home-land public parochial schools,
under the control of the Reformed Dutch Church. The schoolmaster was
usually the reader and precentor in the church as well (R. 195), and often
acted, as in Holland, as sexton besides. Girls attended on equal terms
with boys, but sat apart and recited in separate classes. The instruction
consisted of reading and writing Dutch, sometimes a little arithmetic, the
Dutch Catechism, the reading of a few religious books, and certain
prayers. The rules (1661) for a schoolmaster in New Amsterdam (R. 196),
and the contract with a Dutch schoolmaster in Flatbush (R. 195), dating
from 1682, reveal the type of schools and school conditions provided. All
except the children of the poor paid fees to the schoolmaster. [10] He was
licensed by the Dutch church authorities. As the Dutch had not come to
America because of persecution, and were in no way out of sympathy with
religious conditions in the home-land, the schools they developed here
were typical of the Dutch European parochial schools of the time (R. 178).
A _trivial_ (Latin) school was also established in New York, in 1652.

After the English occupation the English principle of private and church
control of education, with schooling on a tuition or a charitable basis,
came to prevail, and this continued up to the beginning of our national
period. [11] Of the English colonial schools of New York Draper has
written: [12]

    All the English schools in the province from 1700 down to the time of
    the Declaration of Independence were maintained by a great religious
    society organized under the auspices of the Church of England--and, of
    course, with the favor of the government--called "The Society for the
    Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts." The law governing this
    Society provided that no teacher should be employed until he had
    proved "his affection for the present government" and his "conformity
    to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England." Schools
    maintained under such auspices were in no sense free schools. Indeed,
    humiliating as it is, no student of history can fail to discern the
    fact that the government of Great Britain, during its supremacy in
    this territory, did nothing to facilitate the extension or promote the
    efficiency of free elementary schools among the people.

THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS OF PENNSYLVANIA. Pennsylvania was settled by
Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, German Lutherans, Moravians,
Mennonites, and members of the German Reformed Church, all of whom came to
America to secure greater religious liberty and had been attracted to this
colony by the freedom of religious worship which Penn had provided for
there. All these were Protestant sects, all believed in the necessity of
learning to read the Bible as a means to personal salvation, and all made
efforts looking toward the establishment of schools as a part of their
church organization. Unlike New England, though, no sect was in a
majority; church control for each denomination was considered as most
satisfactory; and no appeal was made to the State to have it assist the
churches in the enforcement of their religious purposes. The clergymen
were usually the teachers in the parochial schools established, [13] while
private pay schools were opened in the villages and towns. These were
taught in English, German, or the Moravian tongue (Czech), according to
the original language of the different immigrants. The Quakers seem to
have taken particular interest in schools (R. 199), a Quaker school in
Philadelphia (R. 198) having been established the year the city was
founded. Girls were educated as well as boys, and the emphasis was placed
on reading, writing, counting, and religion, rather than upon any higher
form of training.

[Illustration: FIG. 112. AN OLD QUAKER MEETING-HOUSE AND SCHOOL AT
LAMPETER, PENNSYLVANIA
(From an old drawing)]

The result was the development in this colony of a policy of depending on
church and private effort, and the provision of education, aside from
certain rudimentary and religious instruction, was left largely for those
who could afford to pay for the privilege. Charitable education was
extended to but a few, for a short time, while, under the freedom allowed,
many communities made but indifferent provisions or suffered their schools
to lapse. Under the primitive conditions of the time the interest even in
religious education often declined almost to the vanishing point. So lax
in the matter of providing schooling had many communities become that the
second Provincial Assembly, sitting in Philadelphia, in 1683, passed an
ordinance requiring (R. 197) that all persons having children must cause
them to be taught to read and write, so that they might be able to read
the Scriptures by the time they were twelve years old, and also that all
children be taught some useful trade. A fine of £5 was to be assessed for
failure to comply with the law. So much in advance of English ideas as to
what was fitting and proper was this compulsory law that it was vetoed by
William and Mary, when submitted to their majesties for approval. Ten
years later it was reënacted by the Governor and Assembly of the colony,
but proved so difficult of enforcement that it was soon dropped, and the
chance of starting education in Pennsylvania somewhat after the New
England model was lost. The colony now settled down to a policy of non
state action, and this in time became so firmly established that the do-
as-you-please idea persisted in this State up to the establishment of the
first free state school system, in 1834.

MIXED CONDITIONS IN NEW JERSEY. In New Jersey, situated as it was near the
center of the different colonies, the early development of education there
was the product of a number of different influences. The Dutch crossed
from New Amsterdam, the English came from Connecticut and later from New
York, Scotch and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians came from the mother country,
Swedish Lutherans settled along the Delaware, and Quakers and German
Lutherans came over from Pennsylvania. The educational practice of the
colony or land from which each group of settlers came was reproduced in
the colony. After the English succeeded the Dutch in New Amsterdam (1664),
English methods and practice in education gradually came into control
throughout most of New Jersey, and as a result here, as in New York, but
little was accomplished in providing schools for other than a select few
until well after the beginning of the nineteenth century. Neither New
Jersey, New York, nor Pennsylvania may be said to have developed any
colonial educational policy aside from that of allowing private and
parochial effort to provide such schools as seemed desirable.

VIRGINIA AND THE SOUTHERN TYPE. Almost all the conditions attending the
settlement of Virginia were in contrast to those of the New England
colonies. The early settlers were from the same class of English yeomen
and country squires, but with the important difference that whereas the
New England settlers were Dissenters from the Church of England and had
come to America to obtain freedom in religious worship, the settlers in
Virginia were adherents of the National Church and had come to America for
gain. The marked differences in climate and possible crops led to the
large plantation type of settlement, instead of the compact little New
England town; the introduction of large numbers of "indentured white
servants," and later negro slaves, led to the development of classes in
society instead of to the New England type of democracy; and the lack of a
strong religious motive for education naturally led to the adoption of the
customary English practices instead of to the development of colonial
schools. The tutor in the home, education in small private pay schools, or
education in the mother country were the prevailing methods adopted among
the well-to-do planters, while the poorer classes were left with only such
advantages as apprenticeship training or charity schools might provide.
Throughout the entire colonial period Virginia remained most like the
mother country in spirit and practice, and stands among the colonies as
the clearest example of the English attitude toward school support and
control. As in the mother country, education was considered to be no
business of the State. Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and
the Carolinas followed the English attitude, much after the fashion of
Virginia.

Practically all the Virginia colonial legislation relating to education
refers either to William and Mary College (founded in 1693), or to the
education of orphans and the children of the poor. Both these interests,
as we have previously seen, were typically English. All the seventeenth-
century legislation relating to education is based on the English Poor-Law
legislation, [14] previously described (p. 325), and included the
compulsory apprenticeship of the children of the poor, training in a
trade, the requirement that the public authorities must provide
opportunities for this type of education, and the use of both local and
colony funds for the purpose (R. 200 a), all, as the Statutes state,
"according to the aforesaid laudable custom in the Kingdom of England." It
was not until 1705 that Virginia reached the point, reached by
Massachusetts in 1642, of requiring that "the master of the [apprenticed]
orphan shall be obliged to teach him to read and write." In all the
Anglican colonies the apprenticing of the children of the poor (see R. 200
b for some interesting North Carolina records) was a characteristic
feature. During the entire colonial period the indifference of the mother
country to general education was steadily reflected in Virginia and in the
colonies which were essentially Anglican in religion, and followed the
English example.

TYPE PLANS REPRESENTED BY 1750. The seventeenth century thus witnessed the
transplanting of European ideas as to government, religion, and education
to the new American colonies, and by the eighteenth century we find three
clearly marked types of educational practice or conception as to
educational responsibility established on American soil.

The first was the strong Calvinistic conception of a religious State,
supporting a system of common vernacular schools, higher Latin schools,
and a college, for both religious and civic ends. This type dominated New
England, and is best represented by Massachusetts. From New England this
attitude was carried westward by the migrations of New England people, and
deeply influenced the educational development of all States to which the
New Englander went in any large numbers. This was the educational
contribution of Calvinism to America. [15] Out of it our state school
systems of to-day, by the separation of Church and State, have been
evolved.

The second was the parochial-school conception of the Dutch, Moravians,
Mennonites, German Lutherans, German Reformed Church, Quakers,
Presbyterians, Baptists, and Catholics. This type is best represented by
Protestant Pennsylvania and Catholic Maryland. It stood for church control
of all educational efforts, resented state interference, was dominated
only by church purposes, and in time came to be a serious obstacle in the
way of rational state school organization and control.

The third type, into which the second type tended to fuse, conceived of
public education, aside from collegiate education, as intended chiefly for
orphans and the children of the poor, and as a charity which the State was
under little or no obligation to assist in supporting. All children of the
upper and middle classes in society attended private or church schools, or
were taught by tutors in their homes, and for such instruction paid a
proper tuition fee. Paupers and orphans, in limited numbers and for a
limited time, might be provided with some form of useful education at the
expense of either Church or State. This type is best represented by
Anglican Virginia, which typified well the _laissez-faire_ policy which
dominated England from the time of the Protestant Reformation until the
latter half of the nineteenth century.

These three types of attitude toward the provision of education became
fixed American types, and each deeply influenced subsequent American
educational development, as we shall point out in a later chapter.

DOMINANCE OF THE RELIGIOUS MOTIVE. The seventeenth century was essentially
a period of the transplanting, almost unchanged in form, of the
characteristic European institutions, manners, religious attitudes, and
forms of government to American shores. Each sect or nationality on
arriving set up in the new land the characteristic forms of church and
school and social observances known in the old home-land. Dutch, Germans,
English, Scotch, Calvinists, Lutherans, Anglicans, Presbyterians--
reproduced in the American colonies the main type of schools existing at
the time of their migration in the mother land from which they came. They
were also dominated by the same deep religious purpose.

The dominance of this religious purpose in all instruction is well
illustrated by the great beginning-school book of the time, _The New
England Primer_. A digest of the contents of this, with a few pages
reproduced, is given in R. 202. This book, from which all children learned
to read, was used by Dissenters and Lutherans alike in the American
colonies. This book Ford well characterizes in the following words:

As one glances over what may truly be called "The Little Bible of New
England," and reads its stern lessons, the Puritan mood is caught with
absolute faithfulness. Here was no easy road to knowledge and salvation;
but with prose as bare of beauty as the whitewash of their churches, with
poetry as rough and stern as their storm-torn coast, with pictures as
crude and unfinished as their own glacial-smoothed boulders, between stiff
oak covers which symbolized the contents, the children were tutored,
until, from being unregenerate, and as Jonathan Edwards said, "young
vipers, and infinitely more hateful than vipers" to God, they attained
that happy state when, as expressed by Judge Sewell's child, they were
afraid that they "should goe to hell," and were "stirred up dreadfully to
seek God." God was made sterner and more cruel than any living judge, that
all might be brought to realize how slight a chance even the least erring
had of escaping eternal damnation.

One learned to read chiefly that one might be able to read the Catechism
and the Bible, and to know the will of the Heavenly Father. There was
scarcely any other purpose in the maintenance of elementary schools. In
the grammar schools and the colleges students were "instructed to consider
well the main end of life and studies." These institutions existed mainly
to insure a supply of learned ministers for service in Church and State.
Such studies as history, geography, science, music, drawing, secular
literature, and organized play were unknown. Children were constantly
surrounded, week days and Sundays, by the somber Calvinistic religious
atmosphere in New England, [16] and by the careful religious oversight of
the pastors and elders in the colonies where the parochial-school system
was the ruling plan for education. Schoolmasters were required to
"catechise their scholars in the principles of the Christian religion,"
and it was made "a chief part of the schoolmaster's religious care to
commend his scholars and his labors amongst them unto God by prayer
morning and evening, taking care that his scholars do reverently attend
during the same." Religious matter constituted the only reading matter,
outside the instruction in Latin in the grammar schools. The Catechism was
taught, and the Bible was read and expounded. Church attendance was
required, and grammar-school pupils were obliged to report each week on
the Sunday sermon. This insistence on the religious element was more
prominent in Calvinistic New England than in the colonies to the south,
but everywhere the religious purpose was dominant. The church parochial
and charity schools were essentially schools for instilling the church
practices and beliefs of the church maintaining them. This state of
affairs continued until well toward the beginning of the nineteenth
century.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Compare the conservative and radical groups in the English purification
movement with the conservative and radical groups, as typified by Erasmus
and Luther, at the time of the Reformation.

2. Show how, for each group, the schools established were merely homeland
foreign-type religious schools, with nothing distinctively American about
them.

3. Show why such copying of home-land types, even to the Latin grammar
school, was perfectly natural.

4. The provision of the Law of 1642 requiring instruction in "the capital
laws of the country" was new. How do you explain this addition to mother-
land practices?

5. Show why the Law of 1642 was Calvinistic rather than Anglican in its
origin.

6. Explain the meaning of the preamble to the Law of 1647.

7. Show how the Law of 1647 must go back for precedents to German, Dutch,
and Scotch sources.

8. Apply the six principles stated by Mr. Martin, as embodied in the
legislation of 1647, to modern state school practice, and show how we have
adopted each in our laws.

9. Show also that the Law of 1647, as well as modern state school laws, is
neither paternalistic nor socialistic in essential purpose.

10. Show that, though the mixture of religious sects in Pennsylvania made
colonial legislation difficult, still it would have been possible to have
enforced the Massachusetts Law of 1642, or the Pennsylvania laws of 1683
or 1693, in the colony. How do you explain the opposition and failure to
do so?

11. Show how the charity schools for the poor, and church missionary-
society schools, were the natural outcome of the English attitude toward
elementary education.

12. Which of the three type plans in the American colonies by 1750 most
influenced educational development in your State?

13. State the important contribution of Calvinism to our new-world life.

14. Explain the indifference of the Anglican Church to general education
during the whole of our colonial period.

15. Explain what is meant by "The Puritan Church applied to its servant,

CHAPTER XVI

THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY


NEW ATTITUDES AFTER THE ELEVENTH CENTURY. From the beginning of the
twelfth century onward, as we have already noted, there had been a slow
but gradual change in the character of human thinking, and a slow but
certain disintegration of the Mediaeval System, with its repressive
attitude toward all independent thinking. Many different influences and
movements had contributed to this change--the Moslem learning and
civilization in Spain, the recovery of the old legal and medical
knowledge, the revival of city life, the beginnings anew of commerce and
industry, the evolution of the universities, the rise of a small scholarly
class, the new consciousness of nationality, the evolution of the modern
languages, the beginnings of a small but important vernacular literature,
and the beginnings of travel and exploration following the Crusades--all
of which had tended to transform the mediaeval man and change his ways of
thinking. New objects of interest slowly came to the front, and new
standards of judgment gradually were applied. In consequence the mediaeval
man, with his feeling of personal insignificance and lack of self-
confidence, came to be replaced by a small but increasing number of men
who were conscious of their powers, possessed a new self-confidence, and
realized new possibilities of intellectual accomplishment.

The Revival of Learning, first in Italy and then elsewhere in western
Europe, was the natural consequence of this awakening of the modern
spirit, and in the careful work done by the humanistic scholars of the
Italian Renaissance in collecting, comparing, questioning, inferring,
criticizing, and editing the texts, and in reconstructing the ancient life
and history, we see the beginnings of the modern scientific spirit. It was
this same critical, questioning spirit which, when applied later to
geographical knowledge, led to the discovery of America and the
circumnavigation of the globe; which, when applied to matters of Christian
faith, brought on the Protestant Revolts; which, when applied to the
problems of the universe, revealed the many wonderful fields of modern
science; and which, when applied to government, led to a questioning of
the divine right of kings and the rise of constitutional government. The
awakening of scientific inquiry and the scientific spirit, and the attempt
of a few thinkers to apply the new method to education, to which we now
turn, may be regarded as only another phase of the awakening of the modern
inquisitive spirit which found expression earlier in the rise of the
universities, the recovery and reconstruction of the ancient learning, the
awakening of geographical discovery and exploration, and the questioning
of the doctrines and practices of the Mediaeval Church.

INSUFFICIENCY OF ANCIENT SCIENCE. From the point of view of scientific
inquiry, all ancient learning possessed certain marked fundamental
defects. The Greeks had--their time and age in world-civilization
considered--made many notable scientific observations and speculations,
and had prepared the way for future advances. Thales (636?-546? B.C.),
Xenophanes (628?-520? B.C.), Anaximenes (557-504 B.C.), Pythagoras (570-
500 B.C.), Heraclitus (c. 500 B.C.), Empedocles (460?-361? B.C.), and
Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) had all made interesting speculations as to the
nature of matter, [1] Aristotle finally settling the question by naming
the world-elements as earth, water, air, fire, and ether. Hippocrates
(460-367? B.C.), as we have seen (p. 197), had observed the sick and had
recorded and organized his observations in such a manner [2] as to form
the foundations upon which the science of medicine could be established.
The Greek physician, Galen (130-200 A.D.) added to these observations, and
their combined work formed the basis upon which modern medical science has
slowly been built up.

On the other hand, some of what each wrote was mere speculation and error,
[3] and modern physicians were compelled to begin all over and along new
lines before any real progress in medicine could be made. Aristotle had
done a notable work in organizing and codifying Greek scientific
knowledge, as the list of his many scientific treatises in use in Europe
by 1300 (R. 87) will show, but his writings were the result of a mixture
of keen observation and brilliant speculation, contained many
inaccuracies, and in time, due to the reverence accorded him as an
authority by the mediaeval scholars and the church authorities, proved
serious obstacles to real scientific progress.

At Alexandria the most notable Greek scientific work had been done. Euclid
(323-283 B.C.) in geometry; Aristarchus (third century B.C.), who
explained the motion of the earth; Eratosthenes (270-196 B.C.), who
measured the size of the earth; Archimedes (270?-212 B.C.), a pupil of
Euclid's, who applied science in many ways and laid the foundations of
dynamics; Hipparchus (160-125 B.C.), the father of astronomy, who studied
the heavens and catalogued the stars, were among the more famous Greeks
who studied and taught there in the days when Alexandria had succeeded
Athens as the intellectual capital of the Greek world. Some remarkable
advances also were made in the study of human anatomy and medicine by two
Greeks, Herophilus (335-280 B.C.) and Erasistratus (d. 280 B.C.), who
apparently did much dissecting.

But even at Alexandria the promise of Greek science was unfulfilled.
Despite many notable speculations and scientific advances, the hopeful
beginnings did not come to any large fruitage, and the great contribution
made by the Greeks to world civilization was less along scientific lines
than along the lines of literature and philosophy. Their great strength
lay in the direction of philosophic speculation, and this tendency to
speculate, rather than to observe and test and measure and record, was the
fundamental weakness of all Greek science. The Greeks never advanced in
scientific work to the invention and perfection of instruments for the
standardization of their observations. As a result they passed on to the
mediaeval world an extensive "book science" and not a little keen
observation, of which the works of Aristotle and the Alexandrian
mathematicians and astronomers form the most conspicuous examples, but
little scientific knowledge of which the modern world has been able to
make much use. The "book science" of the Greeks, and especially that of
Aristotle, was highly prized for centuries, but in time, due to the many
inaccuracies, had to be discarded and done anew by modern scholars.

The Romans, as we have seen (chapter III), were essentially a practical
people, good at getting the work of the world done, but not much given to
theoretical discussion or scientific speculation. They were organizers,
governors, engineers, executives, and literary workers rather than
scientists. They executed many important undertakings of a practical
character, such as the building of roads, bridges, aqueducts, and public
buildings; organized government and commerce on a large scale; and have
left us a literature and a legal system of importance, but they
contributed little to the realm of pure science. The three great names in
science in all their history are Strabo the geographer (63 B.C.-24 A.D.);
Pliny the Elder (23-79 A.D.), who did notable work as an observer in
natural history; and Galen (a Roman-Greek), in medicine. They, like the
Greeks, were pervaded by the same fear that their science might prove
useful, whereas they cultivated it largely as a mental exercise (R. 203).

THE CHRISTIAN REACTION AGAINST INQUIRY. The Christian attitude toward
inquiry was from the first inhospitable, and in time became exceedingly
intolerant. The tendency of the Western Church, it will be remembered (p.
94), was from the first to reject all Hellenic learning, and to depend
upon emotional faith and the enforcement of a moral life. By the close of
the third century the hostility to pagan schools and Hellenic learning had
become so pronounced that the _Apostolic Constitutions_ (R. 41) ordered
Christians to abstain from all heathen books, which could contain nothing
of value and only served "to subvert the faith of the unstable." In 401
A.D. the Council of Carthage forbade the clergy to read any heathen
author, and Greek learning now rapidly died out in the West. For a time it
was almost entirely lost. In consequence Greek science, then best
represented by Alexandrian learning, and which contained much that was of
great importance, was rejected along with other pagan learning. The, very
meager scientific knowledge that persisted into the Middle Ages in the
great mediaeval textbooks (p. 162), as we have seen in the study of the
Seven Liberal Arts (chapter VII), came to be regarded as useful only in
explaining passages of Scripture or in illustrating the ways of God toward
man. The one and only science worthy of study was Theology, to which all
other learning tended (see Figure 44, p. 154).

The history of Christianity throughout all the Dark Ages is a history of
the distrust of inquiry and reason, and the emphasis of blind emotional
faith. Mysticism, good and evil spirits, and the interpretation of natural
phenomena as manifestations of the Divine will from the first received
large emphasis. The worship of saints and relics, and the great
development of the sensuous and symbolic, changed the earlier religion
into a crude polytheism. During the long period of the Middle Ages the
miraculous flourished. The most extreme superstition pervaded all ranks of
society. Magic and prayers were employed to heal the sick, restore the
crippled, foretell the future, and punish the wicked. Sacred pools, the
royal touch, wonder-working images, and miracles through prayer stood in
the way of the development of medicine (R. 204). Disease was attributed to
satanic influence, and a regular schedule of prayers for cures was in use.
Sanitation was unknown. Plagues and pestilences were manifestations of
Divine wrath, and hysteria and insanity were possession by the devil to be
cast out by whipping and torture. One's future was determined by the
position of the heavenly bodies at the time of birth. Eclipses, meteors,
and comets were fearful portents of Divine displeasure:

  Eight things there be a Comet brings,
    When it on high doth horrid rage;
  Wind, Famine, Plague, and Death to Kings,
    War, Earthquakes, Floods, and Direful Change. [4]

The literature on magic was extensive. The most miraculous happenings were
recorded and believed. Trial by ordeal, following careful religious
formulae, was common before 1200, though prohibited shortly afterward by
papal decrees (1215, 1222). The insistence of the Church on "the willful,
devilish character of heresy," and the extension of heresy to cover almost
any form of honest doubt or independent inquiry, caused an intellectual
stagnation along lines of scientific investigation which was not relieved
for more than a thousand years. The many notable advances in physics,
chemistry, astronomy, and medicine made by Moslem scholars (chapter VIII)
were lost on Christian Europe, and had to be worked out again centuries
later by the scholars of the western world. Out of the astronomy of the
Arabs the Christians got only astrology; out of their chemistry they got
only alchemy. Both in time stood seriously in the way of real scientific
thinking and discovery.

GROWING TOLERANCE CHANGED BY THE PROTESTANT REVOLTS. After the rise of the
universities, the expansion of the minds of men which followed the
Crusades and the revival of trade and industry, the awakening which came
with the revival of the old learning and the rise of geographical
discovery, the church authorities assumed a broader and a more tolerant
attitude toward inquiry and reason than had been the case for hundreds of
years. It would have been surprising, with the large number of university-
trained men entering the service of the Church, had this not been the
case. By the middle of the fifteenth century it looked as though the
Renaissance spirit might extend into many new directions, and by 1500 the
world seemed on the eve of important progress in almost every line of
endeavor. As was pointed out earlier (p. 259), the Church was more
tolerant than it had been for centuries, and about the year 1500 was the
most stimulating time in the history of our civilization since the days of
Alexandria and ancient Rome.

In 1517 Luther nailed his theses to the church door in Wittenberg. The
Church took alarm and attempted to crush him, and soon the greatest
contest since the conflict between paganism and Christianity was on.
Within half a century all northern lands had been lost to the ancient
Church (see map, p. 296); the first successful challenge of its authority
during its long history.

The effect of these religious revolts on the attitude of the Church toward
intellectual liberty was natural and marked. The tolerance of inquiry
recently extended was withdrawn, and an era of steadily increasing
intolerance set in which was not broken for more than a century. In an
effort to stop the further spread of the heresy, the Church Council of
Trent (1545-63) adopted stringent regulations against heretical teachings
(p. 303), while the sword and torch and imprisonment were resorted to to
stamp out opposition and win back the revolting lands. A century of
merciless warfare ensued, and the hatreds engendered by the long and
bitter struggle over religious differences put both Catholic and
Protestant Europe in no tolerant frame of mind toward inquiry or new
ideas. The Inquisition, a sort of universal mediaeval grand jury for the
detection and punishment of heretics, was revived, and the Jesuits,
founded in 1534-40, were vigorous in defense of the Church and bitter in
their opposition to all forms of independent inquiry and Protestant
heresy.

It was into this post-Reformation atmosphere of suspicion and distrust and
hatred that the new critical, inquiring, questioning spirit of science, as
applied to the forces of the universe, was born. A century earlier the
first scientists might have obtained a respectful hearing, and might have
been permitted to press their claims; after the Protestant Revolts had
torn Christian Europe asunder this could hardly be. As a result the early
scientists found themselves in no enviable position. Their theories were
bitterly assailed as savoring of heresy; their methods and purposes were
alike suspected; and any challenge of an old long-accepted idea was likely
to bring a punishment that was swift and sure. From the middle of the
sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century was not a time when new
ideas were at a premium anywhere in western Europe. It was essentially a
period of reaction, and periods of reaction are not favorable to
intellectual progress. It was into this century of reaction that modern
scientific inquiry and reasoning, itself another form of expression of the
intellectual attitudes awakened by the work of the humanistic scholars of
the Italian Renaissance, made its first claim for a hearing.

THE BEGINNINGS OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC METHOD. One of the great problems
which has always deeply interested thinking men in all lands is the nature
and constitution of the material universe, and to this problem people in
all stages of civilization have worked out for themselves some kind of an
answer. It was one of the great speculations of the Greeks, and it was at
Alexandria, in the period of its decadence, that the Egyptian geographer
Ptolemy (138 A.D.) had offered an explanation which was accepted by
Christian Europe and which dominated all thinking on the subject during
the Middle Ages. He had concluded that the earth was located at the center
of the visible universe, immovable, and that the heavenly bodies moved
around the earth, in circular motion, fixed in crystalline spheres. [5]
This explanation accorded perfectly with Christian ideas as to creation,
as well as with Christian conceptions as to the position and place of man
and his relation to the heavens above and to a hell beneath. This theory
was obviously simple and satisfactory, and became sanctified with time. As
we see it now the wonder is that such an explanation could have been
accepted for so long. Only among an uninquisitive people could so
imperfect a theory have endured for over fourteen centuries.

[Illustration: FIG. 113. NICHOLAS KOPERNIK (Copernicus), (1473-1543)]

In 1543 a Bohemian church canon and physician by the name of Nicholas
Copernicus published his _De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium_, in which he
set forth the explanation of the universe which we now know. He piously
dedicated the work to Pope Paul III, and wisely refrained from publishing
it until the year of his death. [6] Anything so completely upsetting the
Christian conception as to the place and position of man in the universe
could hardly be expected to be accepted, particularly at the time of its
publication, without long and bitter opposition.

In the dedicatory letter (R. 205), Copernicus explains how, after feeling
that the Ptolemaic explanation was wrong, he came to arrive at the
conclusions he did. The steps he set forth form an excellent example of a
method of thinking now common, but then almost unknown. They were:

    1. Dissatisfaction with the old Ptolemaic explanation.

    2. A study of all known literature, to see if any better explanation
       had been offered.

    3. Careful thought on the subject, until his thinking took form in a
       definite theory.

    4. Long observation and testing out, to see if the observed facts
       would support his theory.

    5. The theory held to be correct, because it reduced all known facts
       to a systematic order and harmony.

This is as clear a case of inductive reasoning as was L. Valla's exposure
of the forgery of the so-called "Donation of Constantine," an example of
deductive reasoning. Both used a new method--the method of modern
scholarship. In both cases the results were revolutionary. As Petrarch
stands forth in history as the first modern classical scholar, so
Copernicus stands forth as the first modern scientific thinker. The
beginnings of all modern scientific investigation date from 1543. Of his
work a recent writer (E. C. J. Morton) has said:

    Copernicus cannot be said to have flooded with light the dark  places
    of nature--in the way that one stupendous mind subsequently did--
    but still, as we look back through the long vista of the history of
    science, the dim Titanic figure of the old monk seems to rear itself
    out of the dull flats around it, pierces with its head the mists that
    overshadow them, and catches the first gleam of the rising sun,...

      Like some iron peak, by the Creator
      Fired with the red glow of the rushing morn.

[Illustration: FIG. 114. TYCHO BRAHE (1546-1601)]

THE NEW METHOD OF INQUIRY APPLIED BY OTHERS. At first Copernicus' work
attracted but little attention. An Italian Dominican by the name of
Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), deeply impressed by the new theory, set forth
in Latin and Italian the far-reaching and majestic implications of such a
theory of creation, and was burned at the stake at Rome for his pains. A
Dane, Tycho Brahe, after twenty-one years of careful observation of the
heavens, during which time he collected "a magnificent series of
observations, far transcending in accuracy [7] and extent anything that
had been accomplished by his predecessors," showed Aristotle to be wrong
in many particulars. His observations of the comet of 1577 led him to
conclude that the theory of crystalline spheres was impossible, and that
the common view of the time as to their nature [8] was absurd. In 1609 a
German by the name of Johann Kepler (1571-1630), using the records of
observations which Tycho Brahe had accumulated and applying them to the
planet Mars, proved the truth of the Copernican theory and framed his
famous three laws for planetary motion.

[Illustration: FIG. 115. GALILEO GALILEI (1564-1642)]

Finally an Italian, Galileo Galilei, a professor at the University of
Pisa, developing a telescope that would magnify to eight diameters,
discovered Jupiter's satellites and Saturn's rings. The story of his
discovery of the satellites of Jupiter is another interesting illustration
of the careful scientific reasoning of these early workers (R. 206).
Galileo also made a number of discoveries in physics, through the use of
new scientific methods, which completely upset the teachings of the
Aristotelians, and made the most notable advances in mechanics since the
days of Archimedes. For his pronounced advocacy of the Copernican theory
he was called to Rome (1615) by the Cardinals of the Inquisition, the
Copernican theory was condemned as "absurd in philosophy" and as
"expressly contrary to Holy Scripture," and Galileo was compelled to
recant (1616) his error. [9] For daring later (1632) to assume that he
might, under a new Pope, defend the Copernican theory, even in an indirect
manner, he was again called before the inquisitorial body, compelled to
recant and abjure his errors (R. 207) to escape the stake, and was then
virtually made a prisoner of the Inquisition for the remainder of his
life. So strongly had the forces of medievalism reasserted themselves
after the Protestant Revolts!

[Illustration: FIG. 116. SIR ISAAC NEWTON (1642-1727)]

Finally the English scholar Newton (1642-1728), in his _Principia_ (1687),
settled permanently all discussions as to the Copernican theory by his
wonderful mathematical studies. He demonstrated mathematically the motions
of the planets and comets, proved Kepler's laws to be true, explained
gravitation and the tides, made clear the nature of light, and reduced
dynamics to a science. Of his work a recent writer, Karl Pearson, has
said:

The Newtonian laws of motion form the starting point of most modern
treatises on dynamics, and it seems to me that physical science, thus
started, resembles the mighty genius of an Arabian tale emerging amid
metaphysical exhalations from the bottle in which for long centuries it
had been corked down.

So far-reaching in its importance was the scientific work of Newton that
Pope's couplet seems exceedingly applicable:

  Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night;
  God said, "Let Newton be," and all was light.

THE NEW METHOD APPLIED IN OTHER FIELDS. The new method of study was soon
applied to other fields by scholars of the new type, here and there, and
always with fruitful results. The Englishman, William Gilbert (1540-1603)
published, in 1600, his _De Arte Magnetica_, and laid the foundations of
the modern study of electricity and magnetism. A German-Swiss by the name
of Hohenheim, but who Latinized his name to Paracelsus (1493-1541), and
who became a professor in the medical faculty at the University of Basle,
in 1526 broke with mediaeval traditions by being one of the first
university scholars to refuse to lecture in Latin. He ridiculed the
medical theories of Hippocrates (p. 197) and Galen (p. 198), and,
regarding the human body as a chemical compound, began to treat diseases
by the administration of chemicals. A Saxon by the name of Landmann, who
also Latinized his name to Agricola (1494-1555), applied chemistry to
mining and metallurgy, and a French potter named Bernard Palissy (c. 1500-
88) applied chemistry to pottery and the arts. To Paracelsus, Agricola,
and Palissy we are indebted for having laid, in the sixteenth century, the
foundations of the study of modern chemistry.

[Illustration: FIG. 117. WILLIAM HARVEY (1578-1657)]

A Belgian by the name of Vesalius (1514-64) was the first modern to
dissect the human body, and for so doing was sentenced by the Inquisition
to perform a penitential journey to Jerusalem. One of his disciples
discovered the valves in the veins and was the teacher of the Englishman,
William Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the blood and later
(1628) dared to publish the fact to the world. These men established the
modern studies of anatomy and physiology. Another early worker was a Swiss
by the name of Conrad Gessner (1516-65), who observed and wrote
extensively on plants and animals, and who stands as the first naturalist
of modern times.

The sixteenth century thus marks the rise of modern scientific inquiry,
and the beginnings of the study of modern science. The number of scholars
engaged in the study was still painfully small, and the religious
prejudice against which they worked was strong and powerful, but in the
work of these few men we have not only the beginnings of the study of
modern astronomy, physics, chemistry, metallurgy, medicine, anatomy,
physiology, and natural history, but also the beginnings of a group of
men, destined in time to increase greatly in number, who could see
straight, and who sought facts regardless of where they might lead and
what preconceived ideas they might upset. How deeply the future of
civilization is indebted to such men, men who braved social ostracism and
often the wrath of the Church as well, for the, to them, precious
privilege of seeing things as they are, we are not likely to over-
estimate. In time their work was destined to reach the schools, and to
materially modify the character of all education.

[Illustration: FIG. 118. FRANCIS BACON (1561-1626)]

HUMAN REASON IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE. To the English statesman and
philosopher, Francis Bacon, more than to any one else, are we indebted for
the proper formulation and statement of this new scientific method. Though
not a scientist himself, he has often been termed "the father of modern
science." Seeing clearly the importance of the new knowledge, he broke
entirely with the old scholastic deductive logic as expressed in the
_Organon_, of Aristotle, and formulated and expressed the methods of
inductive reasoning in his _Novum Organum_, published in 1620. In this he
showed the insufficiency of the method of argumentation; analyzed and
formulated the inductive method of reasoning, of which his study as to the
nature of heat [10] is a good example; and pointed out that knowledge is a
process, and not an end in itself; and indicated the immense and fruitful
field of science to which the method might be applied. By showing how to
learn from nature herself he turned the Renaissance energy into a new
direction, and made a revolutionary break with the disputations and
deductive logic of the Aristotelian scholastics which had for so long
dominated university instruction.

In formulating the new method he first pointed out the defects of the
learning of his time, which he classified under the head of "distempers,"
three in number, and as follows:

    1. _Fantastic learning_: Alchemy, magic, miracles, old-wives,
    tales, credulities, superstitions, pseudo-science, and impostures of
    all sorts inherited from an ignorant past, and now conserved as
    treasures of knowledge.

    2. _Contentious learning_: The endless disputations of the
    Scholastics about questions which had lost their significance,
    deductive in character, not based on any observation, not aimed
    primarily to arrive at truth, "fruitful of controversy, and barren of
    effect."

    3. _Delicate learning_: The new learning of the humanistic
    Renaissance, verbal and not real, stylish and polished but not
    socially important, and leading to nothing except a mastery of itself.

As an escape from these three types of distempers, which well
characterized the three great stages in human progress from the sixth to
the fifteenth centuries, Bacon offered the inductive method, by means of
which men would be able to distinguish true from false, learn to see
straight, create useful knowledge, and fill in the great gaps in the
learning of the time by actually working out new knowledge from the
unknown. The collecting, organizing, comparing, questioning, and inferring
spirit of the humanistic revival he now turned in a new direction by
organizing and formulating for the work a new _Organum_ to take the place
of the old _Organon_ of Aristotle. In Book 1 he sets forth some of the
difficulties (R. 208) with which those who try new experiments or work out
new methods of study have to contend from partisans of old ideas.

The _Novum Organum_ showed the means of escape from the errors of two
thousand years by means of a new method of thinking and work. Bacon did
not invent the new method--it had been used since man first began to
reason about phenomena, and was the method by means of which Wycliffe,
Luther, Magellan, Copernicus, Brahe, and Gilbert had worked--but he was
the first to formulate it clearly and to point out the vast field of new
and useful knowledge that might be opened up by applying human reason,
along inductive lines, to the investigation of the phenomena of nature.
His true service to science lay in the completeness of his analysis of the
inductive process, and his declaration that those who wish to arrive at
useful discoveries must travel by that road. As Macaulay well says, in his
essay on Bacon:

    He was not the maker of that road; he was not the discoverer of that
    road; he was not the person who first surveyed and mapped that road.
    But he was the person who first called the public attention to an
    inexhaustible mine of wealth which had been utterly neglected, and
    which was accessible by that road alone.

To stimulate men to the discovery of useful truth, to turn the energies of
mankind--even slowly--from assumption and disputation to patient
experimentation, [11.] and to give an impress to human thinking which it
has retained for centuries, is, as Macaulay well says, "the rare
prerogative of a few imperial spirits." Macaulay's excellent summary of
the importance of Bacon's work (R. 209) is well worth reading at this
point.

THE NEW METHOD IN THE HANDS OF SUBSEQUENT WORKERS. By the middle of the
seventeenth century many important advances had been made in many
different lines of scientific work. In the two centuries between 1450 and
1650, the foundations of modern mathematics and mechanics had been laid.
At the beginning of the period Arabic notation and the early books of
Euclid were about all that were taught; at its end the western world had
worked out decimals, symbolic algebra, much of plane and spherical
trigonometry, mechanics, logarithms (1614) and conic sections (1637), and
was soon to add the calculus (1667-87). Mercator had published the map of
the world (1569) which has ever since born his name, and the Gregorian
calendar had been introduced (1572). The barometer, thermometer, air-pump,
pendulum clock, and the telescope had come into use in the period. Alchemy
had passed over into modern chemistry; and the astrologer was finding less
and less to do as the astronomer took his place. The English Hippocrates,
Thomas Sydenham (1624-89), during this period laid the foundations of
modern medical study, and the microscope was applied to the study of
organic forms. Modern ideas as to light and optics and gases, and the
theory of gravitation, were about to be set forth. All these advances had
been made during the century following the epoch-making labors of
Copernicus, the first modern scientific man to make an impression on the
thinking of mankind.

Accompanying this new scientific work there arose, among a few men in each
of the western European countries, an interest in scientific studies such
as the world had not witnessed since the days of the Alexandrian Greek.
This interest found expression in the organization of scientific
societies, wholly outside the universities of the time, for the reporting
of methods and results, and for the mingling together in sympathetic
companionship of these seekers after new truth. The most important dates
connected with the rise of these societies are:

    1603. The Lyncean Society at Rome.
    1619. Jungius founded the Natural Science Association at Rostock.
    1645. The Royal Society of London began to meet; constituted in 1660;
          chartered in 1662.
    1657. The Academia del Cimento at Florence.
    1662. The Imperial Academy of Germany.
    1666. The Academy of Sciences in France.
    1675. The National Observatory at Greenwich established.

After 1650 the advance of science was rapid. The spirit of modern inquiry,
which in the sixteenth century had animated but a few minds, by the middle
of the seventeenth had extended to all the principal countries of Europe.
The striking results obtained during the seventeenth century revealed the
vast field waiting to be explored, and filled many independent modern-type
scholars with an enthusiasm for research in the new domain of science. By
the close of the eighteenth century the main outlines of most of the
modern sciences had been established.

LEADING THINKERS OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITIES. During the seventeenth century,
and largely during the eighteenth as well, the extreme conservatism of the
universities, their continued control by their theological faculties, and
their continued devotion to theological controversy and the teachings of
state orthodoxy rather than the advancement of knowledge, served to make
of them such inhospitable places for the new scientific method that
practically all the leading workers with it were found outside the
universities. This was less true of England than other lands, but was in
part true of English universities as well. As civil servants, court
attachés, pensioners of royalty, or as private citizens of means they
found, as independent scholars reporting to the recently formed scientific
societies, a freedom for investigation and a tolerance of ideas then
scarcely possible anywhere in the university world.

[Illustration: FIG. 120. RENÉ DESCARTES (1596-1650)]

Tycho Brahe and Kepler were pensioners of the Emperor at Prague. Lord
Bacon was a lawyer and political leader, and became a peer of England.
Descartes, the mathematician and founder of modern philosophy, to whom we
are indebted for conic sections; Napier, inventor of logarithms; and Ray
and Willoughby, who did the first important work in botany and zoology in
England, were all independent scholars. The air-pump was invented by the
Burgomaster of Madgeburg. Huygens, the astronomer and inventor of the
clock was a pensioner of the King of France. Cassini, who explained the
motion of Jupiter's satellites, was Astronomer Royal at Paris. Halley, who
demonstrated the motions of the moon and who first predicted the return of
a comet, held a similar position at Greenwich. Van Helmont and Boyle, who
together laid the foundations of our chemical knowledge, were both men of
noble lineage who preferred the study of the new sciences to a life of
ease at court. Harvey was a physician and demonstrator of anatomy in
London. Sydenham, the English Hippocrates, was a pensioner of Cromwell and
a physician in Westminster. The German mathematical scholar, Leibnitz, who
jointly with Newton discovered the calculus, scorned a university
professorship and remained an attaché of a German court. Newton, though
for a time a professor at Cambridge, during most of his mature life held
the royal office of Warden of the Mint. These are a few notable
illustrations of scientific scholars of the first rank who remained
outside the universities to obtain advantages and freedom not then to be
found within their walls. Much these same conditions continued throughout
most of the eighteenth century, during which many remarkable advances in
all lines of pure science were made. By the close of this century the
universities had been sufficiently modernized that scientific workers
began to find in them an atmosphere conducive to scientific teaching and
research; during the nineteenth century they became the homes of
scientific progress and instruction; to-day they are deeply interested in
the promotion of scientific research.

CHAPTER XVII

THE NEW SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS


THE RISE OF REALISM IN EDUCATION. As will be remembered from our study of
the educational results of the Revival of Learning (chapter XI), the new
schools established in the reaction against medievalism, to teach pure
Latin and Greek, in time became formal and lifeless (p. 283), and their
aim came to be almost entirely that of imparting a mastery of the
Ciceronian style, both in writing and in speech. This idea, first clearly
inaugurated by Sturm at Strassburg (R. 137), had now become fixed, and in
its extreme is illustrated by the teachings of the Jesuit Campion at
Prague (R. 146). As a reaction against this extreme position of the
humanistic scholars there arose, during the sixteenth century, and as a
further expression of the new critical spirit awakened by the Revival of
Learning, a demand for a type of education which would make truth rather
than beauty, and the realities of the life of the time rather than the
beauties of a life of Roman days, the aim and purpose of education. This
new spirit became known as Realism, was contemporaneous with the rise of
scientific inquiry, and was an expression of a similar dissatisfaction
with the learning of the time. As applied to education this new spirit may
be said to have manifested itself in three different stages, as follows:

    1. Humanistic realism.
    2. Social realism.
    3. Sense realism.

We will explain each of these, briefly, in order.


1. HUMANISTIC REALISM

A NEW AIM IN INSTRUCTION. Humanistic realism represents the beginning of
the reaction against form and style and in favor of ideas and content. The
humanistic realists were in agreement with the classical humanists that
the old classical literatures and the Bible contained all that was
important in the education of youth. The ancient literatures, they held,
presented "not only the widest product of human intelligence, but
practically all that was worthy of man's attention." The two groups
differed, however, in that the classical humanists conceived the aim of
education to be the mastery of the vocabulary and style of Cicero, and the
production of a new race of Roman youths for a revived Latin scholarly
world, while the new humanistic realists wanted to use the old literatures
as a means to a new end--that of teaching knowledge that would be useful
in the world in which they lived. Monroe has so well expressed the
humanistic-realist attitude that a passage from his History is worth
quoting here. He says:

    Not only did ancient philosophy contain the true philosophy of this
    life, but languages were the key to the real understanding of the
    Christian religion. Not only did mastery of these languages give power
    of speech, and hence influence over one's fellows; but, if military
    science was to be studied, it could in no place be better searched for
    than in Caesar and in Xenophon; was agriculture to be practiced, no
    better guide was to be found than Virgil or Columella; was
    architecture to be mastered, no better way existed than through
    Vitruvius; was geography to be considered, it must be through Mela or
    Solinus; was medicine to be understood, no better means than Celsus
    existed; was natural history to be appreciated, there was no more
    adequate source of information than Pliny and Seneca. Aristotle
    furnished the basis of all the sciences, Plato of all philosophy,
    Cicero of all institutional life, and the Church Fathers and the
    Scriptures of all religion.

EXPONENTS OF HUMANISTIC REALISM. The Dutch international scholar Erasmus
(1467?-1536) (p. 274), the Frenchman Rabelais (1483-1553), and the English
poet Milton (1608-74) stand as the clearest representatives of this new
humanistic realism.

Erasmus had clearly distinguished between the education of words and the
education of things, had pointed out the ease with which real truth is
learned and retained, and had urged the study of the content rather than
the form of the ancient authors. In his _System of Studies_ he said:

    From these very authors (Latin and Greek), whom we read for the sake
    of improving our language, incidentally, in no small degree is a
    knowledge of things gathered.

In his _Ciceronian_ he had ridiculed those who mistook the form for the
spirit of the ancients.

The French non-conforming monk, curé, physician, and university scholar,
François Rabelais, in his satirical _Life of Gargantua_ (1535) and _The
Heroic Deeds of Pantagruel_ (1533) had set forth, even more clearly, the
idea of obtaining from a study of the ancient authors (R. 210) knowledge
that would be useful. Writing largely in the character of a clown and a
fool, because such was a safer method, he protested against the formal,
shallow, and insincere life of his age. He made as vigorous a protest
against medievalism and formalism as he dared, for he lived in a time when
new ideas were dangerous commodities for one to carry about or to try to
express. He ridiculed the old scholastic learning, set forth the idea of
using the old classics for realistic as well as humanistic ends, and also
advocated physical, moral, social, and religious education in the spirit
of the best writers and teachers of the Italian Renaissance. His book was
extensively read and had some influence in shaping thinking, though
Rabelais's importance in the history of education lies rather in his
influence on later educational thinkers than on the life of his time.

[Illustration: FIG. 121. FRANÇOIS RABELAIS (1483-1553)]

Perhaps the clearest example of humanistic realism is found in the
writings of the English poet and humanitarian, John Milton. His _Tractate
on Education_ (1644) was extensively read, and was influential in shaping
educational practice in the non-conformist secondary academies which arose
a little later in England. Still later his ideas indirectly somewhat
influenced American development.

Milton first gives us an excellent statement of the new religious-civic
aim of post-Reformation education (R. 211), and then points out the
defects of the existing education, whereby boys "spend seven or eight
years merely in scraping together so much miserable Latine and Greek, as
might be learnt otherwise easily and delightfully in one year." He then
presents his plan for "a compleat and generous Education" for "noble and
gentle youths," and tells "how all this may be done between twelve and one
and twenty, less time than is now bestowed in pure trifling at Grammar and
Sophistry." The course of study he outlines (R. 212) is enormous. The
first year, that is beginning at twelve, the boy is to learn Latin
grammar, arithmetic, and geometry, and to read simple Latin and Greek.
During the next three or four years the pupil is to master Greek, and to
study agriculture, geography, natural philosophy, physiology, mathematics,
fortification, engineering, architecture, and natural history, all by
reading the chief writings of the ancients, in prose and poetry, on these
subjects. During the remaining years to twenty-one the pupil, similarly,
is to obtain ethical instruction from the Greeks and the Bible; learn
Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Saxon law; learn Italian and Hebrew; and study
economics, politics, history, logic, rhetoric, and poetry by reading
selected ancient authors. What Rabelais suggested in jest for his giant,
Milton adopted as a program for the school. In addition, in thoroughly
characteristic modern English fashion, he makes careful provision for
daily exercise and play. Aside, though, from its impossibility of
accomplishment except by a superior few, Milton's plan is thoroughly
representative of the new humanistic-realistic point of view-that is, that
education should impart useful information, though the information as
Milton conceived it was to be drawn almost entirely from the books of the
ancients.

[Illustration: FIG. 122. JOHN MILTON (1608-74)]

EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF HUMANISTIC REALISM. The importance of humanistic
realism in the history of education lies largely in that it was the first
of a series of reactions that led later to sense-realism--that is, to the
study of science and the application of scientific method in the schools.

In England it possesses still larger importance. Milton had called his
institution an "Academy." [1] After the restoration of the Stuarts
(Charles II, 1660), some two thousand non-conforming clergymen were
"dispossessed" by the Act of Conformity (1662; R. 166), and soon after
this the children of Non-Conformists were excluded from the grammar
schools and universities. Many of these clergymen now turned to teaching
as a means of earning a livelihood and serving their people, and the ideas
of the non-conformist Milton were influential in turning the schools thus
established even further toward the study of useful subjects. Many of the
new schools offered instruction in the modern languages, logic, rhetoric,
ethics, geography, astronomy, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, surveying,
navigation, history, oratory, economics, and natural and moral philosophy,
as well as the old classical subjects. All teaching, too, was done in
English, and the study of English language and literature was emphasized.
This made these non-conformist academies in many respects superior to the
older Latin grammar schools. After the enactment of the Toleration Act, in
1689, these schools were allowed to incorporate and were gradually
absorbed into the existing Latin grammar-school system of England, but
unfortunately without producing much change in the character of these
older institutions.

The idea of offering instruction in these new studies was in time carried
to America, where better results were obtained. At first a few of the
subjects, such as the mathematical studies, surveying, navigation, and
English, were introduced into the existing Latin grammar or other schools
of secondary grade. Especially was this true in the colonies south of New
England. After 1751, and especially after about 1780, distinct Academies
arose in the United States (chapter XVIII), whose purpose was to offer
instruction in all these new subjects of study. From these our modern high
schools have been derived.


II. SOCIAL REALISM

[Illustration: FIG. 123. MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE (1533-92)]

MONTAIGNE AND LOCKE. Social realism represents a still further reaction
away from the humanistic schools. It was the natural reaction of practical
men of the new world against a type of education that tended to perpetuate
the pedantry of an earlier age, by devoting its energies to the production
of the scholar and professional man to the neglect of the man of affairs.
The social realists were small in number, but powerful because of their
important social connections and wealth, and they were very determined to
have an education suited to their needs, even if they had to create it
themselves (R. 213). The French nobleman, scholar, author, and civic
officer, M. de Montaigne (1533-92), and the English philosopher, John
Locke (1632-1704), were the clearest exponents of this new point of view,
though it found expression in the writings of many others. Each declared
for a practical, useful type of education for the young boy who was to
live the life of a gentleman in the world of affairs.

Neither had any sympathy with the colleges and grammar schools of the time
(R. 214), and both rejected the school for the private tutor. This tutor
must be selected with great care, and first of all must be a well-bred
gentleman--a man, as Montaigne says, "who has rather a well-made than a
well-filled head" (R. 215). Locke cautions that "one fit to educate and
form the Mind of a young Gentleman is not every where to be found," and of
the common type of teacher he asks, "When such an one has empty'd out into
his Pupil all the Latin and Logick he has brought from the University,
will that Furniture make him a fine Gentleman?" (R. 216).

Both condemn the school training of their time, and both urge that the
tutor train the judgment and the understanding rather than the memory. To
impart good manners rather than mere information, and to train for life in
the world rather than for the life of a scholar, seem to both of
fundamental importance in the education of a boy. "The great world," says
Montaigne, "is the mirror wherein we are to behold ourselves. In short, I
would have this to be the book my young gentleman should study with the
most attention." "Latin and Learning," says Locke, "make all the Noise;
and the main Stress is laid upon Proficiency in Things a great Part
whereof belong not to a Gentleman's Calling; which is to have the
Knowledge of a Man of Business, a Carriage suitable to his Rank, and to be
eminent and useful to his Country, according to his Station" (R. 216).
Both emphasized the importance of travel abroad as an important factor in
the education of a gentleman.

THEIR PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. Both Montaigne and Locke were
concerned alone with the education of the sons of gentlemen, individuals
now coming rapidly into prominence to dispute place in the world of
affairs with the higher nobility on the one hand and the clergy on the
other. With the education of any other class Montaigne never concerned
himself. As for Locke, he was later appointed a King's Commissioner, with
certain oversight of the poor, and for the education of the children of
such he drew up a careful report which, in true English fashion, provided
for their training in workhouses and their apprenticeship to a trade (R.
217). He wrote nothing with regard to the education of the children of
middle-class workers and tradesmen. Both authors also deal entirely with
the work of a tutor, and not with the work of a teacher in a school.
Neither deals specifically with elementary education, but rather with
what, in Europe, would be called the secondary-school period in the
education of a boy. Locke was extensively read by the gentry of England,
as expressive of the best current practice of their class, and his ideas
as to education were also of some influence in shaping the instruction of
the non-conformist teachers in the academies there. His place in the
history of education is also of some importance, as we shall point out
later, for the disciplinary theory of education which he set forth. Still
more, Locke later exerted a deep influence on the writings of Rousseau
(chapter XXI), and hence helped materially to shape modern educational
theory.

[Illustration: FIG. 124. JOHN LOCKE (1631-1704)]

THE NEW SCHOOLS FOR THE SONS OF THE GENTRY. Both Montaigne and Locke, in
their emphasis on the importance of a practical education for the social
and political demands of a gentleman concerned with the affairs of the
modern world, represent a still further reaction against the humanistic
schools of the time than did the humanistic realists whom we have just
considered. Still more, both are expressive of the attitude of the
nobility and gentry of the time, who had almost deserted the schools as
pedantic institutions of little value. France was then the great country
of Europe, and French language, French political ideas, French manners,
and French tutors found their way into all neighboring lands. Well, these
cajoleries were not often successful, yet often enough to keep the
sporting instinct alive and active, and a great deal oftener than F--'s
equally disreputable endeavours: it being a tradition with the staff that
F--' had sworn by all his gods to get in an article which would
force the printer to flee the country.

I need scarcely say that the tradition was
groundless, but we worked it shamelessly.

In this way on January 9th, 1897 (a year in which the Westminster Aquarium
was yet standing), and shortly after the issue of the New Year's Honours'
List, the following article appeared in _The Speaker_. The reader will
find it quite harmless until he comes to the sequel. It was entitled--

NOOKS OF OLD LONDON.

    I.--THE WESTMINSTER SCUTORIUM.
    
    Let me begin by assuring the reader that the Westminster Scutorium has
    absolutely no connection with the famous Aquarium across the road. I
    suppose that every Londoner has heard, at least, of the Aquarium,
but I doubt if one in a hundred has heard of the little Scutorium
which stands removed from it by a stone's throw, or less; and I am
certain that not one in a thousand has ever stooped his head to
enter by its shy, squat, fifteenth-century doorway.

    It is a fact that the very policeman at the entrance to Dean's
    Yard did not know its name, and the curator assures me that the
    Post Office has made frequent mistakes in delivering his letters.
    So my warning is not quite impertinent.
    
    But a reader of antiquarian tastes, who cares as little as I do for
hypnotisers and fasting men, and does not mind a trifle of dust,
so it be venerable, will not regret an hour spent in looking over
the Scutorium, or a chat with Mr.

Melville Robertson, its curator, or Clerk of the Ribands (_Stemmata_)--to
give him his official title.
Mr. Robertson ranks, indeed, with the four pursuivants of Heralds' College,
from which the Scutorium was originally an offshoot.
He takes an innocent delight in displaying his treasures and admitting you
to the stores of his unique information; and I am sure would welcome more
visitors.

Students of Constitutional History will remember that strange custom,
half Roman, half Medieval, in accordance with which a baron or knight,
on creation or accession to his title and dignities, deposited in the
king's keeping a waxen effigy, or mask, of himself together with a
copy of his coat of arms. And it has been argued-- plausibly enough
when we consider the ancestral masks of the old Roman families, the
respect paid to them by the household, and the important part they
played on festival days, at funerals, &c.

--that this offering was a formal recognition of the _patria potestas_
of the monarch as father of his people.

Few are aware, however, that the custom has never been discontinued, and
that the cupboards of Westminster contain a waxen memorial of almost every
man whom the king has delighted to honour, from the Conquest down to the
very latest knight gazetted.

    The labour of modelling and painting these effigies was discontinued
    as long ago as 1586; and the masks are no longer likenesses, but oval
    plates of copper, each bearing its name on a label. Mr. Robertson
    informed me that Charles I. made a brief attempt to revive the old
    practice.

    All the Stuarts, indeed, set store on the Scutorium and its
    functions; and I read in an historical pamphlet, by Mr. J. Saxby Hine,
    the late curator, that large apartments were allocated to the office
    in Inigo Jones's first designs for Whitehall.

But its rosy prospects faded with the accession of William of Orange.
Two years later the custody of the shields (from which it obtained its
name) was relegated to the Heralds' College; and the Scutorium has now to
be content with the care of its masks and the performance of some not
unimportant duties presently to be recounted.

A reference from the Heralds' College sent me in quest of Mr.
Melville Robertson.

But even in Dean's Yard I found it no easy matter to run him to earth. The
policeman (as I have said) could give me no help. At length, well within
the fourth doorway on the east side, after passing the railings, I spied
a modest brass plate with the inscription _Clerk of the Ribands. Hours 11
to 3_.
The outside of the building has a quite modern look, but the architect
has spared the portal, and the three steps which lead down to the
flagged entrance hall seem to mark a century apiece.

    I call it an entrance hall, but it is rather a small adytum, spanned
       by a pointed arch carrying the legend _Stemmata Quid Faciunt_.

    The modern exterior is, in fact, but a shell.

    All within dates from Henry VI.; and Mr. Robertson (but this
       is only a theory) would explain the sunken level of the ground-floor
rooms by the action of earthworms, which have gradually lifted the
surface of Dean's Yard outside.

    He contends the original level to be that of his office, which lies
       on the right of the adytum.

    A door on the left admits to two rooms occupied by the _nomenclator_,
       Mr.

    Pender, and two assistant clerks, who comprise the staff. Straight in
       front, a staircase leads to the upper-apartments.

    Mr. Robertson was writing when the clerk ushered me in, but
       at once professed himself at my service.

    He is a gentleman of sixty, or thereabouts, with white hair, a
       complexion of a country squire, and very genial manners.

    For some minutes we discussed the difficulty which had brought me
       to him (a small point in county history), and then he anticipated
my request for permission to inspect his masks.

   "Would you like to see them? They are really very curious, and I
       often wonder that the public should evince so small an interest."

   "You get very few visitors?"
       "Seldom more than two a day; a few more when the Honours' Lists
appear.

   I thought at first that your visit might be in connection with the new
       List, but reflected that it was too early.

   In a day or two we shall be comparatively busy."
    "The Scutorium is concerned then with the Honours' Lists?"
    "A little," replied Mr.

Robertson, smiling. "That is to say, we make them." Then, observing my
evident perplexity, he laughed.
"Well, perhaps that is too strong an expression. I should have said, rather,
that we fill up the blanks."
"I had always understood that the Prime Minister drew up the Lists
before submitting them to Her Majesty."

"So he does--with our help. Oh, there is no secrecy about it!" said
Mr. Robertson, in a tone almost rallying. "The public is free of all
information, only it will not inquire. A little curiosity on its part
would even save much unfortunate misunderstanding."
"In what way?"
"Well, the public reads of rewards (with which, by the way, I have nothing
to do) conferred on really eminent men--Lord Roberts, for instance,
or Sir Henry Irving, or Sir Joseph Lister.

It then goes down the List and, finding a number of names of which it
has never heard, complains that Her Majesty's favour has been bestowed
on nonentities; whereas this is really the merit of the List, that they
_are_ nonentities."
"I don't understand."
"Well, then, _they don't exist_."
"But surely--"
"My dear sir," said Mr. Robertson, still smiling, and handing me his
copy of _The Times_, "cast your eye down that column; take the names
of the new knights--'Blain, Clarke, Edridge, Farrant, Laing, Laird,
Wardle'--what strikes you as remarkable about them?"

    "Why, that I have never heard of any of them."
      "Naturally, for there are no such people. I made them up; and a
          good average lot they are, though perhaps the preponderance
          of
      monosyllables is a little too obvious."

    "But see here. I read that 'Mr. Thomas Wardle is a silk merchant of
       Staffordshire.'"

"But I assure you that I took him out of _Pickwick_."
"Yes, but here is 'William Laird,' for instance. I hear that already
two actual William Lairds--one of Birkenhead, the other of Glasgow--
are convinced that the honour belongs to them."

"No doubt they will be round in a day or two. The Heralds' College will
refer them to me--not simultaneously, if I may trust Sir Albert Woods's
tact--and I shall tell them that it belongs to neither, but to another
William Laird altogether.

    But, if you doubt, take the Indian promotions.

    Lord Salisbury sometimes adds a name or two after I send in the
List, and--well, you know his lordship is not fond of the dark races
and has a somewhat caustic humour.

    Look at the new C.I.E.'

    s: 'Rai Bahadur Pandit Bhag Rum.' Does it occur to you that a person
       of that name really exists?

    'Khan Bahadur Naoraji ('Naoraji,' mark you) Pestonji Vakil'--it's the
       language of extravaganza!

    The Marquis goes too far: it spoils all verisimilitude."

    Mr. Robertson grew quite ruffled.

    

    "Then you pride yourself on verisimilitude?" I suggested.

"As I think you may guess; and we spare no pains to attain it,
whether in the names or In the descriptions supplied to the
newspapers.

'William Arbuthnot Blain, Esq.'--you have heard of Balzac's scouring Paris
for a name for one of his characters. I assure you I scoured England
for William Arbuthnot Blain--'identified with the movement for improving
the dwellings of the labouring classes'--or is that Richard Farrant, Esq.?
In any case, what more likely, on the face of it? 'Frederick Wills,
Esq., of the well-known tobacco firm of Bristol'--the public swallows
that readily: and yet it never buys a packet of their Westward Ho! Mixture
(which I smoke myself) without reading that the Wills's of Bristol are
W. D. and H. O.--no Frederick at all."
"But," I urged, "the purpose of this--"
"I should have thought it obvious; but let me give you the history of it.
The practice began with William III. He was justly scornful of the lax
distribution of honours which had marked all the Stuart reigns.

You will hardly believe it, but before 1688 knighthoods, and even peerages,
went as often as not to men who qualified by an opportune loan to the
Exchequer, or even by presiding at a public feast. (I say nothing of
baronetcies, for their history is notorious.) At first William was for
making a clean sweep of the Honours' List, or limiting it to two or three
well-approved recipients. But it was argued that this seeming niggardliness
might injure His Majesty's popularity, never quite secure. The Scutorium
found a way out of the dilemma. Sir Crofton Byng, the then Clerk of the
Ribands, proposed the scheme, which has worked ever since.
I may tell you that the undue _largesse_ of honours finds in the very highest
quarters as little favour as ever it did. Of course, there are some whose
services to science, literature, and art cannot be ignored--the
late Lord Leighton, for instance, or Sir George Newnes, or Sir
Joseph Lister again; and these are honoured, while the public
acclaims.

But the rest are represented only in my collection of masks--and an interesting
one it is. Let me lead the way."
But I have left myself no space for describing the treasures of the
Scutorium. The two upper stories are undoubtedly the least interesting,
since they contain the modern, unpainted masks.
Each mask has its place, its label, and on the shelf below it, protected
by a slip of glass, a description of the imaginary recipient of the royal
favour. One has only to look along the crowded shelves to be convinced
that Mr. Melville Robertson's office is no sinecure. The first floor
is devoted to a small working library and a museum (the latter undergoing
rearrangement at the time of my visit). But the cellars!--or (as I
should say) the crypt!
In Beaumont's words--
"Here's a world of pomp and state Buried in dust, once dead by fate!"
Here in their native colours, by the light of Mr. Robertson's duplex lantern,
stare the faces of the illustrious dead, from Rinaldus FitzTurold, knighted
on Senlac field, to stout old Crosby Martin, sea-rover, who received
the accolade (we'll hope he deserved it) from the Virgin Queen in 1586. A
few even are adorned with side-locks, which Mr. Pender, the _nomenclator_,
keeps scrupulously dusted.
In almost every case the wax has withstood the tooth of time far better
than one could have expected. Mr. Robertson believes that the pigments
chosen must have had some preservative virtue.

If so, the secret has been lost. But Mr. Pender has touched over some
of the worst decayed with a mixture of copal and pure alcohol, by
which he hopes at least to arrest the mischief; and certainly the masks
in the Scutorium compare very favourably with the waxen effigies of our
royalties preserved in the Abbey, close by. Mr. Robertson has a theory
that these, too, should by rights belong to his museum: but that is another
story, and a long one. Suffice it to say that I took my leave with the
feelings of one who has spent a profitable afternoon: and for further
information concerning this most interesting nook of old London I can
only refer the reader to the pamphlet already alluded to, _The Westminster
Scutorium: Its History and Present Uses_. By J. Saxby Hine, C.B., F.S.A.
Theobald & Son, Skewers Alley, Chancery Lane, E.C.

This article appeared to my beloved editor innocent enough to pass, and to
me (as doubtless to the reader) harmless enough in all conscience.
Now listen to the sequel.

Long afterwards an acquaintance of mine--a barrister with antiquarian
tastes--was dining with me in my Cornish home, and the talk after dinner
fell upon the weekly papers and reviews. On _The Speaker_ he touched
with a reticence which I set down at first to dislike for his politics.

By and by, however, he let slip the word "untrustworthy."
"Holding your view of its opinions," I suggested, "you might fairly
say 'misleading.'

'Untrustworthy' is surely too strong a word."
"I am not talking," said he, "of its opinions, but of its mis-statements
of fact. Some time ago it printed an article on a place which it called
'The Westminster Scutorium,' and described in detail. I happened to
pick the paper up at my club and read the article. It contained a heap of
historical information on the forms and ceremonies which accompany the
granting of titles, and was apparently the work of a specialist.
Being interested (as you know) in these matters, and having an hour to
spare, I took a hansom down to Westminster. At the entrance of Dean's
Yard I found a policeman, and inquired the way to the Scutorium. He eyed
me for a moment, then he said, 'Well, I thought I'd seen the last of
'em.
You're the first to-day, so far; and yesterday there was only five.
But Monday--_and_ Tuesday--_and_ Wednesday! There must have been thirty
came as late as Wednesday; though by that time I'd found out what was the
matter. All Monday they kept me hunting round and round the yard,
following like a pack. Very respectable-looking old gentlemen, too,
the whole of 'em, else I should have guessed they were pulling my leg.
Most of 'em had copies of a paper, _The Speaker_, and read out bits from
it, and insisted on my searching in this direction and that . . . and
me being new to this beat, and seeing it all in print! We called in the
postman to help.

By and by they began to compare notes, and found they'd
been kidded, and some of 'em used language. . . . I really think, sir,
you must be the last of 'em.'"

  MAY.
  
  
  I was travelling some weeks ago by a railway line alongside of which
ran a quickset hedge.

It climbed to the summit of cuttings, plunged to the base of embankments,
looped itself around stations, flickered on the skyline above us,
raced us along the levels, dipped into pools, shot up again on their farther
banks, chivvied us into tunnels, ran round and waited for us as we emerged.
Its importunity drove me to the other side of the carriage, only to find
another quickset hedge behaving similarly.
Now I can understand that a railway company has excellent reasons for
planting quickset hedges alongside its permanent way. But their unspeakable
monotony set me thinking. Why do we neglect the real parks of England?--parks
enormous in extent, and yet uncultivated, save here and there and in the
most timid fashion. And how better could our millionaires use their wealth
(since they are always confiding to us their difficulties in getting rid
of it) than by seeking out these gardens and endowing them, and so,
without pauperising anyone, build for themselves monuments not only
delightful, but perpetual?--for, as Victor Hugo said, the flowers
last always. So, you may say, do books. I doubt it; and experts, who
have discussed with me the modern products of the paper trade, share my
gloomy views. Anyhow, the free public library has been sufficiently
exploited, if not worked out. So, you may say again, have free public
gardens and parks been worked out. I think not. Admit that a
fair percentage of the public avails itself of these libraries and
parks; still the mass does not, and they were intended for the mass.

Their attractiveness does not spread and go on spreading. The stream of
public appreciation which pours through them is not fathomless; beyond a
certain point it does not deepen, or deepens with heart-breaking slowness;
and candid librarians and curators can sound its shallows accurately
enough. What we want is not a garden into which folk will find their
way if they have nothing better to do and can spare the time with an
effort.
Or, to be accurate, we do want such gardens for deliberate enjoyment; but
what we want more is to catch our busy man and build a garden about him
in the brief leisure which, without seeking it, he is forced to
take.

Where are these gardens? Why, beside and along our railway lines.
These are the great public parks of England; and through them travels
daily a vast population held in enforced idleness, seeking distraction
in its morning paper. Have you ever observed how a whole carriageful of
travellers on the Great Western line will drop their papers to
gaze out on Messrs.

Sutton's trial-beds just outside Reading? A garish appeal, no doubt: a few
raying spokes of colour, and the vision has gone. And I forestall the
question, "Is that the sort of thing you wish to see extended?--a bed of
yellow tulips, for instance, or of scarlet lobelias, or of bright-blue
larkspurs, all the way from London to Liverpool?" I suggest nothing
of the sort. Our railway lines in England, when they follow the
valleys--as railway lines must in hilly districts--are extraordinarily
beautiful. The eye, for example, could desire nothing better, in swift
flight, than the views along the Wye Valley or in the Derbyshire Peak
country, and even the rich levels of Somerset have a beauty of their own
(above all in May and June, when yellow with sheets of buttercups) which
artificial planting would spoil. But--cant about Nature apart--every line
has its dreary cuttings and embankments, all of which might be made
beautiful at no great cost. I need not labour this: here and there by a
casual bunch of rhododendrons or of gorse, or by a sheet of primroses
or wild hyacinths in springtime, the thing is proved, and has been
proved again and again to me by the comments of fellow-passengers.

Now I am honestly enamoured of this dream of mine, and must pause
to dwell on some of its beauties.

    In the first place, we could start to realise it in the most
    modest fashion and test the appreciation of the public as we go
    along. Our flowers would be mainly wild flowers, and our trees, for
    the most part, native British plants, costing, say, from thirty
shillings to three pounds the hundred.

    A few roods would do to begin with, if the spot were well chosen;
    indeed, it would be wiser in every way to begin modestly, for though
    England possesses several great artists in landscape gardening,
    their art has never to my knowledge been seriously applied to
railway gardening, and the speed of the spectators introduces a new
and highly-amusing condition, and one so singular and so important
as to make this almost a separate art.

    At any rate, our gardeners would have to learn as they go, and if
    any man can be called enviable it is an artist learning to express
    art's eternal principles in a new medium, under new conditions.
    
    Even if we miss our millionaire, we need not despond over ways
    and means.
    The beauty-spots of Great Britain are engaged just now in a fierce
    rivalry of advertisement. Why should not this rivalry be pressed
    into the service of beautifying the railway lines along which the
tourist must travel to reach them?

    Why should we neglect the porches (so to speak) of our
    temples? Would not the tourist arrive in a better temper if met
    on his way with silent evidence of our desire to please? And,
    again, is the advertising tradesman quite wise in offending so many
    eyes with his succession of ugly hoardings standing impertinently
in green fields?

    Can it be that the sight of them sets up that disorder of the liver
    which he promises to cure? And if not, might he not call attention to
    his wares at least as effectively, if more summarily, by making them
    the excuse for a vision of delight which passengers would drop
their newspapers to gaze upon?

Lastly, the railway companies themselves have discovered the commercial value
of scenery. Years ago, and long before their discovery (and as if by a
kind of instinct they were blundering towards it) they began to offer
prizes for the best-kept station gardens--with what happy result all who
have travelled in South Wales will remember. They should find it easy to
learn that the 'development' of watering-places and holiday resorts
may be profitably followed up by spending care upon their approaches.

But I come back to my imaginary millionaire--the benevolent man who only
wants to be instructed how to spend his money--the 'magnificent
man' of Aristotle's _Ethics_, nonplussed for the moment, and in
despair of discovering an original way of scattering largesse for
the public good.

    For, while anxious to further my scheme by conciliating the
    commercial instinct, I must insist that its true beauty
    resides in the conception of our railways as vast public
    parks only hindered by our sad lack of inventiveness from
    ministering to the daily delight of scores of thousands
    and the occasional delight of almost everyone. The
    millionaire I want is one who can rise to this conception
    of it, and say with Blake--
    "I will not cease from mental fight,"
    (Nor from pecuniary contribution, for that matter)
    "Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand Till we have built
    Jerusalem In England's green and pleasant land."

For these millionaires are bediamonded all over with good intentions.
The mischief with them is their lack of inventiveness. Most of my readers
will agree that there is no easier game of solitaire than to suppose
yourself suddenly endowed with a million of money, and to invent
modes of dispensing it for the good of your kind.

As a past master of that game I offer the above suggestion gratis
to those poor brothers of mine who have more money than they know how
to use.

The railway--not that of the quickset hedges, but the Great Western,
on to which I changed after a tramp across Dartmoor--took me to pay a
pious visit to my old school: a visit which I never pay without thinking--
especially in the chapel where we used to sing 'Lord, dismiss us with
Thy blessing' on the evening before holidays--of a passage in Izaak
Walton's _Life of Sir Henry Wotton_:--
"He yearly went also to Oxford.[Illustration: FIG. 127. PART OF A PAGE FROM A LATIN-ENGLISH EDITION OF
THE "VESTIBULUM"]

Thousands of parents, who knew nothing of Comenius and cared nothing for
his educational ideas, bought the book for their children because they
found that they liked the pictures and learned the language easily from
it. [9]

PLACE AND INFLUENCE OF COMENIUS. Comenius stands in the history of
education in a position of commanding importance. He introduces the whole
modern conception of the educational process, and outlines many of the
modern movements for the improvement of educational procedure. What
Petrarch was to the revival of learning, what Wycliffe was to religious
thought, what Copernicus was to modern science, and what Bacon and
Descartes were to modern philosophy, Comenius was to educational practice
and thinking (R. 222). The germ of almost all eighteenth- and nineteenth-
century educational theory is to be found in his work, and he, more than
any one before him and for at least two centuries after him, made an
earnest effort to introduce the new science studies into the school. Far
more liberal than his Lutheran or Calvinistic or Anglican or Catholic
contemporaries, he planned his school for the education of youth in
religion and learning and to fit them for the needs of a modern world.
Unlike the textbooks of his time, and for more than a century afterward,
his were free from either sectarian bigotry or the intense and gloomy
atmosphere of the age.

Yet Comenius lived at an unfortunate period in the history of human
progress. The early part of the seventeenth century was not a time when an
enthusiastic and aggressive and liberal-minded reformer could expect much
of a hearing anywhere in western Europe. The shock of the contest into
which western Christendom had been plunged by the challenge of Luther had
been felt in every corner of Europe, and the culmination of a century of
warfare was then raging, with all the bitterness and brutality that a
religious motive develops. Christian Europe was too filled with an
atmosphere of suspicion and distrust and hatred to be in any mood to
consider reforms for the improvement of the education of mankind. As a
result the far-reaching changes in method formulated by Comenius made but
slight impression on his contemporaries; his attempt to introduce
scientific studies awakened suspicion, rather than interest; and the new
method which he formulated in his _Great Didactic_ was ignored and the
book itself was forgotten for centuries. His great influence on
educational progress was through the reform his textbooks worked in the
teaching of Latin, and the slow infiltration into the schools of the
scientific ideas they contained. As a result, many of the fundamentally
sound reforms for which he stood had to be worked out anew in the
nineteenth century. It is sad to contemplate how far our western world
might have been advanced in its educational organization and scientific
progress, by the close of the eighteenth century, had it been in a mood to
receive and utilize the reforms in aims and methods, and to accept the new
scientific subject-matter, proposed and worked out by this far-sighted
Moravian teacher. Religious bigotry has, in all lands and ages, proved
itself one of the most serious of all obstacles in the path of human
progress.


IV. REALISM AND THE SCHOOLS

THE VERNACULAR SCHOOLS. The ideas for which the realists just described
had stood were adopted in the people's schools but slowly, and came only
after long waiting. The final incorporation of science instruction into
elementary education did not come until the nineteenth century, and then
was an outgrowth of the reform work of Pestalozzi on the one hand, and the
new social, political, economic, and industrial forces of a modern world
on the other.

The Peace of Westphalia (1648), which closed a century of bitter and
vindictive religious warfare, was followed by another century of hatred,
suspicion, and narrow religious intolerance and reaction. All parties now
adopted an extremely conservative attitude in matters of religion and
education, and the protection of orthodoxy became the chief purpose of the
school. Reading, religion, a little counting and writing, and, in Teutonic
lands, music, came to constitute the curriculum of such elementary
vernacular schools as had come to exist, and the religious Primer and the
Bible became the great school textbooks. The people were poor, much of
Europe was impoverished and depopulated as a result of long-continued
religious strife, the common people still occupied a very low social
position, there were as yet no qualified teachers, and no need for general
education aside from religion. Still more, during more than a thousand
years the Church had established the tradition of providing free
education, and when the governing authorities of the States which turned
to Protestantism had taken from the Church both the opportunity to
continue the schools and the wealth with which to maintain them, they were
seldom willing to tax themselves to set up institutions to continue the
work formerly done gratis by the Church. In consequence, regardless of
Protestant educational theory as to the need for general education, but
little progress in providing vernacular schools was made during the whole
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

Here and there in Teutonic lands, however, the new studies found an
occasional patron. In 1619 schools were organized for the little Duchy of
Weimar (p. 317) by a pupil of Ratke, and sense realism was given a place
in them. The schoolmaster, Andreas Reyher, who in 1642 drew up the _Schule
Methodus_ "the actual title of that book was 'Schulmethodus" for Duke
Ernest of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg, was familiar with the work of both
Ratke and Comenius, and made provision for instruction in "the natural and
useful sciences" (R. 163) for Duke Ernest's children. Here and there a few
other attempts to provide schools and add instruction in the new _Realien_
were made. The number of such attempts was not large, but their work was
influential, and as a result vernacular schools and science instruction
finally became established among German-speaking peoples before they did
in any other land.

THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. The influence of Milton's _Tractate_ on the non-
conformist Academies of England has been traced, and the transfer of the
idea of instruction in the new mathematical, scientific, literary,
historical, and political subjects to the new American Academies has been
mentioned. That these new studies also entered into the education of a
gentleman in England and France, under the private-tutor and the courtly-
academy system, and were copied from the French and constituted a large
part of the instruction organized for the _Ritterakademieen_ of the
numerous court cities in German lands, has also been mentioned. In both
England and France such private instruction exerted but little influence
on the existing Latin grammar schools, and in consequence the schools of
both countries remained largely unchanged in direction and purpose until
the second half of the nineteenth century. In German lands the
_Ritterakademieen_ idea experienced a further development, which proved to
be of large importance for the future of German education.

FRANCKE'S "INSTITUTIONS." With the introduction of French ideas and
training into the German courts, French skepticism in matters of religion
developed in the court circles. Under the influence of a pious Lutheran
clergyman, Philip Spener (1635-1705), who tried to emphasize religion as
an affair of the heart rather than the head; and especially as a result of
the work of his spiritual successor, Augustus Hermann Francke, a movement
arose in German lands, during the closing years of the seventeenth
century, which became known as _Pietism_. [10] Disgusted with the lifeless
and insincere religion of the time, these two strove to substitute a
religion of both head and heart. In 1695, moved by pity for the poor,
Francke established at Halle the first of his famous "Institutions,"--a
school for poor children. A pay school for the well-to-do was soon added,
and soon another school for the children of nobility. An orphan school
also was in time provided. The school for the poor developed into a
vernacular or _Burgher_ (_volks_; peoples) school; the school for the pay
pupils into a Latin School, or _Gymnasium_; and the school for nobles into
a higher scientific school, or _Pädagogium_ as it was called. At first
Francke encountered some theological opposition, but the "Institutions"
prospered, and at the time of his death contained over 2200 pupils, and
over 300 teachers, workers, and attendants.

[Illustration: FIG. 128. AUGUSTUS HERMANN FRANCKE (1663-1727)]

The interesting thing about Francke's work was the courses of instruction
he provided for his schools. [11] In the Burgher School he gave the
children instruction in history, geography, and animal life, in addition
to the reading, writing, counting, music, and religion of the usual German
vernacular school. Into the _Gymnasium_ he introduced instruction in
history, geography, music, science, and mathematics, in addition to the
usual Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He also changed the purpose of the
language instruction. Greek was studied to be able to read the New
Testament in the original, and Hebrew better to understand the Old. The
_Pädagogium_ was provided with a botanical garden, a cabinet of natural
history, physical apparatus, a laboratory for the study of chemistry and
anatomy, and a workshop for turning and glass-cutting. Independent of the
work of Comenius, but as an outgrowth of the new movement for the study of
science now beginning to influence educational thought, we have here the
most important attempt at the introduction into the school of sense
realism, or _Realien_, as the Germans say, that the modern world had so
far witnessed. In 1697 Francke added a _Seminarium Praeceptorium_, to
train teachers in his new ideas. This was the first teachers' training-
school in German lands, and the teachers he trained served to scatter his
educational ideas over the German States. [12]

THE FIRST REALSCHULE. Associated with Francke as a teacher was one
Christopher Semler (1669-1740), who became deeply interested in the new
studies of the secondary school. In 1706 Semler had submitted a plan to
the government of Magdeburg for the teaching of the practical studies.
This was referred to the Berlin Society of Sciences, which approved the
plan, and later elected Semler to membership in the Society. For years
Semler continued as a teacher at Halle, but without carrying the idea far
enough to create a new type of school. In 1739 Semler published a paper
"Upon the Mathematical, Mechanical, and Agricultural Real School in the
City of Halle," in which he described the instruction given there. This
was probably the first use of the term "real school" (Realschule). The
important subjects described as taught, aside from religion, were "the
useful and in daily life wholly indispensable sciences," such as
mathematics, drawing, geography, history, natural history, agriculture,
and economics, with much emphasis on observation by the pupils.

The work at Halle soon stimulated complaints as to the existing Latin
schools, where children, destined for business or the service of the
State, were kept trying to learn Latin, "to the neglect of more practical
and more useful studies." The usefulness of the new real studies now began
to be more correctly estimated, and the conviction gradually grew that
those boys who were destined for trade--now a rapidly increasing number--
should not be obliged to follow the same course as those destined to be
scholars. In 1720 Rector Gesner, of the gymnasium at Rotenburg, wrote,
rather sarcastically:

    The one class, who will not study, but will become tradesmen,
    merchants, or soldiers, must be instructed in writing, arithmetic,
    writing letters, geography, description of the world, and history. The
    other class may be trained for studying.

In 1742 the Rector at Dresden, Schöttgen, issued a "Humble proposal for
the special class in public city schools" to provide for those children
"who are to remain without (that is, cannot learn) Latin." Instead of
forcing them to attempt to learn Donatus, which he said was useless for
them, he urged that a special class (school) be organized to train them to
become useful merchants, artists, and mechanics. In 1751 Rector Henzky, of
Prenzlau, issued a treatise to show "That Real schools can and must become
common." In 1756 Gesner, professor at the new University of Göttingen, in
a pamphlet "On the organization of a gymnasium" (R. 223), urged that there
were three classes of youths for whom schools should be provided, one of
which needed the _Realschule_.

In 1747 a clergyman by the name of Julius Hecker (1707-1768), who had been
a pupil in, and later had taught in Francke's "'Institutions," went to
Berlin and opened there the first distinct German _Realschule_. In this
school Hecker provided instruction in religion, ethics, German, French,
Latin, mathematics, drawing, history, geography, mechanics, architecture,
and a knowledge of nature and of the human body. Classes were organized in
architecture, agriculture, bookkeeping, manufacturing, and mining. The
school prospered from the first, and in time became the "Royal
_Realschule_" of Berlin. In answer to a growing demand for advanced
education for that constantly increasing number of youths destined for the
trades or a mercantile career, the _realschule_ idea was copied in a
number of the important cities of Germany. Thus early--a century in
advance of other nations, and a century and a quarter ahead of the United
States--did Prussia lay the foundations of that scientific and technical
education which, later on, did so much toward creating modern industrial
Germany.

THE UNIVERSITIES AND THE NEW SCIENTIFIC LEARNING. Though the theological
persecution of scientific workers largely died out after about the middle
of the seventeenth century, and was never much of a factor in lands which
had embraced some form of Protestantism, the new sciences nevertheless
made but little headway in the universities until after the beginning of
the eighteenth century. Up to the close of the seventeenth century the
universities in all lands continued to be dominated by their theological
faculties, and instruction still remained largely encompassed by
mediaevalism. England represents perhaps the most notable exception to
this statement, scientific studies having been received with greater
tolerance by the universities there than in other lands. In both Catholic
and Protestant lands the need was felt for orthodox training, through fear
of further heresy, and many petty restrictions were thrown about study and
teaching which were stifling to free thinking and investigation. Each
little Kingdom or State now took over the supervision of some old
university within its borders, or established a new one, that it might
more completely control orthodoxy and prepare its own civil servants. Of
the seventeenth century, Paulsen [13] well says:

    It was essentially the period of the territorial-confessional
    university, and is characterized by a preponderance of theological-
    confessional interest.... Many new foundations, both Catholic and
    Protestant, now appeared. The chief impetus leading to these numerous
    foundations was the accentuation of the principle of territorial
    sovereignty, from the ecclesiastical as well as the political point of
    view. The consequence was that the universities began to be
    _instrumentia denominationis_ of the government as professional
    schools for its ecclesiastical and secular officials. Each individual
    government endeavored to secure its own university in order--(1) to
    make sure of wholesome instruction, which meant, of course,
    instruction in harmony with the confessional standards of its
    established church; (2) to retain training of its secular officials in
    its own hands; and finally (3) render attendance at foreign
    universities unnecessary on the part of its subjects, and thus keep
    the money in the country.

Large amounts of money were not needed to establish a new university. A
few thousand guilders or thalers sufficed for the salaries of ten or
fifteen professors, a couple of preachers and physicians would undertake
the theological and medical lectures, and some old monastery would supply
the needed buildings.

After the Reformation the law faculty increased to the place of first
importance in Protestant lands, because the Reformation had created a new
demand for judges and higher court officials to replace the rule of the
clergy. The medical faculty continued to be, as in the mediaeval
universities, the smallest of all the faculties and amounted to little
before the nineteenth century. [14] The arts faculty, or philosophical as
it came to be termed in German lands, offered lectures in Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew, and a general course in philosophy, but the Aristotelian texts
and to some extent mediaeval methods in instruction continued to be used
until the beginning of the eighteenth century.

Here and there some professor "read" on mathematics, and in Protestant
lands on the new astronomy, and the study of botany began as the study of
herbs in the medical faculty, [15] but during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries few professors or students were interested in the
scientific subjects. By 1675 Bacon's _Novum Organum_ had begun to be
taught at both Oxford and Cambridge, and by 1700 the Newtonian physics had
begun to displace Aristotle at Oxford. By 1740 it was well established
there. At first instruction in the new subjects was offered as an extra
and for a fee by men not having professional rank (R. 224), and later the
instruction was given full recognition by the university. By 1700
Cambridge had become a center for mathematical study (R. 225), and with
the growth in popularity of the Newtonian philosophy, mathematical studies
there took the place held by logic in the mediaeval university. Cambridge
has ever since remained a center for mathematical and, since the beginning
of the nineteenth century, for scientific studies as well. Between 1680
and 1700 the University of Paris was reformed, and the mathematical and
philosophical studies of Descartes (p. 394) began to be taught there. The
universities of the Netherlands began to teach the new mathematical and
scientific studies even earlier.

Aside from the above described _Realschule_ development, the new
scientific movement for a time largely passed over German lands, and in
consequence the German universities remained unreformed until the
eighteenth century. During the seventeenth century they sank to their
lowest intellectual level. In 1694, largely in protest against the
narrowness of the old universities, the new University of Halle was
founded. It received into its faculty certain forward-looking men who had
been driven from the old universities, [16] and is generally considered as
the first modern university. The new scientific and mathematical subjects
and a reformed philosophy were introduced; the instruction in Greek and
Latin was reformed; German was made the medium of classroom instruction;
and a scientific magazine in German was begun. In 1737 the University of
Göttingen became a second center of modern influence, and from these two
institutions the new scientific spirit gradually spread to all the
Protestant universities of German lands. A century later they were the
leading universities of the world.

THE TRANSITION NOW PRACTICALLY COMPLETE. From the time Petrarch made his
first "find" at Liège (1333), in the form of two previously unknown
orations of Cicero (p. 244), to the publication of the _Principia_ (p.
388) of Newton (1687), is a period of approximately three and a half
centuries. During these three and a half centuries a complete
transformation of world-life had been effected, and the mediaeval man,
with his eyes on the past, had given place to the modern man with his eyes
on the future. During these three and a half centuries revolutionary
forces had been at work in the world of ideas, and the transition from
mediaeval to modern attitudes had been accomplished. From 1333 to 1433 was
the century of "literary finds," and during this period the monastic
treasures were brought to light and edited and the classical literature of
Rome restored. Greek also was restored to the western world, and a
reformed Latin, Greek, and Hebrew were given the place of first importance
in the new humanistic school. The invention of printing took place in
1423; 1456 witnessed the appearance of the first printed book, and the
perfection of the new means for the multiplication of books and the
dissemination of ideas. Before 1500 the great era of geographical
discovery had been inaugurated; a sea-route to India was found in 1487;
and a new continent in 1492. In 1519-22 Magellan's ships rounded the
world.

In 1517 Luther issued the challenge, the shock of which was felt in every
corner of Christian Europe, and within a half-century much of northern and
western Europe had been lost to the original Roman Church. Soon
independence in thinking had been extended to the problem of the
organization of the universe, and in 1543 Copernicus issued the book that
clearly marks the beginning of modern scientific thinking and inquiry.
Bacon had done his organizing work by 1620, and Newton's _Principia_
(1687) finally established modern scientific thought and work. Comenius
died in 1671, his great organizing work done, and his textbooks, with
their many new educational ideas, in use all over Europe. The mediaeval
attitude still continued in religion and government, but the world as a
whole had left mediaeval attitudes behind it, and was facing the future of
modern world organization and life. To the educational organization of
this modern world we now turn, though before doing so we shall try to
present a cross-section, as it were, of the development in educational
theory and practice which had been attained by about the middle of the
eighteenth century.

CHAPTER XVIII

THEORY AND PRACTICE BY THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY


We have now reached, in our history of the transition age which began with
the Revival of Learning--the great events of which were the recovery of
the ancient learning, the rediscovery of the historic past, the
reawakening of scholarship, and the rise of religious and scientific
inquiry--the end of the transition period, and we are now ready to pass to
a study of the development and progress of education in modern times.
Before doing so, however, we desire to gather up and state the progress in
both educational theory and practice which had been attained by the end of
this transition period, and to present, as it were, a cross-section of
education at about the middle of the eighteenth century. To do this, then,
before passing to a consideration of educational development in modern
times, will be the purpose of this chapter. We shall first review the
progress made in evolving a theory as to the educational purpose, and then
present a cross-section view of the schools of the time under
consideration.


I. PRE-EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY EDUCATIONAL THEORIES

THE STATE PURPOSE OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS. As we saw, early in our study
of the rise and progress of the education of peoples, the City-States of
Greece were the first consciously to evolve a systematic plan of schooling
and a prolonged course of training for those who were to guide and direct
the State. In Sparta the training was almost wholly for military
efficiency and tribal safety, but in Athens we found a people using a
well-worked-out system of training to develop individual initiative,
advance civilization, and promote the welfare of the State. The education
provided was for but a class, to be sure, and a small ruling class at
that, but it was the first evidence of the new western, individualistic,
and democratic spirit expressing itself in the education of the young.
There also we found, for the first time, the thinkers of the State deeply
concerned with the education of the youth of the State, and viewing
education as a necessity to make life worth living and to secure the State
from dangers, both without and within. The training there given produced
wonderful results, and for two centuries the men educated by it ably
guided the destinies of Athens.

The essentials of this Greek training were later embodied in the private-
adventure school system that arose in Rome, which was adapted to
conditions and needs there, and which was used for the training of a few
Roman youths of the wealthier families for a political career. Schooling
at Rome, though, never attained the importance or rendered the service
that characterized education at Athens, and never became an instrument of
the State used consciously for State ends. One Roman writer, Quintilian,
as we have seen (R. 25), worked out a careful statement of the whole
process of educating a youth for a public career, and this, the first
practical treatise on education, was for long highly prized as the best-
written statement of the educational art.

THE FUTURE-LIFE CONCEPTION OF THE CHRISTIANS. With the decline of Roman
power and influence, and the victory of Christianity throughout the Roman
world, the State conception of education was entirely lost to western
Europe, and more than a thousand years elapsed before it again arose in
the western world. The Church now became the State, and the need for any
education for secular life almost entirely passed away. For centuries the
aim was almost entirely a preparation for life in the world to come.
Throughout all the early Middle Ages this attitude continued, supplemented
only by the meager education of a few to carry on the work of the Church
here below.

After the tenth century we noted the rise of some more or less independent
study in some of the monastery and cathedral schools, and after the
twelfth century the rise of _studia generalia_ marked the congregation
into groups of the few interested in a studious life. These in turn gave
rise to the university foundations, and to the beginning of independent
and secular study once more in the western world. The Revival of Learning,
the recovery of the ancient manuscripts, the revival of the study of Greek
in the West, the founding of libraries, the invention of paper and
printing, and the revival of trade and commerce--all were new forces
tending to give a new direction to scholarly study, and as a result a new
race of scholars, more or less independent of the Church, now arose in
western Europe. They were, however, a class, and a very small class at
that, and though the result of their work was the creation of a new
humanistic secondary school, this still ministered to the needs of but a
few. This few was intended either for the service of the Church, for the
governmental service of the towns which had by this time attained their
independence, or for the governments of the rising principalities or
states.

For the great mass of the people, whose purpose in life was to work and
believe and obey, agriculture, warfare, the rising trades with their
guilds (p. 209), and the services of the Church constituted almost all in
the way of education which they ever received. To be useful to his
overlord and master here and to be saved hereafter were the chief life-
purposes of the common man. The former he must himself undertake in order
to be able to live at all; the latter the Church undertook to supply to
those who followed her teachings.

THE RISE OF THE VERNACULAR RELIGIOUS SCHOOL. For the first time in
history, if we except the schools of the early Christian period, the
Protestant Revolts created a demand for some form of an elementary
religious school for all. The Protestant theory as to personal _versus_
collective salvation involved as a consequence the idea of the education
of all in the essentials of the Christian faith and doctrine. The aim was
the same as before--personal salvation--but the method was now changed
from that of the Church as intermediary to personal knowledge and faith
and effort. To be saved, one must know something of the Word of God, and
this necessitated instruction. To this end, in theory at least, schools
had to be established to educate the young for membership in the new type
of Church relationship. Reading the vernacular, a little counting and
writing, in Teutonic countries a little music, and careful instruction in
a religious Primer (R. 202), the Catechism, and the Bible, now came to
constitute the subject matter of a new vernacular school for the children
of Protestants, and to a certain extent in time for the children of
Catholics as well. As we pointed out earlier (p. 353), between this new
type of school for religious ends and the older Latin grammar school for
scholarly purposes there was almost no relationship, and the two developed
wholly independently of one another. In the Latin grammar schools one
studied to become a scholar and a leader in the political or
ecclesiastical world; in the vernacular religious school one learned to
read that he might be able to read the Catechism and the Bible, and to
know the will of the Heavenly Father. There was scarcely any other purpose
to the maintenance of the elementary vernacular schools. This condition
continued until well into the eighteenth century.

(After an etching by Boisseau, 1730-1809)]

EARLY UNSUCCESSFUL EDUCATIONAL REFORMERS. Back in the seventeenth century,
as we have pointed out in the preceding chapter, a very earnest effort was
made by Ratke and Comenius to introduce a larger conception of the
educational process into the elementary vernacular school, to eliminate
the gloomy religious material from the textbooks, to substitute a human-
welfare purpose for the exclusively life-beyond view, and to transform the
school into an institution for imparting both learning and religion.
Comenius in particular hoped to make of the new elementary religious
school a potent instrument for human progress by introducing new subject-
matter, and by formulating laws and developing methods for its work which
would be in harmony with the new scientific procedure so well stated by
Francis Bacon. Comenius stands as the commanding figure in seventeenth-
century pedagogical thought. He reasoned out and introduced us to the
whole modern conception of the educational process and purpose, and gave
to the school of the people a solid theoretical and practical basis.
Living, though, at an unfortunate period in human history, he was able to
awaken little interest either in rational teaching-method or in reforms
looking to the advancement of the welfare of mankind. Instead he roused
suspicion and distrust by the innovations and progressive reforms he
proposed; his now-celebrated book on teaching method (Rs. 218, 219) was
not at the time understood and was for long forgotten, while the
fundamentally sound ideas and pedagogical reforms which he proposed and
introduced were lost amid the hatreds of his time, and had to be worked
out again and reëstablished in a later and a more tolerant age.

Another unsuccessful reformer of some importance, and one whose work
antedated that of both Ratke and Comenius, was the London schoolmaster,
Richard Mulcaster (1531-1611), for twenty-five years headmaster of the
famous Merchant Taylors' School, and later Master of Saint Paul's School.
In 1581 he issued his _Positions_, a pedagogical work so far in advance of
his time, and written in such a heavy and affected style, that it passed
almost unnoticed in England, and did not become known at all in other
lands. Yet the things he stood for became the fundamental ideas of
nineteenth-century educational thought. These were:

    1. That the end and aim of education is to develop the body and the
       faculties of the mind, and to help nature to perfection.

    2. That all teaching processes should be adapted to the pupil taught.

    3. That the first stage in learning is of large importance, and
       requires high skill on the part of the teacher.

    4. That the thing to be learned is of less importance than the pupil
       learning.

    5. That proper brain development demands that pressure and one-sided
       education alike be avoided.

    6. That the mother tongue should be taught first and well, and should
       be the language of the school from six to twelve.

    7. That music and drawing should be taught.

    8. That reading and writing at least should be the common right of
       all, and that girls should be given equal opportunity with boys.

    9. That training colleges for teachers should be established and
       maintained.

The modern nature of many of Mulcaster's proposals may be seen from the
table of contents of his volume (R. 226). Mulcaster, like Comenius,
thought far in advance of his age, and in consequence his book was soon
and for long forgotten. Yet what Quick [1] says of him is very true:

    It would have been a vast gain to all Europe if Mulcaster had been
    followed instead of Sturm. He was one of the earliest advocates of the
    use of the vernacular instead of Latin, and good reading and writing
    in English were to be secured before Latin was begun. His elementary
    course included five things: English reading, English writing,
    drawing, singing, playing a musical instrument. If this were made to
    occupy the school time up to twelve, Mulcaster held that more would be
    done between twelve and sixteen than between seven and seventeen in
    the ordinary (Latin grammar school) way. There would be a further gain
    in that the children would not be set against learning.

John Locke, and the disciplinary theory of education. Another commanding
figure in seventeenth-century pedagogical thought was the English scholar,
philosopher, teacher, physician, and political writer, John Locke (1632-
1704). In the preceding chapter we pointed out the place of Locke as a
writer on the education of the sons of the English gentry, and illustrated
by an extract from his _Thoughts_ (R. 216) the importance he placed on
such a practical type of education as would prepare a gentleman's son for
the social and political demands of a world fast becoming modern. Locke's
place in the history of education, though, is of much more importance than
was there (p. 402) indicated. Locke was essentially the founder of modern
psychology, based on the application of the methods of modern scientific
investigation to a study of the mind, [2] and he is also of importance in
the history of educational thought as having set forth, at some length and
with much detail, the disciplinary conception of the educational process.

Locke had served as a tutor in an English nobleman's family, had worked
out his educational theories in practice and thought them through as mind
processes, and had become thoroughly convinced that it was the process of
learning that was important, rather than the thing learned. Education to
him was a process of disciplining the body, fixing good habits, training
the youth in moral situations, and training the mind through work with
studies selected because of their disciplinary value. This conception of
education he sets forth well in the following paragraph, taken from his
_Thoughts:_

    The great Work of the Governor is to fashion the Carriage and form the
    Mind; to settle in his Pupils good Habits and the Principles of Virtue
    and Wisdom; to give him by little and little a View of Mankind, and
    work him into a Love and Imitation of what is excellent and
    praiseworthy; and in the Prosecution of it, to give him Vigor,
    Activity, and Industry. The Studies which he sets him upon, are but as
    it were the Exercise of his Faculties, and Employment of his Time, to
    keep him from Sauntering and Idleness, to teach him Application, and
    accustom him to take Pains, and to give him some little Taste of what
    his own Industry must perfect (§94).

In his _Thoughts_ Locke first sets forth at length the necessity for
disciplining the body by means of diet, exercise, and the hardening
process. "A sound mind in a sound body" he conceives to be "a short but
full description of a happy state in this world," and a fundamental basis
for morality and learning. The formation of good habits and manners
through proper training, and the proper adjustment of punishments and
rewards next occupies his attention, and he then explains his theory as to
making all punishments the natural consequences of acts. Similarly the
mind, as the body, must be disciplined to virtue by training the child to
deny, subordinate desires, and apply reason to acts. The formation of good
habits and the disciplining of the desires Locke regards as the
foundations of virtue. On this point he says:

    As the Strength of the Body lies chiefly in being able to endure
    Hardship, so also does that of the Mind. And the great Principle and
    Foundation of all Virtue and Worth is plac'd in this:--That a Man is
    able to _deny himself_ his own Desires, cross his own
    Inclinations, and purely follow what Reason directs as best, tho' the
    Appetite lean the other Way (§ 33).

Similarly, in intellectual education, good thinking and the employment of
reason is the aim, and these, too, must be attained through the proper
discipline of the mind. Good intellectual education does not consist
merely in studying and learning, he contends, as was the common practice
in the grammar schools of his time, but must be achieved by a proper
drilling of the powers of the mind through the use of selected studies.
The purpose of education, he holds, is above all else to make man a
reasoning creature. Nothing, in his judgment, trains to reason closely so
well as the study of mathematics, though Locke would have his boy "look
into all sorts of knowledge," and train his understanding with a wide
variety of exercises. In the education given in the grammar schools of his
time he found much that seemed to him wasteful of time and thoroughly bad
in principle, and he used much space to point out defects and describe
better methods of teaching and management, giving in some detail reasons
therefor. His ideas as to needed reforms in the teaching of Latin (R. 227)
are illustrative.

LOCKE ON ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. For the beginnings of education, and for
elementary education in general, Locke sticks close to the prevailing
religious conception of his time. As for the education of the common
people, he writes:

    The knowledge of the Bible and the business of his own calling is
    enough for the ordinary man; a Gentleman ought to go further.

Continuing regarding the beginnings of education and the studies and
textbooks of his day, he says:

    The Lord's Prayer, the Creeds, and the Ten Commandments, 't is
    necessary he should learn perfectly by heart.... What other Books
    there are in _English_ of the Kind of those above-mentioned
    (besides the Primer) fit to engage the Liking of Children, and tempt
    them to _read_, I do not know;... and nothing that I know has
    been considered of this Kind out of the ordinary Road of the Horn
    Book, Primer, Psalter, Testament, and Bible (§ 157).

Locke does, however, give some very sensible suggestions as to the reading
of the Bible (R. 228), the imparting of religious ideas to children, and
the desirability of transforming instruction so as to make it pleasant and
agreeable, with plenty of natural playful activity. [3] On this point he
writes:

    He that has found a Way how to keep up a Child's Spirit easy, active,
    and free, and yet at the same time to restrain him from many Things he
    has a Mind to, and to draw him to Things that are uneasy to him; he, I
    say, that knows how to reconcile these seeming Contradictions, has, in
    my Opinion, got the true Secret of Education (§ 46).

INFLUENCE OF LOCKE'S _THOUGHTS_. The volume by Locke contains much that is
sensible in the matter of educating a boy. The emphasis on habit
formation, reasoning, physical activities and play, the individuality of
children, and a reformed method in teaching are its strong points. The
thoroughly modern character of the book, in most respects, is one of its
marked characteristics. The volume seems to have been much read by middle
and upper-class Englishmen, and copies of it have been found in so many
old colonial collections that it was probably well known among early
eighteenth-century American colonists. That the book had an important
influence on the attitude of the higher social classes of England toward
the education of their sons and, consciously or unconsciously, in time
helped to redirect the teaching in that most characteristic of English
educational institutions, the English Public (Latin Grammar) School, seems
to be fairly clear. On elementary religious and charity-school education
it had practically no influence.

Locke's great influence on educational thought did not come, though, for
nearly three quarters of a century afterward, and it came then through the
popularization of his best ideas by Rousseau. Karl Schmidt [4] well says
of his work:

Locke is a thorough Englishman, and the principle underlying his education
is the principle according to which the English people have developed.
Hence his theory of education has in the history of pedagogy the same
value that the English nation has in the history of the world. He stood in
strong opposition to the scholastic and formalized education current in
his time, a living protest against the prevailing pedantry; in the
universal development of pedagogy he gives impulse to the movement which
grounds education upon sound psychological principles, and lays stress
upon breeding and the formation of character.

Restating and expanding the leading ideas of Locke in his _Emile_ (chapter
XXI), and putting them into far more attractive literary form, Rousseau
scattered Locke's ideas as to educational reform over Europe. In
particular Rousseau popularized Locke's ideas as to the replacement of
authority by reason and investigation, his emphasis on physical activity
and health, his contention that the education of children should be along
lines that were natural and normal for children, and above all Locke's
plea for education through the senses rather than the memory. In so
popularizing Locke's ideas, and at a time when all the political
tendencies of the period were in the direction of the rejection of
authority and the emphasis of the individual, those educational reformers
who were inspired by the writings of Rousseau created and applied, largely
on the foundations laid down by John Locke, a new theory as to educational
aims and procedure which dominated all early nineteenth-century
instruction. This we shall trace further in a subsequent chapter (chapter
XXI).

It was at this point that the educational problem stood, in so far as a
theory as to educational aims and the educational process was concerned,
when Rousseau took it up (1762). Before passing to a consideration of his
work, though, and the work of those inspired by him and by the French
revolutionary writers and statesmen, let us close this third part of our
history by a brief survey of the development so far attained, the purpose,
character, aims, and nature of instruction in the schools, and their means
of support and control at about the middle of the century in which
Rousseau wrote, and before the philosophical and political revolutions of
the latter half of the eighteenth century had begun to influence
educational aims and procedure and control.


II. MID-EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS

THE PURPOSE. The purpose of maintaining the elementary vernacular school,
in all European lands, remained at the middle of the eighteenth century
much as it was a century before, though in the German States and in the
American Colonies there was a noticeable shifting of emphasis from the
older exclusively religious purpose toward a newer conception of education
as preparation for life in the world here. Still, one learned to read
chiefly "to learn some orthodox Catechism," "to read fluently in the New
Testament," and to know the will of God, or, as stated in the law of the
Connecticut Colony (R. 193), "in some competent measure to understand the
main grounds and principles of Christian religion necessary to salvation."
The teacher was still carefully looked after as to his "soundness in the
faith" (R. 238 a); he was required "to catechise his scholars in the
principles of the Christian religion," and "to commend his labors amongst
them unto God by prayer morning and evening, [5] taking care that his
scholars do reverently attend during the same." The minister in
practically all lands examined the children as to their knowledge of the
Catechism and the Bible, and on his visits quizzed them as to the Sunday
sermon. In Boston (1710) the ministers were required, on their school
visits, to pray with the pupils, and "to entertain them with some
instructions of piety adapted to their age." In Church-of-England schools
"the End and Chief Design" of the schools established continued to be
instruction in "the Knowledge and Practice of the Christian Religion as
Professed and Taught in the Church of England" (R. 238 b). In German lands
the elementary vernacular school was still regarded as "the portico of the
Temple," "Christianity its principal work," and not as "mere
establishments preparatory to public life, but be pervaded by the
religious spirit." [6] The uniform system of public schools ordered
established for Prussia by Frederick the Great, in 1763, were after all
little more than religious schools (R. 274), conducted for purposes of
both Church and State. As Frederick expressed it, "we find it necessary
and wholesome to have a good foundation laid in the schools by a rational
and a Christian education of the young for the fear of God, and other
useful ends." In the schools of La Salle's organization, which was most
prominent in elementary vernacular education in Catholic France, the aim
continued to be (R. 182) "to teach them to live honestly and uprightly, by
instructing them in the principles of our holy religion and by teaching
them Christian precepts."

WEAKENING OF THE OLD RELIGIOUS THEORY. By the middle of the eighteenth
century, however, there is a noticeable weakening of the hold of the old
religious theory on the schools in most Protestant lands. In England there
was a marked relaxation of the old religious intolerance in educational
matters as the century proceeded, and new textbooks, embodying but little
of the old gloomy religious material, appeared and began to be used. By a
series of decisions, between 1670 and 1701 (chapter XXIV), the English
courts broke the hold of the bishops in the matter of the licensing of
elementary schoolmasters, and by the Acts of 1713 and 1714 the Dissenters
were once more allowed to conduct schools of their own. Coincident with
this growth of religious tolerance among the English we find the Church of
England redoubling its efforts to hold the children of its adherents, by
the organization of parish schools and the creation of a vast system of
charitable religious schools. In German lands, too, a marked shifting of
emphasis away from solely religious ends and toward the needs of the
government began, toward the end of the eighteenth century, to be evident.
In Würtemberg, which was somewhat typical of late eighteenth-century
action by other German States, a Circular of the General Synod, of
November 1787, declares the German schools to be "those nurseries in which
should be taught the true and genuine idea of the duties of men--created
with a reasoning soul toward God, government, their fellow-men, and
themselves, and also at least the first rudiments of useful and
indispensable knowledge."

It was in the American Colonies, though, that the waning of the old
religious interest was most notable. Due to rude frontier conditions, the
decline in force of the old religious-town governments, the diversity of
sects, the rise of new trade and civil interests, and the breakdown of
old-home connections, the hold on the people of the old religious
doctrines was weakened there earlier than in the old world. By 1750 the
change in religious thinking in America had become quite marked. As a
consequence many of the earlier parochial schools had died out, while in
the New England Colonies the colonial governments had been forced to
exercise an increasing state oversight of the elementary school to keep it
from dying out there as well.

STUDIES AND TEXTBOOKS. The studies of the elementary vernacular school
remained, throughout the whole of the eighteenth century, much as before,
namely, reading, a little writing and ciphering, some spelling, religion,
and in Teutonic countries a little music. La Salle (R. 182) had
prescribed, for the Catholic vernacular schools of France, instruction in
French, some. Latin, "orthography, arithmetic, the matins and vespers, le
Pater, l'Ave Maria, le Credo et le Confiteor, the Commandments, responses,
Catechism, duties of a Christian, and maxims and precepts drawn from the
Testament." The Catechism was to be taught one half-hour daily. The
schoolbooks in England in Locke's day, as he tells us (p. 435), were "the
Horn Book, Primer, Psalter, Testament, and Bible." These indicate merely a
religious vernacular school. The purpose stated for the English Church
charity-schools (R. 238 b), schools that attained to large importance in
England and the American Colonies during the eighteenth century, shows
them to have been, similarly, religious vernacular schools. The _School
Regulations_ which Frederick the Great promulgated for Prussia (1763),
fixed the textbooks to be used (R. 274, § 20), and indicate that the
instruction in Prussia was still restricted to reading, writing, religion,
singing, and a little arithmetic. Mr. Hardy wrote a few mournfully
memorable lines on the seamy side of war. Mr. Owen Seaman (who may
pass for our contemporary Aristophanes) was smart and witty at the
expense of those whose philosophy goes a little deeper than surface-polish.
One man alone--Mr. Henry Newbolt--struck a note which even his opponents
had to respect.

The rest exhibited plenty of the turbulence of passion, but none
of the gravity of thoughtful emotion.

I don't doubt they were, one and all, honest in their way.
But as poetry their utterances were negligible. As writers of real poetry
the Anti-Jingoes, and especially the Celts, held and still hold the field.

I will not adduce poets of admitted eminence--Mr. Watson, for instance, or
Mr. Yeats--to prove my case. I am content to go to a young poet who has
his spurs to win, and will ask you to consider this little poem, and
especially its final stanza.

    He calls it--
    
    A CHARGE
    If thou hast squander'd years to grave a gem
    Commissioned by thy absent Lord, and while 'Tis
    incomplete, Others would bribe thy needy skill to them-- Dismiss
them to the street!

Should'st thou at last discover Beauty's grove, At last be panting on
the fragrant verge, But in the track, Drunk with divine possession,
thou meet Love-- Turn, at her bidding, back.

When round thy ship in tempest Hell appears, And every spectre mutters up
more dire To snatch control And loose to madness thy deep-kennell'd
Fears,-- Then to the helm, O Soul!

Last, if upon the cold, green-mantling sea Thou cling, alone with Truth,
to the last spar, Both castaway, And one must perish--let it not be
he Whom thou art sworn to obey.

The author of these lines is a Mr. Herbert Trench, who (as I say)
has his spurs to win. Yet I defy you to read them without recognising a
note of high seriousness which is common to our great poets and utterly
foreign to our modern bards of empire.

The man, you will perceive, dares to talk quite boldly about the human
soul. Now you will search long in our Jingo bards for any recognition
of the human soul: the very word is unpopular. And as men of eminence
write, so lesser wits imitate. A while ago I picked up a popular magazine,
and happened on these verses--fluently written and, beyond a doubt,
honestly meant. They are in praise of King Henry VIII.:--
King Harry played at tennis, and he threw the dice a-main, And did all
things that seemed to him for his own and England's gain; He would
not be talked to lightly, he would not be checked or chid; And he got
what things he dreamed to get, and did-- what things he did.

When Harry played at tennis it was well for this our Isle-- He cocked his
nose at Interdicts; he 'stablished us the while-- He was lustful; he was
vengeful; he was hot and hard and proud; But he set his England
fairly in the sight of all the crowd.

So Harry played at tennis, and we perfected the game Which astonished
swaggering Spaniards when the fat Armada came.
And possession did he give us of our souls in sturdiness; And he gave us
peace from priesthood: and he gave us English Bess!

When Harry played at tennis we began to know this thing-- That a mighty
people prospers in a mighty-minded king.
We boasted not our righteousness--we took on us our sin, For Bluff Hal was
just an Englishman who played the game to win.

You will perceive that in the third stanza
the word 'soul' occurs:

and I invite you to compare this author's idea of a soul with Mr.
Trench's. This author will have nothing to do with the old advice about
doing justice, loving mercy, and walking humbly before God.
The old notion that to conquer self is a higher feat than to take a
city he dismisses out of hand. "Be lustful be vengeful," says he, "but
play the game to win, and you have my applause. Get what you want, set
England fairly in sight of the crowd, and you are a mighty-minded
man." Now the first and last comment upon such a doctrine must be that,
if a God exist, it is false. It sets up a part to override the whole:
it flaunts a local success against the austere majesty of Divine law.
In brief, it foolishly derides the universal, saying that it chooses to
consider the particular as more important. But it is not. Poetry's concern
is with the universal:

and what makes the Celts (however much you may
dislike them) the most considerable force in English
poetry at this moment is that they occupy themselves with that
universal truth, which, before any technical accomplishment, is the
guarantee of good poetry.

Now, when you tell yourself that the days of 'English Bess' were jolly
fine empire-making days, and produced great poets (Shakespeare, for
example) worthy of them; and when you go on to reflect that these
also are jolly fine empire-making days, but that somehow Mr. Austin is
your laureate, and that the only poetry which counts is being written
by men out of harmony with your present empire-making mood, the easiest
plan (if you happen to think the difference worth considering) will
be to call the Muse a traitress, and declare that every poem better than
Mr. Austin's is a vote given to--whatever nation your Yellow Press happens
to be insulting at this moment.
But, if you care to look a little deeper, you may find that some difference
in your methods of empire-making is partly accountable for the change. A
true poet must cling to universal truth; and by insulting it (as, for
example, by importing into present-day politics the spirit which would
excuse the iniquities of Henry VIII. on the ground that 'he gave us English
Bess'!) you are driving the true poet out of your midst. Read over the
verses above quoted, and then repeat to yourself, slowly, these lines:--

"Last, if upon the cold, green-mantling sea Thou cling, alone with Truth,
to the last spar, Both castaway, And one must perish--let it not be he Whom
thou art sworn to obey."
I ask no more. If a man cannot see the difference at once, I almost despair
of making him perceive why poetry refuses just now even more obstinately
than trade (if that be possible) to 'follow the flag.' It will not follow,
because you are waving the flag over self-deception.

You may be as blithe as Plato in casting out the poets from your

commonwealth--though for other reasons than his.

You may be as blithe as Dogberry in determining, of reading and writing,
that they may appear when there is no need of such vanity.
But you are certainly driving them forth to say, in place of "O beloved
city of Cecrops!" "O beloved city of God!" There was a time, not
many years ago, when an honest poet could have used both cries together
and deemed that he meant the same thing by the two.
But the two cries to-day have an utterly different meaning--and by your
compulsion or by the compulsion of such politics as you have come to
tolerate.

And therefore the young poet whom I have quoted has joined the band of
those poets whom we are forcing out of the city, to leave our
ideals to the fate which, since the world began, has overtaken all
ideals which could not get themselves 'accepted by song.'

Even as we drum these poets out we know that they are the only ones worth
reckoning with, and that man cannot support himself upon assurances that
he is the strongest fellow in the world, and the richest, and
owns the biggest house, and pays the biggest rates, and wins whatever game
he plays at, and stands so high in his clothes that while the Southern Cross
rises over his hat-brim it is already broad day on the seat of his breeches.
For that is what it all comes to: and the sentence upon the man who neglects
the warning of these poets, while he heaps up great possessions, is still,
"Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee." And where
is the national soul you would choose, at that hasty summons, to present
for inspection, having to stand your trial upon it? Try Park Lane,
or run and knock up the Laureate, and then come and report your success!

    Weeks ago I was greatly reproached by a correspondent for misusing
the word 'Celtic,' and informed that to call Mr.

    Yeats or Mr. Trench a Celt is a grave abuse of ethnical terms; that
    a notable percentage of the names connected with the 'Celtic
Revival'--Hyde, Sigerson, Atkinson, Stokes--are not Celtic at all
but Teutonic; that, in short, I have been following the multitude
to speak loosely.

Well, I confess it, and I will confess further that the lax use of the
word 'Celt' ill beseems one who has been irritated often enough by
the attempts of well-meaning but muddle-headed people who get hold of this
or that poet and straightly assign this or that quality of his
verse to a certain set of corpuscles in his mixed blood. Although I
believe that my correspondent is too hasty in labelling men's descent
from their names--for the mother has usually some share in producing a
child; although I believe that Mr. Yeats, for instance, inherits Cornish
blood on one side, even if Irish be denied him on the other; yet
the rebuke contains some justice.

Still, I must maintain that these well-meaning theorists err
only in applying a broad distinction with overmuch nicety.

There is, after all, a certain quality in a poem of Blake's, or a prose
passage of Charlotte Bronte's, which a critic is not only unable to ignore,
but which--if he has any 'comparative' sense--he finds himself accounting
for by saying, "This man, or this woman, must be a Celt or have some
admixture of Celtic blood." I say quite confidently that quality cannot
be ignored. You open (let us say) a volume of Blake, and your eye
falls on these two lines--
"When the stars threw down their spears And watered heaven with their
tears,"
And at once you are aware of an imagination different in kind from
the imagination you would recognise as English.

Let us, if you please, rule out all debate of superiority; let us take
Shakespeare for comparison, and Shakespeare at his best:--
"These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into
air, into thin air; And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The
cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great
globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve And, like this
insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As
dreams are made of, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep."

Finer poetry than this I can hardly find in English to quote for you.
But fine as it is, will you not observe the matter-of-factness (call it
healthy, if you will, and I shall not gainsay you) beneath Shakespeare's
noble language? It says divinely what it has to say; and what it has to
say is full of solemn thought. But, for better or worse (or, rather,
without question of better or worse), Blake's imagination is moving
on a different plane. We may think it an uncomfortably superhuman plane;
but let us note the difference, and note further that this plane was
habitual with Blake. Now because of his immense powers we are
accustomed to think of Shakespeare as almost superhuman: we pay that tribute
to his genius, his strength, and the enormous impression they produce
on us. But a single couplet of Blake's will carry more of this
uncanny superhuman imagination than the whole five acts of _Hamlet_. So
great is Shakespeare, that he tempts us to think him capable of any flight
of wing; but set down a line or two of Blake's--
"A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage . . .
A skylark wounded on the wing Doth make a cherub cease to sing."
--And, simple as the thought is, at once you feel it to lie outside the
range of Shakespeare's philosophy. Shakespeare's men are fine, brave,
companionable fellows, full of passionate love, jealousy, ambition;
of humour, gravity, strength of mind; of laughter and rage, of the
joy and stress of living. But self-sacrifice scarcely enters into
their notion of the scheme of things, and they are by no means men to
go to death for an idea. We remember what figure Shakespeare made of Sir
John Oldcastle, and I wish we could forget what figure he made of Joan of
Arc. Within the bounds of his philosophy--the philosophy, gloriously
stated, of ordinary brave, full-blooded men-- he is a great
encourager of virtue; and so such lines as--
"The expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action . . ."

Are thoroughly Shakespearean, while such
lines as--

"A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage . . ."
Are as little Shakespearean in thought as in phrasing. He can tell
us that:

"We are such stuff As dreams are made of, and our little life Is rounded
with a sleep."
He can muse on that sleep to come:--
"To die, to sleep; To sleep; perchance to dream; aye, there's the
rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have
shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause."

But that even in this life we may be more truly ourselves when dreaming
than when waking--that what we dream may perchance turn out to be more
real and more important than what we do--such a thought overpasses his
imaginative range; or, since to dogmatise on his imaginative range
is highly dangerous, let us be content with saying that it lies outside
his temperament, and that he would have hit on such a thought only to
dismiss it with contempt. So when we open a book of poems and come
upon a monarch crying out that:

"A wild and foolish labourer is a king, To do and do and do and never
dream,"
We know that we are hearkening to a note which is not Shakespearean at
all, not practical, not English. And we want a name for that note.

I have followed the multitude to call it Celtic because in practice when
we come upon this note we are pretty safe to discover that the poet
who utters it has Celtic blood in him (Blake's poetry, for instance,
told me that he must be an Irishman before ever I reflected that
his name was Irish, or thought of looking up his descent).
Since, however the blood of most men in these islands is by this
time mixed with many strains: since also, though the note be not
native with him, nothing forbids even a pure-blooded Anglo-Saxon
from learning it and assimilating it: lastly, since there is obvious
inconvenience in using the same word for an ethnical delimitation
and a psychological, when their boundaries do not exactly correspond--and
if some Anglo-Saxons have the 'Celtic' note it is certain that many
thousands of Celts have not; why then I shall be glad enough to use
a better and a handier and a more exact, if only some clever person
will provide it.

  Meanwhile, let it be understood that in
  speaking of a 'Celtic' note I accuse no
  fellow-creature of being an Irishman, Scotsman,
  Welshman, Manxman, Cornishman, or Breton.
  The poet will as a rule turn out to be one or other of these, or
at least to have a traceable strain of Celtic blood in him.

But to the note only is the term applied, Now
this note may be recognised by many tokens; but the first and
chiefest is its insistence upon man's brotherhood with bird and
beast, star and flower, everything, in short, which we loosely call
'nature,' his brotherhood even with spirits and angels, as one of
an infinite number of microcosms reflecting a common image of God.

And poetry which holds by this creed will hardly be subservient to
societies and governments and legalised doctrines and conventions;
it will hold to them by a long and loose chain, if at all.

  It flies high enough, at any rate, to take
  a bird's-eye view of all manner of
  things which in the temple, the palace, or the market-place, have
come to be taken as axiomatic.

It eyes them with an extraordinary 'dissoluteness'--if you will give that
word its literal meaning. It sees that some accepted virtues carry no
reflection of heaven; it sees that heaven, on the other hand--so
infinite is its care--may shake with anger from bound to bound at
the sight of a caged bird.

It sees that the souls of living things, even of the least
conspicuous, reach up by chains and are anchored in heaven, while 'great'
events slide by on the surface of this skimming planet with empires and
their ordinances.

"And so the Emperor went in the procession under the splendid canopy. And
all the people in the streets and at the windows said, 'Bless us! what
matchless new clothes our Emperor has!' But he hasn't anything on!' cried
a little child. 'Dear me, just listen to what the little innocent says,'
observed his father, and the people whispered to each other what the child
had said. 'He hasn't anything on!' they began to shout at last.
This made the Emperor's flesh creep, because he thought that they were
right; but he said to himself, 'I must keep it up through the procession,
anyhow.' And he walked on still more majestically, and the Chamberlains
walked behind and carried the train, though there was none to carry."

This parable of the Emperor without clothes can be matched, for
simplicity and searching directness, against any parable outside of the
Gospels, and it agrees with the Divine parables in exalting the wisdom of
a child. I will not dare to discuss that wisdom here.

I observe that when the poets preach it we tender them our applause.
We applaud Vaughan's lines:--
"Happy those early days, when I Shin'd in my angel-infancy . . .
When yet I had not walk'd above A mile or two from my first love, And looking
back--at that short space-- Could see a glimpse of His bright face; When
on some gilded cloud or flow'r My gazing soul would dwell an hour, And
in those weaker glories spy Some shadows of eternity. . . ."
We applaud Wordsworth's glorious ode--
"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:

The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, Hath had
elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar:
Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing
clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!

. . ."
We applaud even old John Earle's prose when he tells us of a Child that--

"The elder he grows, he is a stair lower from God; and, like his first
father, much worse in his breeches. He is the Christian's example, and
the old man's relapse; the one imitates his pureness, the other
falls into his simplicity. . . .

    His father hath writ him as his own little story, wherein he reads those
    days of his life that he cannot remember, and sighs to see what innocence
    he hath outlived. . . . Could he put off his body with his little
    coat, he had got eternity without a burden, and exchanged but one
    heaven for another."
    But while we applaud this pretty confident attribution of divine
    wisdom to children, we are much too cautious to translate it into
practice.

"It is far too shadowy a notion," says Wordsworth prudently, "to be recommended
to faith as more than an element in our instincts of immortality;" and he
might have added that, while the Child may be Father of the Man,
the Man reserves the privilege of spanking.

    Even so I observe that, while able
    to agree cordially with Christ on
    the necessity of becoming as little
    children as a condition of entering
    the Kingdom of Heaven, we are not so injudicious as to act upon
any such belief; nay, we find ourselves obliged to revise and
re-interpret the wisdom of the Gospels when we find it too impracticably
childish.

When Christ, for instance, forbids oaths of all kinds, we feel sure He
cannot be serious, or we should have to upset a settled practice of the
courts. And as for resisting no evil and forgiving our enemies, why, good
Heavens! what would become of our splendid armaments! The suggestion,
put so down rightly, is quite too wild. In short, as a distinguished
Bishop put it, society could not exist for forty-eight hours on the lines
laid down in the Sermon on the Mount. (I forget the Bishop's exact words,
but they amounted to a complete and thoroughly common-sense
repudiation of Gospel Christianity.)

    No; it is obvious that, in so far as the Divine teaching touches
    on conduct, we must as practical men correct it, and with a special
    look-out for its indulgent misunderstanding of children.

Children, as a matter of experience, have no sense of the
rights of property.

They steal apples.

And yet--there must be something in this downright wisdom of childishness
since Christ went (as we must believe) out of His way to lay such
stress on it; and since our own hearts respond so readily when
Vaughan or Wordsworth claim divinity for it.

We cannot of course go the length of believing that the great, wise, and
eminent men of our day are engaged one and all in the pursuit of
shadows.
'Shadows we are and shadows we pursue' sounded an exquisitely solemn note
in an election speech; but after all, we must take the world as we find
it, and the world as we find it has its own recognised rewards. No
success attended the poet who wrote that--
"Those little new-invented things-- Cups, saddles, crowns, are
childish joys, So ribbands are and rings, Which all our happiness
destroys.

    Nor God In His abode, Nor saints, nor little boys, Nor Angels made them;
    only foolish men, Grown mad with custom, on those toys Which more
    increase their wants to date. . . ."
    He found no publisher, and they have been rescued by accident after
two hundred years of oblivion.

(It appears, nevertheless, that he was a happy man.)
And yet--I repeat--since we respond to it so readily, whether in welcome
or in irritation, there must be something in this claim set up for
childish simplicity; and I cannot help thinking it fortunate and salutary
for us that the Celtic poets have taken to sounding its note so boldly.
Whatever else they do, on the conventional ideals of this generation they
speak out with an uncompromising and highly disconcerting directness.

As I said just now, they are held, if at all, by a long and
loose chain to the graven images to which we stand bound arm-to-arm
and foot-to-foot.

They fly far enough aloof to take a bird's-eye view. What they see
they declare with a boldness which is the more impressive for being
unconscious. And they declare that they see us tied to stupid material
gods, and wholly blind to ideas.

P.S.--I made bold enough to say in the course of these remarks that Euclid's
_Elements_ could hardly be improved by writing them out in ballad
metre. A friend, to whom I happened to repeat this assertion, cast
doubt on it and challenged me to prove it. I do so with pleasure in the
following--
[In the original text, there is shown a geometrical diagram which consists
of two equally sized circles superimposed so that they each intersect
the other's centre which points are marked A and B. The outermost points
on the two circles in line with AB are marked D and E.

The upper point where the two circles intersect is marked C and an
equilateral triangle is shown by joining points A, B and C.]

Of this school it is recorded that poor children

    "being taken into the said Workhouse are there taught to Read and
    Write, and kept to Work until they are qualified to be put out to be
    Apprentices, and for the Sea Service, or otherwise disposed; ... The
    Habit of the Children is all the same, being made of Russit Cloth, and
    a round Badge worn upon their Breast, representing a poor Boy, and
    a Sheep; the Motto: '_God's Providence is our Inheritance_.'" ...
    In this workhouse children were "taught to spin Wool and Flax, to Sow
    and Knit, to make their own Cloaths, Shoes, and Stockings, and the
    like Employments; to inure them betimes to labour. They are also
    taught to read, and such as are capable, to write and cast Accounts;
    and also the Catechism, to ground them in Principles of Religion and
    Honesty." [21]

The school established by Saint John's parish, Southwark, London, in 1735,
and designed to train and "put out" girls for domestic service (R. 241),
and which cared for, clothed, and trained forty girls, is also typical of
these parish schools "for the children of the industrious poor."

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. Throughout the eighteenth century the method of
instruction commonly employed in the vernacular schools was what was known
as the individual method. This was wasteful of both time and effort, and
unpedagogical to a high degree (R. 244). Everywhere the teacher was
engaged chiefly in hearing recitations, testing memory, and keeping order.
The pupils came to the master's desk, one by one (see Figures 98, 99), and
recited what they had memorized. Aside from imposing discipline, teaching
was an easy task. The pupils learned the assigned lessons and recited what
they had learned. Such a thing as methodology--technique of instruction--
was unknown. The dominance of the religious motive, too, precluded any
liberal attitude in school instruction, the individual method was time-
consuming, school buildings often were lacking, and in general there was
an almost complete lack of any teaching equipment, books, or supplies.
Viewed from any modern standpoint the schools of the eighteenth century
attained to but a low degree of efficiency (R. 244). The school hours were
long, the schoolmaster's residence or place of work or business was
commonly used as a schoolroom, and such regular schoolrooms as did exist
were dirty and noisy and but poorly suited to school purposes. Schools
everywhere, too, were ungraded, the school of one teacher being like that
of any other teacher of that class.

So wasteful of time and effort was the individual method of instruction
that children might attend school for years and get only a mere start in
reading and writing. Paulsen, [22] writing of schools in German lands at
an even later date, says that even in the better type of vernacular
schools

    many children never achieved anything beyond a little reading and
    knowing a few things by heart.... The instruction in reading was never
    anything else but a torture, protracted through years, from saying the
    alphabet and formation of syllables to the deciphering of complete
    words, without any real success in the end, while writing was nothing
    but a wearisome tracing of the letters, the net result of all the toil
    being the gabbling of the Catechism and a few Bible texts and hymns,
    learned over and over again.

The imparting of information by the teacher to a class, or a class
discussion of a topic, were almost unknown. Hearing lessons, assigning new
tasks, setting copies, making quill pens, dictating sums, and imposing
order completely absorbed the time and the attention of the teacher.

SCHOOL DISCIPLINE. The discipline everywhere was severe. "A boy has a
back; when you hit it he understands," was a favorite pedagogical maxim of
the time. Whipping-posts were sometimes set up in the schoolroom, and
practically all pictures of the schoolmasters of the time show a bundle of
switches near at hand. Boys in the Latin grammar schools were flogged for
petty offenses (R. 245). The ability to impose order on a poorly taught
and, in consequence, an unruly school was always an important requisite of
the schoolmaster. A Swabian schoolmaster, Häuberle by name, with
characteristic Teutonic attention to details, has left on record [23]
that, in the course of his fifty-one years and seven months as a teacher
he had, by a moderate computation, given 911,527 blows with a cane,
124,010 blows with a rod, 20,989 blows and raps with a ruler, 136,715
blows with the hand, 10,235 blows over the mouth, 7,905 boxes on the ear,
1,115,800 raps on the head, and 22,763 _notabenes_ with the Bible,
Catechism, singing book, and grammar. He had 777 times made boys kneel on
peas, 613 times on a triangular piece of wood, had made 3001 wear the
jackass, and 1707 hold the rod up, not to mention various more unusual
punishments he had contrived on the spur of the occasion. Of the blows
with the cane, 800,000 were for Latin words; of the rod 76,000 were for
texts from the Bible or verses from the singing book. He also had about
3000 expressions to scold with, two thirds of which were native to the
German tongue and the remainder his invention.

Another illustration of German school discipline, of many that might be
cited, was the reform work of Johann Ernest Christian Haun, who was
appointed, in 1783, as inspector of schools in the once famous Gotha (p.
317). Due to warfare and neglect the schools there had fallen into
disrepute. Haun drove the incapable teachers from the work, and for a time
restored the schools to something of their earlier importance. Among other
reforms it is recorded that he forbade teachers to put irons around the
boys' necks, to cover them with mud, to make them kneel on peas, or to
brutally beat them. Diesterweg (R. 244) describes similar punishments as
characteristic of eighteenth-century German schools. The eighteenth-
century German schoolmaster shown in Fig. 142 was probably a good sample
of his class.

Pedagogical writers of the time uniformly complain of the severe
discipline of the schools, and the literature of the period abounds in
allusions to the prevailing harshness of the school discipline. A few
writers condemn, but most approve heartily of the use of the rod. "Spare
the rod and spoil the child" had for long been a well-grounded pedagogical
doctrine. Among many literary extracts that might be cited illustrating
this belief, the following poem by the English poet Crabbe (1754-1832) is
interesting. He puts the following words into the mouth of his early
schoolmaster:

  Students like horses on the road,
  Must be well lashed before they take the load;
  They may be willing for a time to run,
  But you must whip them ere the work be done;
  To tell a boy, that if he will improve,
  His friends will praise him, and his parents love,
  Is doing nothing--he has not a doubt
  But they will love him, nay, applaud without;
  Let no fond sire a boy's ambition trust,
  To make him study, let him learn he must.

CONDITIONS SURROUNDING CHILDHOOD. It is difficult for us of today to re-
create in imagination the pitiful life-conditions which surrounded
children a century and a half ago. Often the lot of the children of the
poor, who then constituted the great bulk of all children, was little less
than slavery. Wretchedly poor, dirty, unkempt, hard-worked, beaten about,
knowing strong drink early, illiterate, often vicious--their lot was a sad
one. For the children of the poor there were few, if any, educational
opportunities. Writing on the subject David Salmon says: [24]

    The imagination of the twentieth century cannot fathom the poverty of
    the eighteenth. The great development of mines and manufactures, which
    has brought ease and independence within the reach of industrious
    labour everywhere, had hardly begun; employment was so scarce and
    intermittent, and wages were so low, that the working classes lived in
    hovels, dressed in rags, and were familiar with the pangs of hunger;
    while those who were forced to look to the rates for hovels, rags, and
    food sufficient to maintain a miserable life numbered a sixth of the
    whole population.

In the towns children were apprenticed out early in life, and for long
hours of daily labor. Child welfare was almost entirely neglected,
children were cuffed about and beaten at their work, juvenile delinquency
was a common condition, child mortality was heavy, and ignorance was the
rule. Schools generally were pay institutions or a charity, and not a
birthright, and usually existed only for the middle and lower-middle
classes in the population who were attendants at the churches and could
afford to pay a little for the schooling given. Reading and religion were
usually the only free subjects. Only in the New England Colonies, where
the beginnings of town and colony school systems were evident, and in a
few of the German States where state control was beginning to be
exercised, was a better condition to be found.

[Illustration: FIG. 143. CHILDREN AS MINIATURE ADULTS
Children leaving school, from an eighteenth-century drawing by Saint
Aubin.]

Among the middle and upper social classes, particularly on the continent
of Europe, a stiff artificiality everywhere prevailed. Children were
dressed and treated as miniature adults, the normal activities of
childhood were suppressed, and the natural interests and emotions of
children found little opportunity for expression. Wearing powdered and
braided hair, long gold-braided coats, embroidered waistcoats, cockaded
hats, and swords, boys were treated more as adults than as children.
Girls, too, with their long dresses, hoops, powdered hair, rouged faces,
and demure manner, were trained in a, for children, most unnatural manner.
[25]

The dancing master for their manners and graces, and the religious
instructor to develop in them the ability to read and to go through a
largely meaningless ceremonial, were the chief guides for the period of
their childhood.

SCHOOL SUPPORT. No uniform plan, in any country, had as yet been evolved
for even the meager support which the schools of the time received. The
Latin grammar schools were in nearly all cases supported by the income
from old "foundations" and from students' fees, with here and there some
state aid. The new elementary vernacular schools, though, had had assigned
to them few old foundations upon which to draw for maintenance, and in
consequence support for elementary schools had to be built up from new
sources, and this required time.

In England the Act of Conformity of 1662 (R. 166), it will be remembered
(p. 324), had laid a heavy hand on the schools by driving all Dissenters
from positions in them, and the Five Mile Act of 1665 had borne even more
severely on the teachers in the schools of the Dissenters. Fortunately for
elementary education in England, however, the English courts, in 1670, had
decided in a test case that the teacher in an elementary school could not
be deprived of his position by failure of the bishop to license him, if he
were a nominee of the founder or the lay patron of the school. The result
of this decision was that, between 1660 and 1730, 905 endowed elementary
schools were founded in England, and 72 others previously founded had
their endowments increased. The number continued to increase throughout
the eighteenth century, and by 1842 had reached a total of 2194. These new
foundations probably gave the best schooling of the time, and tended to
stir the Established Church to action. Accordingly we find that during the
eighteenth century the vestries of the different church parishes began the
creation of parish elementary schools for the children of the poor of the
parish, supporting a teacher for them out of the parish rates, and without
specific legal authorization to do so. These new parish schools also
contributed somewhat to the provision of elementary education, and mark
the beginning of the church "voluntary schools" which were such a
characteristic feature of nineteenth-century English education. We thus
have, in England, endowed elementary schools, parish schools, dame
schools, private-adventure schools of many types, and charity-schools, all
existing side by side, and drawing such support as they could from
endowment funds, parish rates, church tithes, subscriptions, and tuition
fees. The support of schools by subscription lists (R. 240) was a very
common proceeding. Education in England, more than in any other Protestant
land, early came to be regarded as a benevolence which the State was under
no obligation to support. Only workhouse schools were provided for by the
general taxation of all property.

In the Netherlands and in German lands church funds, town funds, and
tuition fees were the chief means of support, though here and there some
prince had provided for something approaching state support for the
schools of his little principality. Frederick the Great had ordered
schools established generally (1763) and had decreed the compulsory
attendance of children (R. 274), but he had depended largely on church
funds and tuition fees (§7) for maintenance, with a proviso that the
tuition of poor and orphaned children should be paid from "any funds of
the church or town, that the schoolmaster may get his income" (§8). In
Scotland the church parish school was the prevailing type. In France the
religious societies (p. 345) provided nearly all the elementary vernacular
religious education that was obtainable.

In the Dutch Provinces, in the New England Colonies, and in some of the
minor German States, we find the clearest examples of the beginnings of
state control and maintenance of elementary schools--something destined to
grow rapidly and in the nineteenth century take over the school from the
Church and maintain it as a function of the State. The Prussian kings
early made grants of land and money for endowment funds and support, and
state aid was ordered granted by Maria Theresa for Austria (R. 274 a), in
1774. In the New England Colonies the separation of the school from the
Church, and the beginnings of state support and control of education,
found perhaps their earliest and clearest exemplification. In the other
Colonies the lottery was much used (R. 246) to raise funds for schools,
while church tithes, subscription lists, and school societies after the
English pattern also helped in many places to start and support a school
or schools.

Only by some such means was it possible in the eighteenth century that the
children of the poor could ever enjoy any opportunities for education. The
parents of the poor children, themselves uneducated, could hardly be
expected to provide what they had never come to appreciate themselves. On
the other hand, few of the well-to-do classes felt under any obligation to
provide education for children not their own. There was as yet no
realization that the diffusion of education contributed to the welfare of
the State, or that the ignorance of the masses might be in any way a
public peril. This attitude is well shown for England by the fact that not
a single law relating to the education of the people, aside from workhouse
schools, was enacted by Parliament during the whole of the eighteenth
century. The same was true of France until the coming of the Revolution.
It is to a few of the German States and to the American Colonies that we
must turn for the beginnings of legislation directing school support. This
we shall describe more in detail in later chapters.

THE LATIN SECONDARY SCHOOL. The great progress made in education during
the eighteenth century, nevertheless, was in elementary education.
Concerning the secondary schools and the universities there is little to
add to what has previously been said. During this century the secondary
school, outside of German lands, remained largely stationary. Having
become formal and lifeless in its teaching (p. 283), and in England and
France crushed by religious-uniformity legislation, the Latin grammar
school of England and the surviving colleges in France practically ceased
to exert any influence on the national life. The Jesuit schools, which
once had afforded the best secondary education in Europe, had so declined
in usefulness everywhere that they were about to be driven from all lands.
The Act of Conformity of 1662 (R. 166) had dealt the grammar schools of
England a heavy blow, and the eighteenth century found them in a most
wretched condition, with few scholars, and their endowments shamefully
abused. The Law of 1662, says Montmorency, "involved such a peering into
the lives of schoolmasters, such a course of inquisitorial folly, that the
position became intolerable. Men would not become schoolmasters....
Education had no meaning when none but political and religious hypocrites
were allowed to teach.... National education was destroyed." and the
grammar schools of England were "practically withdrawn during more than
two centuries (1662-1870) from the national life." [26]

In German lands the old Latin schools continued largely unchanged until
near the middle of the eighteenth century, with Latin, taught as it had
been for a century or more, as the chief subject of study. Shortly after
the coming of Frederick the Great to the throne (1740) the Latin schools
of Prussia, and after them the Latin schools in other German States, were
reorganized and given a new life. The influence of Francke's school at
Halle (p. 418), and the new types of teaching developed there and by his
followers elsewhere, began to be felt. German, French, and mathematics
were given recognition, and some science work was here and there
introduced. Above all, though, Greek now attained to the place of first
importance in the reorganized Latin schools.

It was not until after 1740 that the German people awakened to the
possibility of an independent national life. Then, under the new impulse
toward nationality, French influence and manners were thrown off, German
literature attained its Golden Age, the _Ritterakademieen_ (p. 405) were
discarded, and a number of the German Principalities and States revised
their school regulations and erected, out of the old Latin schools, a
series of humanistic _gymnasia_ in which the study of Greek life and
culture occupied the foremost place. New methods in classical study were
thought out and applied, and a new pedagogical purpose--culture and
discipline--was given to the regenerated Latin schools. A new Renaissance,
in a way, took place in German lands, [27] and a knowledge of Greek was
proclaimed by German university and gymnasial teachers as indispensable to
a liberal education with an earnestness of conviction not exceeded by
Battista Guarino (p. 268) four centuries before. To know Greek and to have
some familiarity with Greek literature and history now came to be regarded
as necessary to the highest culture, [28] and a pedagogical theory for
such study was erected, based on the discipline of the mind, [29] which
dominated the German classical school throughout the entire nineteenth
century. It was in the eighteenth century also that the German States
began the development of the scientific secondary school (_Realschule_),
see p. 420, as described in a preceding chapter.

[Illustration: FIG. 144. A PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY

Church, in 1787.]

RISE OF THE ACADEMY IN AMERICA.  As we have seen (p. 361), the English
Latin grammar school was early (1635) carried to New England, and set up
there and elsewhere in the Colonies, but after the close of the
seventeenth century its continued maintenance was something of a struggle.
Particularly in the central and southern colonies, where commercial
demands early made themselves felt, the tendency was to teach more
practical subjects. This tendency led to the evolution, about the middle
of the eighteenth century, of the distinctively American Academy, with a
more practical curriculum, and by the close of the century it was rapidly
superseding the older Latin grammar school. Franklin's Academy at
Philadelphia, which began instruction in 1751, and which later evolved
into the University of Pennsylvania, was probably the first American
Academy. The first in Massachusetts was founded in 1761, and by 1800 there
were seventeen in Massachusetts alone. The great period of academy
development was the first half of the nineteenth century. The Phillips
Academy, at Andover, Massachusetts, founded in 1788, reveals clearly the
newer purpose of these American secondary schools. The foundation grant of
this school gives the purpose to be:

    to lay the foundation of a public free school or ACADEMY for the
    purposes of instructing Youth, not only in English and Latin Grammar,
    Writing, Arithmetic, and those Sciences wherein they are commonly
    taught; but more especially to learn them the GREAT END AND REAL
    BUSINESS OF LIVING ... it is again declared that the _first_ and
    _principle_ object of this Institution is the promotion of TRUE
    PIETY and VIRTUE; the _second_, instruction in the English,
    Latin, and Greek Languages, together with Writing, Arithmetic, Music,
    and the Art of Speaking; the _third_, practical Geometry,
    Logic, and Geography; and the _fourth_, such other liberal Arts
    and Sciences or Languages, as opportunity and ability may hereafter
    admit, and as the TRUSTEES shall direct.

Though still deeply religious, these new schools usually were free from
denominationalism. Though retaining the study of Latin, they made most of
new subjects of more practical value. A study of real things rather than
words about things, and a new emphasis on native English and on science
were prominent features of their work. They were also usually open to
girls, as well as boys,--an innovation in secondary education before
almost wholly unknown. Many were organized later for girls only. These
institutions were the precursors of the American public high school,
itself a type of the most democratic institution for secondary education
the world has ever known.

THE UNIVERSITIES. The condition of the universities by the middle of the
eighteenth century we traced in the preceding chapter. They had lost their
earlier importance as institutions of learning, but in a few places the
sciences were slowly gaining a foothold, and in German lands we noted the
appearance of the first two modern universities--institutions destined
deeply to influence subsequent university development, as we shall point
out in a later chapter.

END OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD. We have now reached, in our study of the
history of educational progress, the end of the transition period which
marked the change in thinking from mediaeval to modern attitudes. The
period was ushered in with the beginnings of the Revival of Learning in
Italy in the fourteenth century, and it may fittingly close about the
middle of the eighteenth.

We now stand on the threshold of a new era in world history. The same
questioning spirit that animated the scholars of the Revival of Learning,
now full-grown and become bold and self-confident, is about to be applied
to affairs of politics and government, and we are soon to see absolutism
and mediaeval attitudes in both Church and State questioned and
overthrown. New political theories are to be advanced, and the divine
right of the people is to be asserted and established in England, the
American Colonies, and in France, and ultimately, early in the twentieth
century, we are to witness the final overthrow of the divine-right-of-
kings idea and a world-wide sweep of the democratic spirit. A new human
and political theory as to education is to be evolved; the school is to be
taken over from the Church, vastly expanded in scope, and made a
constructive instrument of the State; and the wonderful nineteenth century
is to witness a degree of human, scientific, political, and educational
progress not seen before in all the days from the time of the Crusades to
the opening of the nineteenth century. It is to this wonderful new era in
world history that we now turn.

CHAPTER XIX

THE EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY


THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY A TURNING-POINT. The eighteenth century, in human
thinking and progress, marks for most western nations the end of
mediaevalism and the ushering-in of modern forms of intellectual liberty.
The indifference to the old religious problems, which was clearly manifest
in all countries at the beginning of the century, steadily grew and
culminated in a revolt against ecclesiastical control over human affairs.
This change in attitude toward the old problems permitted the rise of new
types of intellectual inquiry, a rapid development of scientific thinking
and discovery, the growth of a consciousness of national problems and
national welfare, and the bringing to the front of secular interests to a
degree practically unknown since the days of ancient Rome. In a sense the
general rise of these new interests in the eighteenth century was but a
culmination of a long series of movements looking toward greater
intellectual freedom and needed human progress which had been under way
since the days when _studia generalia_ and guilds first arose in western
Europe. The rise of the universities in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, the Revival of Learning in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, the Protestant Revolts in the sixteenth, the rise of modern
scientific inquiry in the sixteenth and seventeenth, and Puritanism in
England and Pietism in Germany in the seventeenth, had all been in the
nature of protests against the mediaeval tendency to confine and limit and
enslave the intellect. In the eighteenth century the culmination of this
rising tide of protest came in a general and determined revolt against
despotism in either Church or State, which, at the close of the century,
swept away ancient privileges, abuses, and barriers, and prepared the way
for the marked intellectual and human and political progress which
characterized the nineteenth century.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGE IN ATTITUDE. The new spirit and interests and
attitudes which came to characterize the eighteenth century in the more
progressive western nations meant the ultimate overthrow of the tyranny of
mediaeval supernatural theology, the evolution of a new theory as to moral
action which should be independent of theology, the freeing of the new
scientific spirit from the fetters of church control, the substituting of
new philosophical and scientific and economic interests for the old
theological problems which had for so long dominated human thinking, the
substitution of natural political organization for the older
ecclesiastical foundations of the State, the destruction of what remained
of the old feudal political system, the freeing of the serf and the
evolution of the citizen, and the rise of a modern society interested in
problems of national welfare--government in the interest of the governed,
commerce, industry, science, economics, education, and social welfare. The
evolution of such modern-type governments inevitably meant the creation of
entirely new demands for the education of the people and for far-reaching
political and social reforms.

This new eighteenth-century spirit, which so characterized the mid-
eighteenth century that it is often spoken of as the "Period of the
Enlightenment," [1] expressed itself in many new directions, a few of the
more important of which will be considered here as of fundamental concern
for the student of the history of educational progress. In a very real
sense the development of state educational systems, in both European and
American States, has been an outgrowth of the great liberalizing forces
which first made themselves felt in a really determined way during this
important transition century. In this chapter we shall consider briefly
five important phases of this new eighteenth-century liberalism, as
follows:

    1. The work of the benevolent despots of continental Europe in trying
       to shape their governments to harmonize them with the new spirit of
       the century.

    2. The unsatisfied demand for reform in France.

    3. The rise of democratic government and liberalism in England.

    4. The institution of constitutional government and religious freedom
       in America.

    5. The sweeping away of mediaeval abuses in the great Revolution in
       France.


I. WORK OF THE BENEVOLENT DESPOTS OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE

THE NEW NATIONALISM LEADS TO INTERESTED GOVERNMENT. In England, as we
shall trace a little further on, a democratic form of government had for
long been developing, but this democratic life had made but little headway
on the continent of Europe. There, instead, the democratic tendencies
which showed some slight signs of development during the sixteenth century
had been stamped out in the period of warfare and the ensuing hatreds of
the seventeenth, and in the eighteenth century we find autocratic
government at its height. National governments to succeed the earlier
government of the Church had developed and grown strong, the kingly power
had everywhere been consolidated, Church and State were in close working
alliance, and the new spirit of nationality--in government, foreign
policy, languages, literature, and culture--was being energetically
developed by those responsible for the welfare of the States. Everywhere,
almost, on the continent of Europe, the theory of the divine right of
kings to rule and the divine duty of subjects to obey seemed to have
become fixed, and this theory of government the Church now most
assiduously supported. Unlike in England and the American Colonies, the
people of the larger countries of continental Europe had not as yet
advanced far enough in personal liberty or political thinking to make any
demand of consequence for the right to govern themselves. The new spirit
of nationality abroad in Europe, though, as well as the new humanitarian
ideas beginning to stir thinking men, alike tended to awaken a new
interest on the part of many rulers in the welfare of the people they
governed. In consequence, during the eighteenth century, we find a number
of nations in which the rulers, putting themselves in harmony with the new
spirit of the time, made earnest attempts to improve the condition of
their peoples as a means of advancing the national welfare. We shall here
mention the four nations in which the most conspicuous reform work was
attempted.

THE RULERS OF PRUSSIA. Three kings, to whom the nineteenth-century
greatness of Prussia was largely due, ruled the country during nearly the
whole of the eighteenth century. They were fully as despotic as the kings
of France, but, unlike the French kings, they were keenly alive to the
needs of the people, anxious to advance the welfare of the State, tolerant
in religion, and in sympathy with the new scientific studies. The first,
Frederick William I (1713-40), labored earnestly to develop the resources
of the country, trained a large army, ordered elementary education made
compulsory, and made the beginnings in the royal provinces of the
transformation of the schools from the control of the Church to the
control of the State. His son, known to history as Frederick the Great,
ruled from 1740 to 1786. During his long reign he labored continually to
curtail ancient privileges, abolish old abuses, and improve the condition
of his people. During the first week of his reign he abolished torture in
trials, made the administration of law more equitable, instituted a
limited freedom for the press, [2] and extended religious toleration. [3]
He also partially abolished serfdom on the royal domains, and tried to
uplift the peasantry and citizen classes, but in this he met with bitter
opposition from the nobles of his realm. He built roads, canals, and
bridges, encouraged skilled artisans to settle in his dominions, developed
agriculture and industry, encouraged scientific workers, extended an
asylum to thousands of Huguenots fleeing from religious persecution in
France, [4] and did more than any previous ruler to provide common schools
throughout his kingdom. By the general regulation of education in his
kingdom (chapter xxii) he laid the foundations upon which the nineteenth-
century Prussian school system was later built.

[Illustration: Fig 145 FREDERICK THE GREAT]

His rule, though, was thoroughly autocratic. "Every thing for the people,
but nothing by the people", was the keynote of his policies. He had no
confidence in the ability of the people to rule, and gave them no
opportunity to learn the art. He employed the strong army his father built
up to wage wars of conquest, seize territory that did not belong to him,
and in consequence made himself a great German hero. [5] He may be said to
have laid the foundations of modern militarized, socialized, obediently
educated, and subject Germany, and also to have begun the "grand-larceny"
and "scrap-of-paper" policy which has characterized Prussian international
relationships ever since. Frederick William II, who reigned from 1786 to
1797, continued in large measure the enlightened policies of his uncle,
reformed the tax system, lightened the burdens of his people, encouraged
trade, emphasized the German tongue, quickened the national spirit,
actively encouraged schools and universities, and began that
centralization of authority over the developing educational system which
resulted in the creation in Prussia of the first modern state school
system in Europe. The educational work of these three Prussian kings was
indeed important, and we shall study it more in detail in a later chapter
(Chapter XXII).

THE AUSTRIAN REFORMERS. Two notably benevolent rulers occupied the
Austrian throne for half a century, and did much to improve the condition
of the Austrian people. A very remarkable woman, Maria Theresa, came to
the throne in 1740, and was followed by her son, Joseph II, in 1780. He
ruled until 1790. To Maria Theresa the Austria of the nineteenth century
owed most of its development and power. She worked with seemingly tireless
energy for the advancement of the welfare of her subjects, and toward the
close of her reign laid, as we shall see in a later chapter, the
beginnings of Austrian school reform.

Joseph II carried still further his mother's benevolent work, and strove
to introduce "enlightenment and reason" into the administration of his
realm. A student of the writings of the eighteenth-century reform
philosophers, and deeply imbued with the reform spirit of his time, he
attempted to abolish ancient privileges, establish a uniform code of
justice, encourage education, free the serfs, abolish feudal tenure, grant
religious toleration, curb the power of the Pope and the Church, break the
power of the local Diets, centralize the State, and "introduce a uniform
level of democratic simplicity under his own absolute sway." He attempted
to alter the organization of the Church, abolished six hundred
monasteries, [6] and reduced the number of monastic persons in his
dominion from 63,000 to 27,000. Attempting too much, he brought down upon
his head the wrath of both priest and noble and died a disappointed man.
The abolition of feudal tenure and serfdom on the distinctively Austrian
lands, of all his attempted reforms, alone was permanent. His work stands
as an interesting commentary on the temporary character of the results
which follow attempts rapidly to improve the conditions surrounding the
lives of people, without at the same time educating the people to improve
themselves.

THE SPANISH REFORMERS. A very similar result attended the reform efforts
of a succession of benevolent rulers thrust upon Spain, during the
eighteenth century, by the complications of foreign politics. Over a
period of nearly ninety years, extending from the accession of Philip V
(1700) to the death of Charles III (1788), remarkable political progress
was imposed by a succession of able ministers and with the consent of the
kings. [7] The power of the Church, always the crying evil of Spain, was
restricted in many ways; the Inquisition was curbed; the Jesuits were
driven from the kingdom; the burning of heretics was stopped; prosecution
for heresy was reduced and discouraged; the monastic orders were taught to
fear the law and curb their passions; evils in public administration were
removed; national grievances were redressed; the civil service was
improved; science and literature were encouraged, in place of barren
theological speculations; and an earnest effort was made to regenerate the
national life and improve the lot of the common people.

All these reforms, though, were imposed from above, and no attempt was
made to introduce schools or to educate the people in the arts of self-
government. The result was that the reforms never went beneath the
surface, and the national life of the people remained largely untouched.
Within five years of the death of Charles III all had been lost.  Under a
native Spanish king, thoroughly orthodox, devout, and lacking in any broad
national outlook, the Church easily restored itself to power, the priests
resumed their earlier importance, the nobles again began to exact their
full toll, free discussion was forbidden, scientific studies were
abandoned, the universities were ordered to discontinue the study of moral
philosophy, and the political and social reforms which had required three
generations to build up were lost in half a decade. Not meeting any well-
expressed need of the people, and with no schools provided to show to the
people the desirable nature of the reforms introduced, it was easy to
sweep them aside.  In this relapse to mediaevalism, the chance for Spain--
a country rich in possibilities and natural resources--to evolve early
into a progressive modern  nation was lost.  So Spain has remained ever
since, and only in the last quarter of a century has reform from within
begun to be evident in this until recently priest-ridden and benighted
land.

THE INTELLIGENT DESPOTS OF RUSSIA. The greatest of these were Peter the
Great, who ruled from 1689 to 1725, and Catherine II, who ruled from 1762
to 1796. Catching something of the new eighteenth-century western spirit,
these rulers tried to introduce some western enlightenment into their as
yet almost barbarous land. Each tried earnestly to lift their people to a
higher level of living, and to start them on the road toward civilization
and learning. By a series of edicts, despotically enforced, Peter tried to
introduce the civilization of the western world into his country. He
brought in numbers of skilled artisans, doctors, merchants, teachers,
printers, and soldiers; introduced many western skills and trades; and
made the beginnings of western secondary education for the governing
classes by the establishment in the cities of a number of German-type
_gymnasia_. [8] Later Catherine II had the French philosopher Diderot (p.
482) draw up a plan for her for the organization of a state system of
higher schools, but the plan was never put into effect. The beginnings of
Russian higher civilization really date from this eighteenth-century work.
The power of the formidable Greek or Eastern Church remained, however,
untouched, and this continued, until after the Russian revolution of 1917,
as one of the most serious obstacles to Russian intellectual and
educational progress. The serfs, too, remained serfs--tied to the land,
ignorant, superstitious, and obedient.

By the close of the eighteenth century Russia, largely under Prussian
training, had become a very formidable military power, and by the close of
the nineteenth century was beginning to make some progress of importance
in the arts of peace. Just at present Russia is going through a stage of
national evolution quite comparable to that which took place in France a
century and a quarter ago, and the educational importance of this great
people, as we shall point out further on, lies in their future evolution
rather than in any contribution they have as yet made to western
development.


II. THE UNSATISFIED DEMAND FOR REFORM IN FRANCE

THE SETTING OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE. Eighteenth-century France, on
the contrary, developed no benevolent despot to mitigate abuses, reform
the laws, abolish privileges, temper the rule of the Church, [9] (R. 247),
curb the monastic orders, develop the natural resources, begin the
establishment of schools, and alleviate the hard lot of the serf and the
peasant. There, instead, absolute monarchy in Europe reached its most
complete triumph during the long reigns of Louis XIV (1643-1715) and Louis
XV (1715-74), and the splendor of the court life of France captivated all
Europe and served to hide the misery which made the splendor possible.
There the power of the nobles had been completely broken, and the power of
the parliaments completely destroyed. "I am the State," exclaimed Louis
XIV, and the almost unlimited despotism of the King and his ministers and
favorites fully supported the statement. Local liberties had been
suppressed, and the lot of the common people--ignorant, hard-working,
downtrodden, but intensely patriotic--was wretched in the extreme.
Approximately 140,000 nobles [10] and 130,000 monks, nuns, and clergy
owned two fifths of the landed property of France, and controlled the
destinies of a nation of approximately 25,000,000 people. Agriculture was
the great industry of the time, but this was so taxed by the agents of
King and Church that over one half of the net profits from farming were
taken for taxation.

CHURCH AND STATE WERE IN CLOSE WORKING ALLIANCE. The higher offices of the
Church were commonly held by appointed noblemen, who drew large incomes
[11] led worldly lives, and neglected their priestly functions much as the
Italian appointees in German lands had done before the Reformation.
Between the nobles and upper clergy on the one hand and the peasant-born
lower clergy and the masses of the people on the other a great gulf
existed. The real brains of France were to be found among a small
bourgeois class of bankers, merchants, shopkeepers, minor officials,
lawyers, and skilled artisans, who lived in the cities and who, ambitious
and discontented, did much to stimulate the increasing unrest and demand
for reform which in time pervaded the whole nation. A king, constantly in
need of increasing sums of money; an idle, selfish, corrupt, and
discredited nobility and upper clergy, incapable of aiding the king, many
of whom, too, had been influenced by the new philosophic and scientific
thinking and were willing to help destroy their own orders; an aggressive,
discontented, and patriotic bourgeoisie, full of new political and social
ideas, and patriotically anxious to reform France; and a vast unorganized
peasantry and city rabble, suffering much and resisting little, but
capable of a terrible fury and senseless destruction, once they were
aroused and their suppressed rage let loose;--these were the main elements
in the setting of eighteenth-century France.

So many French _litterateurs_ give me the idea that they don't go
nearer the Greek authors than the Latin translations. . . .
Sainte Beuve [_Nouveaux Lundis_, vii. 1--52, on 'The Greek Anthology']
is an enthusiastic champion for our side, but, oddly enough, he never
strikes me as knowing much about the matter!"
"Your Latin verses [translating Cowley] I greatly enjoy. The dear old Abraham
goes straight off into your beautiful lines. Of course he has not a scrap
of modern _impedimenta_. You go through the customs at the frontier with
a whistle and a smile. You have _nothing to declare_. The blessed old man
by your side is himself a Roman to begin with, and you pass together as
cheerfully as possible. . . ."
"I have also been reading Karl Elze's _Essays on Shakespeare_.

He is not bad, but don't you resent the imperturbable confidence
of men who, after attributing a play of Shakespeare's to two authors,
proceed to suggest a third, urged thereto by some fatuous and
self-sought exigency?"

"Did you ever try to write a Burns song? I mean the equivalent in ordinary
English of his Scotch. Can it be done? A Yorkshireman-- could he
do it? A Lancashire man (Waugh)? I hardly think so.
The Ayrshire dialect has a _Schwung_ and a confidence that no-English
county can pretend to. Our dialects are apologetic things, half-ashamed,
half-insolent. Burns has no doubts, and for his audience unhesitatingly
demands the universe. . . ."
"There is an ethos in Fitzgerald's letters which is so exquisitely idyllic
as to be almost heavenly. He takes you with him, exactly accommodating
his pace to yours, walks through meadows so tranquil, and yet
abounding in the most delicate surprises.

And these surprises seem so familiar, just as if they had originated with
yourself. What delicious blending! What a perfect interweft of thought and
diction! What a _sweet_ companion!"
Lastly, let me quote a passage in which his thoughts return to
Clifton, where it had been suggested that Greek should be omitted from the
ordinary form-routine and taught in "sets," or separate classes:--
"This is disturbing about Greek, 'set' Greek. Yes, you would fill
your school to overflowing, of course you would, so long as other places
did not abandon the old lines.

But it would be detestable treachery to the cause of education, of
humanity.

To me the _learning_ of any blessed thing is a matter of little
moment.

Greek is not learned by nineteen-twentieths of our Public School boys.
But it is a baptism into a cult, a faith, not more irrational than
other faiths or cults; the baptism of a regeneration which releases us
from I know not what original sin.

    And if a man does not see that, he is a fool, such a fool that I
shouldn't wonder if he gravely asked me to explain what I meant by
original sin in such a connection. . . ."

    So his thoughts reverted to the school he had left in 1892.

    In October, 1897, he returned to it on a visit.

    He was the guest of one of the house masters, Mr.

    Tait, and on Friday evening, October 29th, gave an address to the
boys of the house.

    He had spoken for some minutes with brightness and vigour, when his
voice grew thick and he was seen to stagger.

    He died in less than two hours.

    

    His letters have been collected and piously given to the world by Mr.

    Irwin, one of his closest friends. By far the greatest number of them
       belong to those last five years in the Island--the happiest,
perhaps, of his life, certainly the happiest temperamentally.

"Never the time and the place . . ." but at least Brown was more fortunate
than most men.
He realised his dream, and it did not disappoint him. He could not carry
off his friends to share it (and it belongs to criticism of these
volumes to say that he was exceptionally happy in his friends), but
he could return and visit them or stay at home and write to them
concerning the realisation, and be sure they understood.

Therefore, although we desire more letters of the Clifton period--although
twenty years are omitted, left blank to us--those that survive confirm a
fame which, although never wide, was always unquestioned within its range.
There could be no possibility of doubt concerning Brown. He was absolute.
He lived a fierce, shy, spiritual life; a wise man, keeping the child in
his heart:
he loved much and desired permanence in the love of his kind.
"Diuturnity," says his great seventeenth-century namesake, "is a dream and
folly of expectation. There is nothing strictly immortal but
immortality." And yet, _prosit amasse!_
The railway took me on to Oxford--
"Like faithful hound returning For old sake's sake to each loved track
With heart and memory burning."
"I well remember," writes Mrs. Green of her husband, the late John Richard
Green, "the passionate enthusiasm with which he watched from the train
for the first sight of the Oxford towers against the sky:" and although
our enthusiasm nowadays has to feed on a far tamer view than that which
saluted our forefathers when the stage-coach topped the rise of
Shotover and its passengers beheld the city spread at their feet, yet what
faithful son of Oxford can see her towers rise above the water-meadows
and re-greet them without a thrill?

In the year 1688, and in a book entitled _The Guardian's Instruction_, a
Mr.

Stephen Penton gave the world a pleasing and lifelike little
narrative--superior, in my opinion, to anything in _Verdant Green_--
telling us how a reluctant father was persuaded to send his son to
Oxford; what doubts, misgivings, hesitations he had, and how they
were overcome.

I take the story to be fictitious. It is written in the first person,
professedly by the hesitating parent: but the parent can hardly have
been Penton, for the story will not square with what we know of his
life.
The actual Penton was born, it seems, in 1640, and educated at Winchester
and New College; proceeded to his fellowship, resided from 1659 to 1670,
and was Principal of St. Edmund's Hall from 1675 to 1683. He appears to
have been chaplain to the Earl of Aylesbury, and, according to Antony
a Wood, possessed a "rambling head." He died in 1706.

The writer in _The Guardian's Instruction_ is portrayed for us--or is
allowed to portray himself--rather as an honest country squire,
who had himself spent a year or so of his youth at the University,
but had withdrawn when Oxford was invaded by the Court and the
trouble between King Charles and Parliament came to a head: and
"God's grace, the Good example of my parents, and a natural love
of virtue secured me so far as to leave Oxford, though not much
more learned, yet not much worse than I came thither."

    A chill testimonial! In short, the old squire (as I will take
    leave to call him) nursed a somewhat crotchety detestation of the
    place, insomuch "that when I came to have children, I did almost
    _swear_ them in their childhood never to be friends with
    Oxford."
    He tried his eldest son with a course of foreign travel as a substitute
    for University training; but this turned out a failure, and he had the
    good sense to acknowledge his mistake. So for his second boy he
    cast about to find a profession; "but what course to take
    I was at a loss:
    Cambridge was so far off, I could not have an eye upon him; Oxford I
    was angry with."
    In this fix he consulted with a neighbour, "an old grave learned
    divine," and rigid Churchman, who confessed that many of the
    charges against Oxford were well grounded, but averred that the
    place was mending. The truth was, the University had been loyal to
    the monarchy all through the Commonwealth times; and when Oliver
Cromwell was dead, and Richard dismounted, its members perceived,
through the maze of changes and intrigues, that in a little time
the heart of the nation would revert to the government which twenty
years before it had hated.

And their impatient hopes of this "made the scholars talk aloud, drink
healths, and curse Meroz in the very streets; insomuch that when the King
came in, they were not only like them that dream, but like them who are
out of their wits, mad, stark, staring mad." This unholy 'rag' (to
modernise the old gentleman's language) continued for a twelvemonth: that
is to say, until the Vice-Chancellor--holding that the demonstration, like
Miss Mary Bennet's pianoforte playing in _Pride and Prejudice_, had
delighted the company long enough--put his foot down. And from that time
the University became sober, modest, and studious as perhaps any in
Europe. The old gentleman wound up with some practical advice, and a
promise to furnish the squire with a letter of recommendation to one of
the best tutors in Oxford.

Thus armed, the squire (though still with misgivings) was not long in getting
on horseback with his wife, his daughters, and his young hopeful, and
riding off to Oxford, where at first it seemed that his worst suspicions
would be confirmed; "for at ten o'clock in the inn, there arose such
a roaring and singing that my hair stood on end, and my former prejudices
were so heightened that I resolved to lose the journey and carry
back my son again, presuming that no noise in Oxford could be made
but _scholars_ must do it,"--a hoary misconception still cherished,
or until recently, by the Metropolitan Police and the Oxford City
Bench.

In this instance a proctor intervened, and quelled the disturbance by sending
'two young pert townsmen' to prison; "and quickly came to my chamber, and
perceiving my boy designed for a gown, told me that it was for the
preservation of such fine youths as he that the proctors made so bold
with gentlemen's lodgings." The squire had some talk with this dignitary,
who was a man of presence and suitable address, and of sufficient
independence to deny--not for the first time in history--that
dons were overpaid.

Next morning the whole family trooped off to call upon the tutor whom
their old neighbour had recommended. Oddly enough, the tutor
seemed by no means overwhelmed by the honour. "I thought to have
found him mightily pleased with the opinion we had of his conduct, and
the credit of having a gentleman's son under his charge, and the father
with cap in hand.
Instead of all this he talked at a rate as if the gentry were _obliged_ to
tutors more than tutors to them." The tutor, in short, was decidedly
tart in his admonitions to this honest family--he did not forget,
either, to assure them that (_generally_) a college tutor was worse paid
than a dancing-master.

Here is a specimen of his advice--sound and practical enough in its
way:--
"I understand by one of your daughters that you have brought him up a _fine
padd_ to keep here for his health's sake. Now I will tell you
the use of an horse in Oxford, and then do as you think fit.
The horse must be kept at an _ale-house_ or an _inn_, and he must have
leave to go once _every day_ to see him eat oats, because the master's
eye makes him fat; and it will not be genteel to go often to an house
and spend nothing; and then there may be some danger of the horse
growing _resty_ if he be not used often, so you must give him leave to go
to _Abingdon_ once every week, to look out of the tavern window and see
the maids sell turnips; and in one month or two come home with a surfeit
of poisoned wine, and save _any farther trouble_ by dying, and then
you will be troubled to send for your horse _again_. . . ."

The humour of college tutors has not greatly altered in two hundred years.

I have known one or two capable of the sardonic touch in those concluding
words. But conceive its effect upon the squire's lady and daughters!

No: you need not trouble to do so, for the squire describes it: "When
the tutor was gone out of the room, I asked how they liked the person
and his converse. My boy clung about his mother and cry'd to go home again,
and she had no more wit than to be of the same mind; she thought him too
weakly to undergo so much hardship as she foresaw was to be
expected.
My daughter, who (instead of catechism and _Lady's Calling_) had been used
to read nothing but speeches in romances, and hearing nothing of _Love_
and _Honour_ in all the talk, fell into downright _scolding_ at
him; call'd him the _merest_ scholar; and if this were your _Oxford_
breeding, they had rather he should go to _Constantinople_ to learn
manners!

But I, who was older and understood the language, call'd them all great
fools. . . ."
On the tutor's return they begged to have his company at dinner, at their
inn: but he declined, kept the young man to dine with him, and next day
invited the family to luncheon. They accepted, fully expecting (after the
austerity of his discourse) to be starved: "and the girles drank chocolette
at no rate in the morning, for fear of the _worst_." But they were by
no means starved. "It was very pleasant," the squire confesses, "to see,
when we came, the _constrain'd_ artifice of an unaccustomed
complement."

There were silver tankards 'heaped upon one another,' 'napkins some twenty
years younger than the rest,' and glasses 'fit for a _Dutchman_ at an
_East-India Return_.' The dinner was full enough for ten. "I was asham'd,
but would not disoblige him, considering with myself that I should
put this man to such a charge of forty shillings at least, to entertain
me; when for all his honest care and pains he is to have but forty or
fifty shillings a quarter; so that for one whole quarter he must doe
the drudgery to my son for nothing." After dinner, our good squire
strolled off to a public bowling-green, "that being the onely
recreation I can affect." And "coming in, I saw half a score of
the finest youths the sun, I think, ever shined upon.

They walked to and fro, with their hands in their pockets, to see a
match played by some scholars and some gentlemen fam'd for their skill.
I gaped also and stared as a man in his way would doe; but a country ruff
gentleman, being like to _lose_, did swear, at such a rate that my heart
did grieve that those fine young men should _hear_ it, and know there
was such a thing as swearing in the kingdom. Coming to my lodging, I charged
my son never to go to such publick places unless he resolved to quarrel
with me."
And so, having settled the lad and fitted him up with good advice,
the father, mother, and sisters returned home.

But the squire, being summoned to Oxford shortly after to "sit in
_parliament_" (presumably in the last Parliament held at Oxford,
in March, 1681), took that opportunity to walk the streets and study
the demeanour of the "scholars."

And this experiment would seem to have finally satisfied him. "I walk'd the
streets as late as most people, and never in ten days ever saw any scholar
rude or disordered: so that as I grow old, and more engaged to speak the
_truth_, I do repent of the _ill-opinion_ I have had of that place, and
hope to be farther obliged by a very good _account_ of my son."
Old Stephen Penton may have had a rambling head; but unless I have thumbed
the bloom off his narrative in my attempt to summarise it, the
reader will allow that he knew how to write.
So important was this charter to such a liberty-loving people as the
English have always been, and so bitterly did kings resent its hampering
provisions, that within the next two centuries kings had been forced to
confirm it no less than thirty-seven times.

By 1295 the first complete Parliament, representative of the three orders
of society--Lords, Clergy, and Commons--assembled, and in 1333 the Commons
gained the right to sit by itself. From that time to the present the
Commons, representing the people, has gradually broadened its powers,
working, as Tennyson has said, [18] "from precedent to precedent," until
to-day it rules the English nation. In 1376 the Commons gained the right
to impeach the King's ministers, and in 1407 the exclusive right to make
grants of money for any governmental purpose. Centuries ahead of other
nations, this insured an almost continual meeting of the national assembly
and a close scrutiny of the acts of both kings and ministers.

In 1604 King James I, imitating continental European precedents,
proclaimed his theory as to the "divine right of kings" to rule, [19] and
a struggle at once set in which carried the English into Civil War (1642-
49); led to the beheading of Charles I (1649); the overthrow and
banishment of James II (1688); and the ultimate firm establishment,
instead, of the "divine right of the common people." [20] In an age when
the autocratic power and the divine right of kings to rule was almost
unquestioned elsewhere in Europe, the English people compelled their king
to recognize that he could rule over them only when he ruled in their
interests and as they wished him to do. Though there was a period of
struggle later on with the German Georges (I, II, and III), and especially
with the honest but stupid George III, England has, since 1688, been a
government of and by the people. [21] France did not rid itself of the
"divine-right" conception until the French Revolution (1789), and Germany,
Austria, and Russia not until 1918.

GROWTH OF TOLERANCE AMONG THE ENGLISH. The results of the long struggle of
the English for liberty under law showed itself in many ways in the growth
of tolerance among the people of the English nation. At a time when other
nations were bound down in blind obedience to king and priest, and when
dissenting minorities were driven from the land, the English people had
become accustomed to the idea of individual liberty, regulated by law, and
to the toleration of opinions with which they did not agree. These
characteristically English conceptions of liberty under law and of the
toleration of minorities have found expression in many important ways in
the life and government of the people (R. 250), and have been elements of
great strength in England's colonial policy. One of the important ways in
which this growth of tolerance among the English showed itself was in the
extension of a larger freedom to those unable to subscribe to the state
religion.

Though the Reformation movement had stirred up bitter hatreds in England,
as on the Continent, the English were among the first of European peoples
to show tolerance of opposition in religious matters. The high English
State Church, which had succeeded the Roman, had made but small appeal to
many Englishmen. The Puritans had early struggled to secure a
simplification of the church service and the introduction of more
preaching (p. 359), and in the seventeenth century the organization of
three additional dissenting sects, which became known as Unitarians,
Baptists, and Quakers, took place. These sects divided off rather quietly,
and their separation resulted only in the enactment of new laws regarding
conformity, prayers, and teaching.

During the latter half of the seventeenth century, after the execution of
Charles I (1649), the Puritans had temporarily risen to power, and during
their control of affairs had imposed their strict Calvinistic standards as
to Sabbath observance and piety on the nation. This was very distasteful
to many, and from such strict observances the people in time rebelled. The
standards of the English in personal morality, temperance, amusements, and
manners at the beginning of the eighteenth century were not especially
high, and in the reaction from Puritan control and strict religious
observances the great mass of the people degenerated into positive
irreligion and gross immorality. Drunkenness, rowdyism, robbery,
blasphemy, brutality, lewdness, and prostitution became very common. This
moral decline of the people the Church of England seemed powerless to
arrest.

[Illustration: FIG. 151. JOHN WESLEY (1707-82)
Founder of Methodism.]

About 1730 a reform movement was begun under the able leadership of a
young Oxford student by the name of John Wesley, ably seconded by George
Whitefield (1714-70), with a view to reaching the classes so completely
untouched by the high State Church. By traveling over the country and
preaching a gospel of repentance, personal faith, and better living, these
two young men made a deep emotional appeal, and soon gained a strong hold
on the poorer and more ignorant classes of the people. Forbidden to preach
in Anglican churches, and at times threatened with personal violence,
these two men were in time forced into open rebellion against the
Established Church. Finally they founded a new Church, which became known
as the Methodist. [22] This new organization bore the same relation to the
Church of England that the Anglican Church two hundred years before had
borne to the Church of Rome. Thus was accomplished a second spiritual
reformation in England, and one destined in time to spread to the colonies
and deeply affect the lives of a large portion of the English people. [23]
That such a well-organized sect could arise, such a moral reformation be
preached, and the power of the Established Church be challenged so openly
and without serious persecution, speaks much for the growth of religious
tolerance among the English people since the days of the great Elizabeth.
In 1778 the Roman Catholic Relief Act was adopted, and in 1779 dissenting
ministers and schoolmasters were relieved from the disabilities under
which they had so long remained. These acts indicate a further marked
growth in religious tolerance on the part of the English nation. [24]

NEW EMANCIPATING AND EDUCATIVE INFLUENCES. In 1662 the first regular
newspaper outside of Italy was established in England, and in 1702 the
first daily paper. Small in size, printed on but one side of the sheet,
and dealing wholly with local matters, these nevertheless marked the
beginnings of that daily expression of popular opinion with which we are
now so familiar. [25] After about 1705 the cheap political pamphlet made
its appearance, and after 1710, instead of merely communicating news, the
papers began the discussion of political questions.

By 1735 a revolution had been effected in England, and papers and presses
began to be established in the chief cities and towns outside of London;
the freedom of the press was in a large way completed, and newspapers, for
the first time in the history of the world, were made the exponents of
public opinion. The press in England in consequence became an educative
force of great intellectual and political importance, and did much to
compensate for the lack of a general system of schools for the people. In
1772 the right to publish the debates in Parliament was finally won, over
the strenuous objections [26] of George III. In 1780 the first Sunday
newspaper appeared, "on the only day the lower orders had time to read a
paper at all," and, despite the efforts of religious bodies to suppress
it, the Sunday paper has continued to the present and has contributed its
quota to the education and enlightenment of mankind. In 1785 the famous
London _Times_ began to appear. In the middle of the eighteenth century
debating societies for the consideration of public questions arose, and in
1769 "the first public meeting ever assembled in England, in which it was
attempted to enlighten Englishmen respecting their political rights" was
held, and such meetings soon became of almost daily occurrence. All these
influences stimulated political thinking to a high degree, and contributed
not only to a desire for still larger political freedom but for the more
general diffusion of the ability to read as well (R. 250).

Still other important new influences arose during the early part of the
eighteenth century, each of which tended to awaken new desires for schools
and learning. In 1678 the first modern printed story to appeal to the
masses, Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_, appeared from the press. Written,
as it had been, by a man of the people, its simple narrative form, its
passionate religious feeling, its picture of the journey of a pilgrim
through a world of sin and temptation and trial, and its Biblical language
with which the common people had now become familiar--all these elements
combined to make it a book that appealed strongly to all who read or heard
it read, and stimulated among the masses a desire to read comparable to
that awakened by the chaining of the English Bible in the churches a
century before (R. 170). In 1719 the first great English novel, Defoe's
_Robinson Crusoe_, and in 1726 _Gulliver's Travels_, added new stimulus to
the desires awakened by Bunyan's book. All three were books of the common
people, whereas the dramas, plays, essays, and scholarly works previously
produced had appealed only to a small educated class. In 1751 what was
probably the first circulating library of modern times was opened at
Birmingham, and soon thereafter similar institutions were established in
other English cities.

SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING; THE NEW ERA. England, too, from the first,
showed an interest in and a tolerance toward the new scientific thinking
scarcely found in any other land. This in itself is indicative of the
great intellectual progress which the English people had by this time
made. [27] At a time when Galileo, in Italy, was fighting, almost alone,
for the right to think along the lines of the new scientific method and
being imprisoned for his pains, Englishmen were reading with deep interest
the epoch-making scientific writings of Lord Francis Bacon, Earlier than
in other lands, too, the Newtonian philosophy found a place in the
instruction of the national universities, and English scholars began to
employ the new scientific method in their search for new truths. The
British Royal (Scientific) Society [28] had begun to meet as early as
1645, and ever since has published in its proceedings the best of English
scientific thinking. By the reign of George I (1714-27) scientific work
began to be popularized, and the first little booklets on scientific
subjects began to appear. These popular presentations of what had been
worked out were sold at the book stalls and by peddlers and were eagerly
read; by the beginning of the reign of George III (1760) they had become
very common. In 1704-10 the first "Dictionary of Arts and Sciences" was
printed, and in 1768-71 the first edition (three volumes) of the now
famous _Encyclopedia Britannica_ appeared. In 1755 the famous British
Museum was founded.

As early as 1698 a rude form of steam engine had been patented in England,
and by 1712 this had been perfected sufficiently to be used in pumping
water from the coal mines. In 1765 James Watt made the real beginning of
the application of steam to industry by patenting his steam engine; in
1760 Wedgwood established the pottery industry in England; in 1767
Hargreaves devised the spinning-jenny, which banished the spindle and
distaff and the old spinning-wheel; in 1769 Arkwright evolved his
spinning-frame; and in 1785 Cartwright completed the process by inventing
the power loom for weaving. In 1784 a great improvement in the smelting of
iron ores (puddling) was worked out. These inventions, all English, were
revolutionary in their effect on manufacturing. They meant the
displacement of hand power by machine labor, the breakdown of home
industry through the concentration of labor in factories, the rise of
great manufacturing cities, [29] and the ultimate collapse of the age-old
apprenticeship system of training, where the master workman with a few
apprentices in his shop prepared goods for sale. They also meant the
ultimate transformation of England from an agricultural into a great
manufacturing and exporting nation, whose manufactured products would be
sold in every corner of the globe.

By 1750 a change in attitude toward all the old intellectual problems had
become marked in England, and by 1775 attention before unknown was being
given there to social, political, economic, and educational questions.
Religious intolerance was dying out, the harsh laws of earlier days had
begun to be modified, new social and political interests [30] were
everywhere attracting attention, and the great commercial expansion of
England was rapidly taking shape. With England and France leading in the
new scientific studies; England in the van in the development of
manufacturing and the French to the fore in social influences and polite
literature; England and the new American Colonies setting new standards in
government by the people; the French theorists and economists giving the
world new ideas as to the function of the State; enlightened despots on
the thrones of Prussia, Austria, Spain, and Russia; and the hatreds of the
hundred years of religious warfare dying out; the world seemed to many,
about 1775, as on the verge of some great and far-reaching change in
methods of living and in government, and about ready to enter a new era
and make rapid advances in nearly all lines of human activity. The change
came, but not in quite the manner expected.


IV. INSTITUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN
AMERICA

[Illustration: FIG. 152. NATIONALITY OF THE WHITE POPULATION, AS SHOWN BY
THE FAMILY NAMES IN THE CENSUS OF 1790.]

ENGLISHMEN IN AMERICA ESTABLISH A REPUBLIC. Though the early settlement of
America, as was pointed out in chapter xv, was made from among those
people and from those lands which had embraced some form of the Protestant
faith, and represented a number of nationalities and several religious
sects, the thirteen colonies, nevertheless, were essentially English in
origin, speech, habits, observances, and political and religious
conceptions. This is well shown for the white population by the results of
the first Federal census, taken in 1790, as given in the adjoining figure.
This shows that of all the people in the thirteen original States, 83.5
per cent possessed names indicating pure English origin, and that 91.8 per
cent had names which pointed to their having come from the British Isles.
The largest non-British name nationality was the German, with 5.6 per cent
of the whole, and these were found chiefly in Pennsylvania where they
constituted 26.1 per cent of the State's population. Next were those
having Dutch names, who constituted but 2 per cent of the total
population, and but 16.1 per cent of the population of New York. No other
name-nationality constituted over one half of one per cent of the total.
The New England States were almost as English as England itself, 93 to 96
per cent of the names being pure English, and 98.5 to 99.8 per cent being
from the British Isles.

We thus see that it was from England, the nation which had done most in
the development of individual and religious liberty, that the great bulk
of the early settlers of America came, and in the New World the English
traditions as to constitutional government and liberty under law were
early and firmly established. The centuries of struggle for representative
government in England at once bore fruit here. Colony charters, charters
of rights and liberties, public discussion, legislative assemblies, and
liberty under law were from the first made the foundation stones upon
which self-government in America was built up.

From an early date the American Colonies showed an independence to which
even Englishmen were scarcely accustomed, and when the home government
attempted to make the colonists pay some of the expenses of the Seven
Years' War, and a larger share of the expenses of colonial administration,
there was determined opposition. Having no representation in Parliament
and no voice in levying the tax, the colonists declared that taxation
without representation was tyranny, and refused to pay the taxes assessed.
Standing squarely on their rights as Englishmen, the colonists were
gradually forced into open rebellion. In 1765, and again in 1774,
Declarations of Rights were drawn up and adopted by representatives from
the Colonies, and were forwarded to the King. In 1774 the first
Continental Congress met and formed a union of the Colonies; in 1776 the
Colonies declared their independence. This was confirmed, in 1783, by the
Treaty of Paris; in 1787, the Constitution of the United States was
drafted; and in 1789, the American government began. In the preamble to
the twenty-seven charges of tyranny and oppression made against the King
in the Declaration of Independence, we find a statement of political
philosophy [31]  which is a combination of the results of the long English
struggle for liberty and the French eighteenth-century reform philosophy
and revolutionary demands. [32] This preamble declared:

    We hold these truths to be self-evident--that all men are created
    equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
    rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
    happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted
    among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
    governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
    these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it,
    and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such
    principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
    seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO WORLD HISTORY. The American Revolution and its
results were fraught with great importance for the future political and
educational progress of mankind. Before the close of the eighteenth
century the new American government had made at least four important
contributions to world liberty and progress which were certain to be of
large political and educational value for the future.

In the first place, the people of the Colonies had erected independent
governments and had shown the possibility of the self-government of
peoples on a large scale, and not merely in little city-states or
communities, as had previously been the case where self-government had
been tried. Democratic government was here worked out and applied to large
areas, and to peoples of diverse nationalities and embracing different
religious faiths. The possibility of States selecting their rulers and
successfully governing themselves was demonstrated.

In the second place, the new American government which was formed did
something new in world history when it united thirteen independent and
autonomous States into a single federated Nation, and without destroying
the independence of the States. What was formed was not a league, or
confederacy, as had existed at different times among differing groups of
the Greek City-States, and from time to time in the case of later Swiss
and temporary European national groupings, but the union into a
substantial and permanent Federal State of a number of separate States
which still retained their independence, and with provision for the
expansion of this national Union by the addition of new States. This
federal principle in government is probably the greatest political
contribution of the American Union to world development. In the twentieth-
century conception of a League of Nations it has borne still further
fruit.

In the third place, the different American States changed their old
Colonial Charters into definite written Constitutions, each of which
contained a Preamble or Bill of Rights which affirmed the fundamental
principles of democratic liberty (R. 251). These now became the
fundamental law for each of the separate States, and the same idea was
later worked out in the Constitution of the United States. These were the
first written constitutions of history, and have since served as a type
for the creation of constitutional government throughout the world. In
such documents to-day free peoples everywhere define the rights and duties
and obligations which they regard as necessary to their safety and
happiness and welfare.

Finally, the Federal Constitution provided for the inestimable boon of
religious liberty, and in a way that was both revolutionary and wholesome.
At the beginning of the War for Independence the Anglican (Episcopal)
faith had been declared "the established religion" in seven of the
Colonies, and the Congregational was the established religion in three of
the New England Colonies, while but three Colonies had declared for
religious freedom and refused to give a preference to any special creed.
This religious problem had to be met by the Constitutional Convention, and
this body handled it in the only way it could have been intelligently
handled in a nation composed of so many different religious sects as was
ours. It simply incorporated into the Federal Constitution provisions
which guaranteed the free exercise of their religious faith to all, and
forbade the establishment by Congress of any state religion, or the
requirement of any religious test as a prerequisite to holding any office
under the control of the Federal Government. The American people thus took
a stand for religious liberty at a time when the hatreds of the
Reformation still burned fiercely, and when tolerance in religious matters
was as yet but little known.

IMPORTANCE OF THE RELIGIOUS-LIBERTY CONTRIBUTION. The solution of the
religious question arrived at was only second in importance for us to the
establishment of the Federal Union, and the far-reaching significance to
our future national life of the sane and for-the-time extraordinary
provisions incorporated into our National Constitution can hardly be
overestimated. This action led to the early abandonment of state
religions, religious tests, and public taxation for religion in the old
States, and to the prohibition of these in the new. The importance of this
solution of the religious question for the future of popular education in
the United States was great, for it laid the foundations upon which our
systems of free, common, public, tax-supported, non-sectarian schools have
since been built up. How we could have erected a common public-school
system on a religious basis, with the many religious sects among us, it is
impossible to conceive. Instead, we should have had a series of feeble,
jealous, antagonistic, and utterly inefficient church-school systems,
chiefly confined to elementary education, and each largely intent on
teaching its peculiar church doctrines and struggling for an increasing
share of public funds.

How much the American people owe to the Fathers of the Republic for this
most enlightened and intelligent provision, few who have not thought
carefully on the matter can appreciate. To it we must trace not only the
great blessing of religious liberty, which we have so long enjoyed, but
also the final establishment of our common, free, public-school systems.
The beginning of the new state motive for education, which was soon to
supersede the religious motive, dates from the establishment with us of
republican governments; and the beginning of the emancipation of education
from church domination goes back to this wise provision inserted in our
National Constitution.

This national attitude was later copied in the state constitutions, and as
a preamble to practically all we find a Bill of Rights, which in almost
every case included a provision for freedom of religious worship (Rs. 251,
260). After the middle of the nineteenth century a further provision
prohibiting sectarian teaching or state aid to sectarian schools was
everywhere added.


V. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION SWEEPS AWAY ANCIENT ABUSES

NEW DEMANDS FOR REFORM THAT COULD NOT BE RESISTED. More than in any other
continental European country France had, by 1783, become a united nation,
conscious of a modern national feeling. Yet in France mediaeval abuses in
both State and Church had survived, as we have seen, to as great an extent
almost as in any European nation. So determined were the clergy and
nobility to retain their old powers, not only in France but throughout the
continent of Europe as well, that progressive reform seemed well-nigh
impossible. The work of the benevolent despots had, after all, been
superficial. By the last quarter of the eighteenth, though, a progressive
change was under way which was certain to produce either evolution or
revolution. The influence of the American experiment in nation-building
now became pronounced. In 1779 Franklin took a copy of the new
Pennsylvania Constitution with him to Paris, and in 1780 John Adams did
the same with the Massachusetts Constitution. Frenchmen instantly
recognized here, in concrete form, the ideas with which their own heads
were filled. In 1783 Franklin published in France a French translation of
all the American Constitutions, and the National Constitution of 1787 was
as eagerly read and discussed in Paris as in New York or Philadelphia or
Boston. America appeared to the French of that stormy period as an ideal
land; where the dreams of Rousseau about the social contract had been
transformed into realities. Two years later the _cahiers_ of the Third
Estate demanded a written constitution for France. The French, too, had
aided the American Colonies in their struggle for liberty, and French
soldiers returning home carried back new political ideas drawn from the
remarkable political progress of the new American Nation. By 1788 the
demand for reform in France had become so insistent, and the condition of
the treasury of the State was so bad, that it was finally felt necessary
to summon a meeting of the States-General--a sort of national parliament
consisting of representatives of the three great Estates: clergy,
nobility, and commons--which had not met in France since 1614.

[Illustration: FIG. 153. THE STATES-GENERAL IN SESSION AT VERSAILLES
(After a contemporary drawing by Monnet)]

Besides electing its representatives, each locality and order was allowed
to draw up a series of instructions, or _cahiers_ (+R. 252+), for the
guidance of its delegates. These _cahiers_ are a mine of information as to
the demands and hopes and interests of the French people, [33] and it is
interesting to know that the _cahiers_ of nobility, clergy, and commons
alike included, among their demands, the organization of a comprehensive
plan of education for France. [34]

FRANCE ESTABLISHES CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. The States-General met May
5, 1789, and soon (June 20) resolved itself into the National or
Constituent Assembly. Terrified by the uprisings and burnings of châteaux
throughout France, on the night of August fourth, in a few hours, it
adopted a series of decrees which virtually abolished the _Ancien Régime_
of privileges for France. The nobility gave up most of their old rights,
the serfs [35] were freed, and the special privileges of towns were
surrendered. Later the Assembly adopted a "Declaration of Rights of Man
and of the Citizen" (R. 253), much like the American Declaration of
Independence. This declared, among other things, that all men were born
free and have equal rights, that taxes should be proportional to wealth,
that all citizens were equal before the law and have a right to help make
the laws, and that the people of the nation were sovereign. These
principles struck at the very foundations of the old system.

Soon a Constitution for France, the first ever promulgated in modern
Europe, was prepared and adopted (1791). This abolished the ancient
privileges and reorganized France as a self-governing nation, much after
the American plan. Local government was created, and the absolute monarchy
was changed to a limited constitutional one. Next the property of the
Church was taken over by the State, the monasteries were suppressed, and
the priests and bishops were made state officials and paid a fixed state
salary. The Jesuits had been expelled from France in 1764; and in 1792 the
Brothers of the Christian Schools were not allowed longer to teach. Among
other important matters, the Constitution of 1791 declared that:

    There shall be created and organized a system of public instruction
    common to all citizens, and gratuitous, with respect to those branches
    of instruction which are indispensable for all men.

Up to this point the Revolution in France had proceeded relatively
peacefully, considering the nature of the long-standing abuses which were
to be remedied. In August, 1792, the King was imprisoned, and in January,
1793, he was executed and a Republic proclaimed. [36] Then followed a
reign of terror, which we do not need to follow, and which ended only when
Napoleon became master of France.

BENEFICENT RESULTS OF THE REVOLUTION. The French Revolution was not an
accident or a product of chance, but rather the inevitable result of an
attempt to dam up the stream of human progress and prevent its orderly
onward flow. The Protestant Revolts were the first great revolutionary
wave, the Puritan revolution in England was another, the formation of the
American Republic and the institution of constitutional government and
religious freedom another, while the French Revolution brought the rising
movement to a head and swept away, in a deluge of blood, the very
foundations of the mediaeval system. Along with much that was disastrous,
the French Revolution accomplished after all much that was of greatest
importance for human progress. The world at times seems to be in need of
such a great catharsis. Progress was made in a decade that could hardly
have been made in a century by peaceful evolution. The old order of
privilege came to an end, mediaevalism was swept away, and the serf was
evolved into the free farmer and citizen. One fifth of the soil of France
was restored to the use of the people from the monasteries, and an
additional one third from the Church and nobility. The new principles of
citizenship--Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity--were for France
revolutionary in the extreme, while the assertion that the sovereignty of
a nation rests with the people rather than with the king, here
successfully promulgated, ended for all time the "divine-right-of-kings"
idea for France. After political theory had for a time run mad, the
organizing genius of Napoleon consolidated the gains, gave France a strong
government, a uniform code of laws, [37] and began that organization of
schools for the nation which ultimately meant the taking over of education
from the Church and its provision at the expense of and in the interests
of the nation.

THE NATIONAL IDEA EXTENDS TO OTHER LANDS. The reform work in France,
together with the examples of English and American liberty, soon began to
have their influence in other lands as well. People everywhere began to
see that the old régime of privilege and misgovernment ought to be
replaced. Other countries abolished serfdom, introduced better laws, and
made reforms in the abuses of both Church and State. French armies and
rulers carried the best of French ideas to other lands, and, where the
French rule continued long enough, these ideas became fixed. In particular
was the _Code Napoléon_ copied in the Netherlands, the Italian States, and
the States of southern and western Germany. The national spirit of Italy
was awakened, and the Italian liberals began to look forward to the day
when the small Italian States might be reunited into an Italian Nation,
with Rome as its capital. This became the work of nineteenth-century
Italian statesmen. For the first time in Spanish history, too, the people
became conscious, under French occupation, of a feeling of national unity,
and similarly the national spirit of German lands was stirred by the
conquests of Napoleon.

A constitution was obtained in Spain, in 1812, and between 1815 and 1821
all of Spain's South American colonies--Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela--revolted,
became independent, and set up republics with constitutional governments,
some of the larger ones based on the federal principle, as in the United
States. Brazil similarly freed itself from Portugal and set up a
constitutional and federated monarchy, in 1822. The Kingdom of Naples
obtained constitutional government in 1820, and Sardinia in 1821. In 1823,
when Spain with Austria's aid prepared to reconquer the Spanish South
American Republics, President Monroe transmitted to the American Congress
his message in which he declared that any attempt on the part of European
nations to suppress republicanism on the American continent would be
considered by the United States as an unfriendly act. This has since been
known as the _Monroe Doctrine_. In 1829 Greece obtained her independence
from Turkey, and in 1843 a constitutional form of government was obtained.

IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES OF THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT. Since the closing
decades of the eighteenth century, when democratic government and written
constitutions began, the sweep of democratic government has become almost
world wide. Nation after nation has changed to democratic and
constitutional forms of government, the latest additions being Portugal
(1911), China (1912), Russia (1917), and Germany (1918). New English
colonies, too, have carried English self-government into almost every
continent. The World War of 1914-18 gave a new emphasis to democracy, and
there is good reason to believe that government of and by and for the
people is ultimately destined to prevail among all the intelligent nations
and races of the earth.

With the development of democratic government there has everywhere been a
softening of old laws, the growth of humanitarianism, the wider and wider
extension of the suffrage, important legislation as to labor, a previously
unknown attention to the poor and the dependents of society, a vast
extension of educational advantages, and the taking over of education from
the Church by the State and the erection of the school into an important
institution for the preservation and advancement of the national welfare.
These consequences of the onward sweep of new-world ideas we shall trace
more in detail in the chapters which follow.

CHAPTER XX

THE BEGINNINGS OF NATIONAL EDUCATION


I. NEW CONCEPTIONS OF THE EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE

THE STATE AS SERVANT OF THE CHURCH. With the rise of the Protestant sects
we noted, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and for the first time
since Christianity became supreme in the western world, the beginnings of
a state connection with the education of the young. The Protestant
reformers, obtaining the support of the Protestant princes and kings, had
successfully used this support to assist them in the organization of
church schools as an aid to the reformed faith. Luther, it will be
recalled (p. 312), had made a strong appeal to the mayors and magistrates
of all German lands to establish schools as a part of their civic duties
(R. 156), and had contended that a solemn obligation rested upon them to
do so. The Dutch Provinces had worked closely with the Dutch Protestant
synods (p. 334) in ordering schools established and in providing for their
financing; Calvin had organized a religious City-State at Geneva (p. 330),
of which religion and learning had been the corner-stones; the Scottish
Parliament, by the laws of 1633 and 1646 (p. 335), had ordered schools for
Scottish children in connection with the churches; and in the Scandinavian
countries and in Finland the beginnings of a connection with the State had
also been made (p. 315). Finally, in the new Massachusetts Colony the laws
of 1642 and 1647 (p. 366) had, for the first time in the English-speaking
world, ordered that children be taught "to read and understand the
principles of religion and the capital laws of the country" (p. 364), and
that schools be established by the towns, under penalty if they refused to
do so. In all Protestant lands we saw that the reformers appealed, from
time to time, to what were then the servants of the churches--the rising
civil governments and principalities and States--to use their civil
authority to force the people to meet their new religious obligations in
the matter of schooling.

The purpose of the schooling ordered established, however, was almost
wholly religious. Massachusetts, in ordering instruction in the "capital
laws of the country," as well as reading and religion, had formed a marked
exception. In nearly all lands the rising state governments merely helped
the Protestant churches to create the elementary vernacular religious
school, and to make of it an auxiliary for the protection of orthodoxy and
the advancement of the faith. Even in the new state school systems of the
German States--Saxony, Würtemberg (p. 317), Brunswick, Weimar, Gotha--the
elementary schools established were for religious rather than for state
ends. This condition continued until well toward the middle of the
eighteenth century.

THE NEW STATE THEORY OF EDUCATION. After about the middle of the
eighteenth century a new theory as to the purpose of education, and one
destined to make rapid headway, began to be advanced. This theory had
already made marked progress, as we shall see, in the New England
Colonies, and had also found expression, as we shall also see in a later
chapter, in the organizing work of Frederick the Great in Prussia. It was
from the French political philosophers of the eighteenth century, though,
that its clearest definition came. They now advanced the idea that schools
were essentially civil affairs, the purpose of which should be to promote
the everyday interests of society and the welfare of the State, rather
than the welfare of the Church, and to prepare for a life here rather than
a life hereafter.

After about 1750 a critical and reformatory pedagogy rapidly began to take
shape in France, and the second half of the eighteenth century became a
period of criticism and discontent and reconstruction in education, as
well as in politics and religion.

This criticism and discontent in France was greatly stimulated by the
decline in character and influence of the Jesuit schools. Unwilling to
change their instruction to meet the needs of a changing society, their
schools had become formal in character (R. 146), and were now engaged
chiefly in stilling thinking rather than in promoting it. In consequence
the schools had fallen into disrepute throughout all France. The Society,
too, in the eighteenth century, came to be a powerful political
organization which strove to dominate the State. So bad had the situation
become by 1762, that the different parliaments in the provinces and in
Paris had formulated complaints against the Jesuits and their schools, [1]
and, in 1764, the king was induced to suppress the Order. [2] This decline
in influence and final suppression of the Society gave rise to some rather
remarkable pedagogical literature, which looked to the creation of a
system of state secondary schools in France to replace those of the
Jesuits.

The outcome was the rise of a new national and individual conception of
the educational purpose. This was destined in time to spread to other
lands and to lead to the rise of complete state school systems, financed
and managed by the State and conducted for state ends, and to the ultimate
divorce of Church and State, in all progressive lands, in the matter of
the education of the young. Teachers trained and certificated by the State
were in time to supplant the nuns and brothers of the religious
congregations in Catholic lands, as well as teachers who served as
assistants to the pastors in Protestant lands and whose chief purpose was
to uphold the teachings and advance the interests of the sect; citizens
were to supplant the ecclesiastic in the supervision of instruction; and
the courses of instruction were to be changed in direction and vastly
broadened in scope to make them minister to the needs of the State rather
than the Church, and to prepare pupils for useful life here rather than
for life in another world.


II. THE NEW STATE THEORY IN FRANCE

[Illustration: FIG. 154. ROUSSEAU (1712-78)]

THE FRENCH POLITICAL THEORISTS. The leading French political theorists of
the two decades between 1760 and 1780 now began to discuss education as in
theory a civil affair, intimately connected with the promotion of the
welfare of the State. The more important of these, and their chief ideas
were:

1. _Rousseau._ The first of the critical and reformatory pedagogical
writers to awaken any large interest and obtain a general hearing was
Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The same year (1762) that his _Social Contract_
appeared and attacked the foundations of the old political system (p.
483), his _Émile_ also appeared and attacked with equal vigor the
religious and social theory as to education then prevailing throughout
western Europe. For the stiff and unnatural methods in education, under
which children were dressed and made to behave as adults, [3] the harsh
discipline of the time, and the excessive emphasis on religious
instruction and book education, he preached the substitution of life amid
nature, childish ways and sports, parental love, and an education that
considered the instincts and natural development of children.

Gathering up the political and social ideas of his age as to
ecclesiastical and political despotism; the nature of the social contract;
that the "state of nature" was the ideal one, and the one in which men had
been intended to live; that human duty called for a return to the "state
of nature," whatever that might be; and that the artificiality and
hypocrisy of his age in manners, dress, religion, and education were all
wrong--Rousseau restated his political philosophy in terms of the
education of the boy, Émile. Despite its many exaggerations, much faulty
reasoning, and many imperfections, the book had a tremendous influence
upon Europe in laying bare the limitations and defects and abuses of the
formal and ecclesiastical education of the time. [4] He may be regarded as
the first important writer to sap the foundations of the old system of
religious education, and to lay a basis for a new type of child training
(R. 254). Though Rousseau's enthusiasm took the form of theory run mad,
and the educational plan he proposed was largely impossible, he
nevertheless popularized education, not only in France, but among the
reading public of the progressive European States as well. After he had
written, the old limited and narrow religious education was on the
defensive, and, though time was required, the transition to a more secular
type of education was inevitable as fast as nations and peoples could
shake off the dominance of the Church in state affairs.

[Illustration: FIG. 155 LA CHALOTAIS (1701-83)]

2. _La Chalotais._ The year following the publication of Rousseau's
_Émile_ appeared La Chalotais's _Essai d'éducation nationale_ (1763). René
de la Chalotais, a Solicitor-General for the Parliament of Bretagne, was
one of the notable French parliamentarians of the middle of the eighteenth
century. Unlike Rousseau's highly imaginary, exaggerated, sentimental, and
paradoxical volume, La Chalotais produced a practical and philosophical
discussion of the problem of the education of a people. Declaring firmly
that education was essentially a civil affair; that it was the function of
government to make citizens contented by educating them for their sphere
in society; that citizen and secular teachers should not be excluded for
celibates; [5] that the real purpose of education should be to prepare
citizens for France; that the poor were deserving of education; and that
"the most enlightened people will always have the advantage" in the
struggles of a modern world, La Chalotais produced a work which was warmly
approved by such political philosophers as Voltaire, Diderot, and Turgot,
and which was translated into several European languages (R. 255). Though
far less widely read than Rousseau's _Émile_, it was far more influential
in shaping subsequent political theory and action regarding the relations
of education to the State. Nearly every proposal for educational
legislation during the days of the Revolution went back in idea to this
philosophic discussion of the question by La Chalotais and to the
practical proposals of Rolland and Turgot.

[Illustration: FIG. 156. ROLLAND (1734-93)]

3. _Rolland._ In 1768 Rolland, president of the Parliament of Paris,
presented to his colleagues a report in which he outlined a national
system of education to replace both the schools of the Jesuits and those
of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. La Chalotais had proposed a more
modern system of state schools chiefly to replace those of the Jesuits,
but Rolland went further and proposed the extension of education to all,
and the supervision of all schools by a central council of the Government.
By means of a centralized control, a central university to which the other
universities of France were to be subordinate, a higher normal school to
train teachers for the colleges (secondary schools), and universal
education, [6] Rolland hoped to develop for France a national spirit, a
national character, and a national government and code of laws, and to
bring the youth of the provinces into harmony with the best of all French
ideas.

4. _Turgot._ In 1774 Turgot was appointed Minister of Finance (p. 481),
and in 1775 he made a series of recommendations to the King in which he
set forth ideas analogous to those of Rolland, and presented an eloquent
plea for the formation of a national council of public instruction and the
establishment of a system of civil and national education for the whole of
France. In closing he wrote:

    Your kingdom, Sir, is of this world. Without opposing any obstacle
    to the instructions whose object is higher, and which already have
    their rules and their expounders, I think I can propose to you nothing
    of more advantage to your people than to cause to be given to all your
    subjects an instruction which shows them the obligations they owe to
    society and to your power to protect them, and the interest they have
    in fulfilling those duties for the public good and their own. This
    moral and social instruction requires books expressly prepared, by
    competition, and with great care, and a schoolmaster in each parish to
    teach them to children, along with the art of writing, reading,
    counting, measuring, and the principles of mechanics. The study of the
    duty of citizenship  ought to be the foundation of all the other
    studies.... There are methods and establishments for training
    geometricians, physicists, and painters, but there are none for
    training citizens.

5. _Diderot._ In 1776 Diderot, editor with D'Alembert of the
_Encyclopaedia_ (1751-72), prepared, at the request of Catherine II (p.
477), under the title of _Plan of a University_, a complete scheme for the
organization of a state system of public instruction for Russia. Though
the plan was never carried out, it was printed and much discussed in
France, and is important as coming from one of the most influential
Frenchmen of his time. He commends as an example to be followed the work
of the German States in the organization of popular instruction. For
Russia he outlines first a system of people's schools, which shall be free
and obligatory for all, and in which instruction in reading, writing,
arithmetic, morals, civics, and religion shall be taught. "From the Prime
Minister to the lowest peasant," he says, "it is good for every one to
know how to read, write, and count." For the series of secondary schools
to be established, he condemns the usual practice of devoting so much of
the instruction to the humanities and a mediaeval type of logic and
ethics, and urges instead the introduction of instruction in mathematics,
in the modern sciences, literature, and the work of governments. Classical
studies he would confine to the last years of the course. Science,
history, drawing, and music find a place in his scheme.

All this instruction Diderot would place under the supervisory control of
an administrative bureau to be known as the _University of Russia_, at the
head of which should be a statesman, who should exercise control of all
the work of public instruction beneath. Though never carried out in
Russia, the University of France of 1808 is largely an embodiment of the
ideas he proposed in 1776.

LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO EMBODY THESE IDEAS. During the quarter of a
century between the publication of Rousseau's _Émile_ and the summoning of
the States-General to reform France (1762-88), the educational as well as
the political ideas of the French reformers had taken deep root with the
thinking classes of the nation. The _cahiers_ of 1789, of all Orders (p.
500), gave evidence of this in their somewhat general demand for the
creation of some form of an educational system for France (R. 252). From
the first days of the Revolution pedagogical literature became plentiful,
and the successive National Assemblies found time, amid the internal
reorganization of France, constitution-making, the troubles with and trial
of the King, and the darkening cloud of foreign intervention, to listen to
reports and addresses on education and to enact a bill for the
organization of a national school system. The more important of these
educational efforts were:

1. _The Constituent Assembly_ (June 17, 1789, to September 30, 1791). In
the Constituent Assembly, into which the States-General resolved itself,
June 17, 1789, and which continued until after it had framed the
constitution of 1791, two notable addresses and one notable report on the
organization of education were made. The Count de Mirabeau, a nobleman
turned against his class and elected to the States-General as a
representative of the Third Estate, made addresses on the "Organization of
a Teaching Body" and on the "Organization of a National _Lycée_." In the
first he advocated the establishment of primary schools throughout France.
In the second he proposed the establishment of colleges of literature in
each department, with a National _Lycée_ at Paris for higher (university)
education, and to contain the essentials of a national normal school or
teachers' college as well.

[Illustration: FIG. 157 COUNT DE MIRABEAU (1749-91)]

[Illustration: FIG. 158. TALLEYRAND (1758-1838)]

Mirabeau's proposals represent rather a transition in thinking from the
old to the new, but the Report of Talleyrand (1791), former Bishop of
Autun, now turned revolutionist, embodies the full culmination of
revolutionary educational thought. Public instruction he termed "a power
which embraces everything, from the games of infancy to the most imposing
fêtes of the Nation." He definitely proposed the organization of a
complete state system of public instruction for France, to consist of a
primary school in every canton (community, district), open to the children
of peasants and workmen--classes heretofore unprovided with education; a
secondary school in every department (county); a series of special schools
in the chief French cities, to prepare for the professions; and a National
Institute, or University, to be located at Paris. Inspired by
Montesquieu's principle that "the laws of education ought to be relative
to the principles of government," Talleyrand proposed a bill designed to
give effect to the provisions of the Constitution of 1791 relating to
education (p. 501), and to provide an education for the people of France
who were now to exercise, through elected representatives, the legislative
power for France. Instruction he held to be the necessary counterpoise of
liberty, and every citizen was to be taught to know, obey, love, and
protect the new constitution. Political, social, and personal morality
were to take the place of religion in the cantonal schools, which were to
be free and equally open to all. As the Constituent Assembly was succeeded
by the newly elected Legislative Assembly within three weeks after
Talleyrand submitted his Report, no action was taken on his bill.

[Illustration: FIG. 159. CONDORCET (1743-94)]

2. _The Legislative Assembly_ (October 1, 1791, to September 21, 1792).
This new legislative body was far more radical in character than its
predecessor, and far more radical than was the sentiment of France at the
time. Among other acts it abolished (1792) the old universities and
confiscated (1793) their property to the State. To it was submitted (April
20-21, 1792) by the mathematician, philosopher, and revolutionist, Marquis
de Condorcet, [7] on behalf of the Committee on Public Instruction and as
a measure of reconstruction, a Report and draft of a Law for the
organization of a complete democratic system of public instruction for
France (R. 256). It provided for the organizing of a primary school for
every four hundred inhabitants, in which each individual was "to be taught
to direct his own conduct and to enjoy the plenitude of his own rights,"
and where principles would be taught, calculated to "insure the
perpetuation of liberty and equality." The bill also provided, for the
first time, for the organization of higher primary schools in the
principal towns; colleges (secondary schools) in the chief cities (one for
every four thousand inhabitants); a higher school for each "department";
_Lycées_, or institutions of still higher learning, at nine places in
France; and a National Society of Sciences and Arts to crown the
educational system at Paris. The national system of education he proposed
was to be equally open to women, as well as men, and to be gratuitous
throughout. Teachers for each grade of school were to be prepared in the
school next above. Sunday lectures for workingmen and peasants were to be
given by teachers everywhere. Public morality, political intelligence,
human progress, and the preservation of liberty and equality were the aims
of the instruction. The necessity for education in a constitutional
government he saw clearly. "A free constitution," he writes, "which should
not be correspondent to the universal instruction of citizens, would come
to destruction after a few conflicts, and would degenerate into one of
those forms of government which cannot preserve the peace among an
ignorant and corrupt people." Anarchy or despotism he held to be the
future for peoples who become free without being enlightened. He held it
to be a fundamental principle that:

    The order of nature includes no distinctions in society beyond those
    of education and wealth. To establish among citizens an equality in
    fact, and to realize the equality confirmed by law, ought to be the
    primary object of national instruction.

The bill proposed by Condorcet, while too ambitious for the France of his
day, was thoroughly sound as a democratic theory of education, and an
accurate prediction of what the nineteenth century brought generally into
existence. Condorcet's Report was discussed, but not acted upon.

[Illustration: FIG. 160. THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE
Founded by Article 298 of the Constitution of Year III (1793)]

3. _The National Convention_ (September 21, 1792, to October 26, 1795).
The Convention was also a radical body, deeply interested in the creation
of a system of state schools for the people of France. To higher education
there was for a time marked opposition, though later in its history the
Convention erected a number of important higher technical institutions and
schools, among the most important of which was the Institute of France.
There was also in the Convention marked opposition to all forms of
clerical control of schools. The schools of the Brothers of the Christian
Schools were suppressed by it, in 1792, and all secular and endowed
schools and colleges were abolished and their property confiscated, in
1793. The complete supremacy of the State in all educational matters was
now asserted. Great enthusiasm was manifested for the organization of
state primary schools, which were ordered established in 1793 (R. 258 a),
and in these:

    Children of all classes were to receive that first education,
    physical, moral, and intellectual, the best adapted to develop in them
    republican manners, patriotism, and the love of labor, and to render
    them worthy of liberty and equality.

    The course of instruction was to include: "to speak, read, and write
    correctly the French language; the geography of France; the rights and
    duties of men and citizens; [8] the first notions of natural and
    familiar objects; the use of numbers, the compass, the level, the
    system of weights and measures, the mechanical powers, and the
    measurement of time. They are to be taken into the fields and the
    workshops where they may see agricultural and mechanical operations
    going on, and take part in the same so far as their age will allow."

What a change from the course of instruction in the religious schools just
preceding this period!

[Illustration: FIG. 161. LAKANAL (1762-1845)]

A multiplicity of reports, bills, and decrees, often more or less
contradictory but still embodying ideas advanced by Condorcet and
Talleyrand, now appeared. Whereas the preceding legislative bodies had
considered the subject carefully, but without taking action, the
Convention now acted. The nation, though, was so engrossed by the internal
chaos and foreign aggression that there was neither time nor funds to
carry the decrees into effect.

The most extreme proposal of the period was the bill of Lepelletier le
Saint-Fargeau to create a national system of education modeled closely
after that of ancient Sparta. The best of the proposals probably was the
Lakanal Law, of November 17, 1794, which ordered a school for every one
thousand inhabitants, with special divisions for boys and girls, and which
provided for instruction in:

    1. Reading and writing the French language.
    2. The Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Constitution.
    3. Lessons on republican morals.
    4. The rules of simple calculation and surveying.
    5. Lessons in geography and the phenomena of nature.
    6. Lessons on heroic actions, and songs of triumph.

Lakanal also carefully prescribed the method of instruction, and advocated
the founding of a national normal school (Latin _norma_; a rule), which
idea the Convention adopted in 1794, the school opening [9] in January,
1795. Supplementing this was the law of February 25, 1795, ordering
central or higher schools established to replace the former colleges, [10]
one for every three hundred thousand of the population, which were to
offer instruction from twelve to eighteen. The course was to include:

    12 to 14--Drawing, natural history, ancient and living languages.
    14 to 16--Mathematics, natural philosophy, experimental chemistry.
    16 to 18--Grammar, literature, history, legislation.

Organized on a soviet principle, each professor declared the equal of
every other, and lacking any effective administration or discipline, these
institutions soon fell into disrepute and were displaced when Napoleon
reorganized secondary education in France.

The law of October 25, 1795, closed the work of the Convention. This made
less important provisions for primary education (R. 258 b) than had
preceding bills, but was the only permanent contribution of this period to
the organization of primary schools. It placed greater emphasis than had
the legislative Assembly on the creation of secondary and higher
institutions (R. 258 a), of more value to the bourgeois class. This bill
of 1795 represents a reaction from the extreme republican ideas of a few
years earlier, and the triumph of the conservative middle-class elements
in the nation over the radical republican elements previously in control.

The Convention also, in the latter part of its history, created a number
of higher technical institutions of importance, which were expressive
alike of the French interest in scientific subjects which arose during the
latter part of the eighteenth century, and of the new French military
needs. Many of these institutions have persisted to the present, so well
have they answered the scientific interests and needs of the nation. A
mere list of the institutions created is all that need be given. These
were:

    Museum or Conservatory of Arts (Jan. 16, 1794).
    Conservatory of Arts and Trades (Oct. 10, 1794).
    New medical schools (_Schools of Health_) ordered (Dec. 4, 1794).
    Museum of Natural History (Dec. 11, 1794).
    Central Schools to succeed the former Colleges (secondary schools)
      (Feb. 25, 1795).
    School of Living Oriental Languages (March 30, 1795).
    Veterinary Schools (April 21, 1795).
    Course in Archaeology, National Library (June 8, 1795).
    Bureau of Longitude (June 29, 1795).
    Conservatory of Music (Aug. 3, 1795).
    The National Library (Oct. 17, 1795).
    Museum of Archaeological Monuments (Oct. 20, 1795).
    Polytechnic Schools (R. 257);
      School of Civil Engineering;
      School of Hydrographic Engineers;
      and School of Mining (Oct. 22, 1795).

The Convention also adopted the metric system of weights and measures;
enacted laws under which the peasants could acquire title to the lands
they had tilled for so long; and began the unification of the laws of the
different parts of the country into a single set, which later culminated
in the _Code Napoléon_.

4. _The Directory_ (1795-99) _and the Consulate_ (1799-1804). The
Revolution had by this time largely spent itself, the Directory followed,
and in 1799 Napoleon became First Consul and for the next sixteen years
was master of France. The Law of 1795 for primary schools (R. 258 b) was
but feebly administered under the Directory, as foreign wars absorbed the
energies and resources of the Government. Napoleon's chief educational
interest, too, was in opening up opportunities for talent to rise, in
encouraging scientific work and higher specialized institutions, and in
developing schools of a type that would support the kind of government he
had imposed upon France. The secondary and higher schools he established
and promoted cost him money at a time when money was badly needed for
national defense, and primary education was accordingly neglected during
the time he directed the destinies of the nation. His educational
organizations and work we shall refer to again in a later chapter.

The Revolutionary enthusiasts had stated clearly their theory of
republican education, but had failed to establish a permanent state school
system according to their plans. This now became the work of the
nineteenth century. In the meantime, in the new United States of America
the same ideas were taking shape and finding expression, and to the
developments there we next turn.


III. THE NEW STATE THEORY IN AMERICA

WANING OF THE OLD RELIGIOUS INTEREST. As early as 1647 Rhode Island Colony
had enacted the first law providing for freedom of religious worship ever
enacted by an English-speaking people, and two years later Maryland
enacted a similar law. Though the Maryland law was later repealed, and a
rigid Church-of-England rule established there, these laws were indicative
of the new spirit arising in the New World. By the beginning of the
eighteenth century a change in attitude toward the old problem of personal
salvation had become evident. Frontier conditions; the gradual rise of a
civil as opposed to a religious form of town government; the rising
interests in trade and shipping; the beginnings of the breakdown of the
old aristocratic traditions and customs transplanted from Europe; the
rising individualism in both Europe and America--these all helped to
weaken the hold on the people of the old religious doctrines.

By 1750 the change in religious thinking in the American Colonies had
become quite marked. [11] Especially was this change evidenced in the
dying-out of the old religious fervor and intolerance, and the breaking-up
of the old religious solidarity. While most of the Colonies continued to
maintain an "established Church," other sects had to be admitted to the
Colony and given freedom of worship. The Puritan monopoly in New England
was broken, as was also that of the Anglican faith in the central
Colonies. The day of the monopoly of any sect in a Colony was over. New
secular interests began to take the place of religion as the chief topic
of thought and conversation, and secular books began to dispute the
earlier predominance of the Bible. A few colonial newspapers had begun
(seven by 1750), and these became expressive of the new colony interests.

CHANGING CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS. These changes in attitude toward the
old religious problems materially affected both the support and the
character of the education provided in the Colonies. The Law of 1647,
requiring the maintenance of the Latin grammar schools, had been found to
be increasingly difficult of enforcement, not only in Massachusetts, but
in all the other New England Colonies which had followed the Massachusetts
example. With the changing attitude of the people, which had become
clearly manifest by 1750, the demand for relief from the maintenance of
this school in favor of a more practical and less aristocratic type of
higher school, if higher school were needed at all, became marked. By the
close of the colonial period the new American Academy (p. 463), with its
more practical studies, had begun to supersede the old Latin grammar
school.

The elementary school experienced something of the same difficulties. Many
of the parochial schools died out, while others declined in character and
importance. In Church-of-England Colonies all elementary education was
left to private initiative and philanthropic and religious effort (p.
373). In the southern Colonies the classes in society and the character of
the plantation life made common schools impossible, and the feeling of any
need for elementary schools almost entirely died out. In New England the
eighteenth century was a continual struggle on the one hand to prevent the
original religious town school from disappearing, and on the other to
establish in its place a series of scattered and inferior district
schools, while either church or town support and tuition fees became ever
harder to obtain. Among other changes of importance the reading school and
the writing school now became definitely united, in all the smaller places
and in the rural districts, as a measure of economy, to form the American
school of the "3 Rs." New textbooks, too, containing less of the gloomily
religious than the _New England Primer_, and secular rather than religious
in character (p. 443), appeared after 1750 and began to be used in the
schools. After 1750, too, it was increasingly evident that the old
religious enthusiasm for schools had largely died out; that European
traditions and ways and types of schools no longer completely satisfied;
and that the period of the transplanting of European educational ideas and
schools and types of instruction was coming to an end. Instead, the
evolution of a public or state school out of the original religious
school, and the beginnings of the evolution of distinctly American types
of schools, better adapted to American needs, became increasingly evident
in the Colonies as the eighteenth century progressed.

RISE OF THE CIVIL OF STATE SCHOOL. As has been stated earlier, the school
everywhere in America arose as a child of the Church. In the Middle
Colonies, where the parochial-school conception of education was the
prevailing type, the school remained under church control until after the
foundation of our national government. In New England, though--and the New
England evolution in time became the prevailing American practice--the
school passed through a very interesting development during colonial
times.

As we have seen (p. 360), each little New England town was originally
established as a little religious republic, with the Church in complete
control. The governing authorities for church and civil affairs were much
the same. When acting as church officers they were known as Elders and
Deacons; when acting as civil or town officers they were known as
Selectmen. The State, as represented in the colony legislature or the town
meeting, was clearly the servant of the Church, and existed in large part
for religious ends. It was the State acting as the servant of the Church
which enacted the Massachusetts laws of 1642 and 1647 (Rs. 190, 19l),
requiring the towns to maintain schools for religious ends. Now, so close
was the connection between the religious town, which controlled church
affairs, and the civil town, which looked after roads, fences, taxes, and
defense--the constituency of both being one and the same, and the meetings
of both being held at first in the meeting-house--that when the schools
were established the colony legislature placed them under the civil--as
involving taxes, and being a public service--rather than under the
religious town. The interests of one were the interests of both, and,
being the same in constituency and territorial boundaries, there seemed no
occasion for friction or fear. From this religious beginning the civil
school and the civil school-town and school-township, with all their
elaborate school administrative machinery, were later evolved.

The erection of a town hall, separate from the meeting-house, was a first
step in the process. School affairs now were discussed at the town hall,
instead of in the church. The town authorities now appointed committees to
locate and build schoolhouses, select and certificate the teachers, and
visit and examine the school. Next a regular town school committee was
provided for. To this was given the management of the town school, and
town taxes, instead of church taxes, were voted for buildings and
maintenance. The minister continued to certificate the grammar-school
master until the close of the colonial period, but the power to
certificate the elementary-school teachers passed to the town authorities
early in the eighteenth century. By the close of the century all that the
minister--as the only surviving representative of church control--had left
to him was the right to accompany the town authorities in the visitation
of schools. Thus gradually but certainly did the earlier religious school
in America pass out from under the control of the Church and come under
the control of the State. When our national government and the different
state governments were established, the States were ready to accept, in
principle at least, the theory gradually worked out in New England that
schools are state institutions, and should be under the control of the
State.

THE EARLY STATE CONSTITUTIONS AND LAWS. In framing the Federal
Constitution, in 1787, education, then being regarded largely as a local
matter, was left to the States to handle as they saw fit; so we turn to
the early state constitutions and laws to see how far the new American
States had, by the close of the eighteenth century, advanced toward the
conception of education as an affair of the State.

During the period from the Declaration of Independence to the close of the
eighteenth century (1776-1800), all the States, except Rhode Island and
Connecticut, which considered their colonial charters as satisfactory,
formulated and adopted new state constitutions. Three new States--Vermont,
Kentucky, and Tennessee--were admitted to the Union before 1800, and these
framed constitutions also. Of the sixteen States forming the Union by
1800, seven had incorporated into their constitutions a clause setting
forth the State's duty in the matter of education (R. 259). As in the
earlier period of American education, it was Calvinistic New England which
incorporated into the constitutions the best provisions regarding
learning. In the parochial-school central Colonies the mention was much
less emphatic, while the old Anglican-Church Colonies and the new States
of Kentucky and Tennessee remained silent on the subject. Massachusetts,
Vermont, and New Hampshire, in particular, incorporated strong sections
directing the encouragement of learning and virtue, the protection and
fostering of school societies, and the establishment of schools. The
Massachusetts provision, afterwards copied by New Hampshire, is so
explicit in the matter of state duty that it is worth quoting in full.

    Chap. V, Sec. 2. Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused
    generally among the body of the people, being necessary for the
    preservation of their rights and liberties; and as these depend on
    spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the various
    parts of the country, and among the different orders of the people, it
    shall be the duty of the legislatures and magistrates, in all future
    periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish the interests of literature
    and the sciences, and all seminaries of them; especially the
    university at Cambridge, public schools, and grammar schools in the
    towns; to encourage private societies and public institutions, by
    rewards and immunities, for the promotion of agriculture, arts,
    sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures, and a natural history of the
    country; to countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and
    general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and
    frugality, honesty and punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good
    humor, and all social affections and generous sentiments among the
    people.

Though the Federal Constitution made no provision for education or aid to
schools, when the Congress of the Confederation, in 1787, adopted the
Ordinance for the organization and government of the Northwest Territory,
out of which the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and
Wisconsin were later carved, it prefixed to this Ordinance the following
significant provision:

    Art. 3. Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good
    government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of
    education shall forever be encouraged [in the States to be formed from
    this Territory].

By the time the first State formed from this western territory was ready
to be admitted to the Union (Ohio, 1802), the theory that education is a
function of the State had come to be so thoroughly accepted, in principle
at least, by the new American people that Congress now began a policy,
ever since continued, of aiding each new State to establish and maintain a
state system of schools. To this end Congress gave the new State for this
purpose a generous endowment of national land, and in addition three
townships of land to endow a state university. We also find that the
constitutions of the first States created from this new Northwest
Territory (Ohio, 1802; Indiana, 1816 [12]) contain for the time good
provisions relating to public education. The Ohio provisions (R. 260) are
noteworthy for the strong stand for religious freedom and against any
discrimination in the schools between rich and poor, while the Indiana
provisions (R. 261) are marked for their broad and generous conception of
the scope and purpose of a state system of public instruction.

Many of the older States enacted general state school laws early in their
history (R. 262). Connecticut continued the general school laws of 1700,
1712, and 1714 unchanged, and in 1795 added $1,200,000, derived from land
sales, to a permanent state school endowment fund, created as early as
1750. Vermont enacted a general school law in 1782. Massachusetts and New
Hampshire enacted new general school laws, in 1789, which restated and
legalized the school development of the preceding hundred and fifty years.
All these required the maintenance of schools by the towns for a definite
term each year, ordered taxation, and fixed the school studies required by
the State. New York, in 1784, created an administrative organization,
known as the University of the State of New York, to supervise secondary
and higher education throughout the State--an institution clearly modeled
after the centralizing ideas of Condorcet, Rolland, and Diderot (p. 477),
and very similar to the ideas proposed by Talleyrand and Condorcet and
later (1808) embodied in the University of France by Napoleon. In 1795 New
York also provided for a state system of elementary education. Georgia
created a state system of academies, as early as 1783. Delaware created a
state school fund, in 1796, and Virginia enacted an optional school law
the same year. North Carolina created a state university, as early as
1795.

THE NEW POLITICAL MOTIVE FOR SCHOOLS. We thus see, in the new United
States, the theories of the French revolutionary thinkers and statesmen
actually being realized in practice. The constitutional provisions, and
even the legislation, often were in advance of what the States,
impoverished as they were by the War of Independence, could at once carry
out, but they mark the evolution in America of a clearly defined state
theory as to education, and the recognition of a need for general
education in a government whose actions were so largely influenced by the
force of public opinion. The Federal Constitution had extended the right
to vote for national officers to all, and the older States soon began to
remove their earlier property qualifications for voting and to extend
general manhood suffrage to all citizens.

This new development in government by the people, which meant the passing
of the rule of a propertied and educated class and the establishment of a
real democracy, caused the leading American statesmen to turn early to
general education as a necessity for republican safety. In his Farewell
Address to the American people, written in 1796, Washington said:

    Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for
    the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of
    a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that
    public opinion should be enlightened.

Jefferson spent the years 1784 to 1789 in Paris, and became a great
propagandist in America for French political ideas. Writing to James
Madison from France, as early as 1787, he said:

    Above all things, I hope the education of the common people will be
    attended to; convinced that on this good sense we may rely with the
    most security for the preservation of a due sense of liberty.

[Illustration: FIG. 162. THOMAS JEFFERSON (1743-1826)]

In 1779, then, as a member of the Virginia legislature, Jefferson tried
unsuccessfully to secure the passage of a comprehensive bill, after the
plan of the French Revolutionary proposals, for the organization of a
complete system of public education for Virginia. The essential features
of the proposed bill (R. 263) were that every county should be laid off
into school districts, five to six miles square, to be known as
"hundreds," and in each of these an elementary school was to be
established to which any citizen could send his children free of charge
for three years, and as much longer as he was willing to pay tuition; that
the leading pupil in each school was to be selected annually and sent to
one of twenty grammar (secondary) schools to be established and maintained
at various points in the State; after two years the leaders in each of
these schools were to be selected and further educated free for six years,
the less promising being sent home; and at the completion of the grammar-
school course, the upper half of the pupils were to be given three years
more of free education at the State College of William and Mary, and the
other half were to be employed as teachers for the schools of the State.
[13]

Though the scheme failed of approval, Jefferson never lost interest in the
education of the people for intelligent participation in the functions of
government. Writing from Monticello to Colonel Yancey, in 1816, after his
retirement from the presidency, he wrote:

    If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization
    it expects what never was and never will be.... There is no safe
    deposit (for the functions of government) but with the people
    themselves; nor can they be safe with them without information.

In 1819 the founding of the University of Virginia crowned Jefferson's
efforts for education by the State. This institution, the Declaration of
Independence, and the statute for religious freedom in Virginia stand to-
day as the three enduring monuments to his memory. [14]

Other of the early American statesmen expressed similar views as to the
importance of general education by the State. John Jay, first Chief
Justice of the United States, in a letter to his friend, Dr. Benjamin
Rush, wrote:

    I consider knowledge to be the soul of a Republic, and as the weak and
    the wicked are generally in alliance, as much care should be taken to
    diminish the number of the former as of the latter. Education is the
    way to do this, and nothing should be left undone to afford all ranks
    of people the means of obtaining a proper degree of it at a cheap and
    easy rate.

James Madison, fourth President of the United States, wrote:

    A satisfactory plan for primary education is certainly a vital
    desideratum in our republics.

    A popular government without popular information or the means of
    acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or, perhaps,
    both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean
    to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which
    knowledge gives.

John Adams, with true New England thoroughness, expressed the new motive
for education still more forcibly when he wrote:

    The instruction of the people in every kind of knowledge that can be
    of use to them in the practice of their moral duties as men, citizens,
    and Christians, and of their political and civil duties as members of
    society and freemen, ought to be the care of the public, and of all
    who have any share in the conduct of its affairs, in a manner that
    never yet has been practiced in any age or nation. The education here
    intended is not merely that of the children of the rich and noble, but
    of every rank and class of people, down to the lowest and poorest. It
    is not too much to say that schools for the education of all should be
    placed at convenient distances and maintained at the public expense.
    The revenues of the State would be applied infinitely better, more
    charitably, wisely, usefully, and therefore politically in this way
    than even in maintaining the poor. This would be the best way of
    preventing the existence of the poor....

    Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower
    classes of people, are so extremely wise and useful that, to a humane
    and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought
    extravagant.

Having founded, as Lincoln so well said later at Gettysburg, "on this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal," and having built a
constitutional form of government based on that equality, it in time
became evident to those who thought at all on the question that that
liberty and political equality could not be preserved without the general
education of all. A new motive for education was thus created and
gradually formulated in the United States, as well as in revolutionary
France, and the nature of the school instruction of the youth of the State
came in time to be colored through and through by this new political
motive. The necessary schools, though, did not come at once. On the
contrary, the struggle to establish these necessary schools it will be our
purpose to trace in subsequent chapters, but before doing so we wish first
to point out how the rise of a political theory for education led to the
development of a theory as to the nature of the educational process which
exercised a far-reaching influence on all subsequent evolution of schools
and teaching.

CHAPTER XXI

A NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL


In chapters XVII and XVIII we traced the development of educational theory
up to the point where John Locke left it after outlining his social and
disciplinary theory for the educational process, and in the chapter
preceding this one we traced the evolution of a new state theory as to the
purpose of education to replace the old religious theory. The new theory
as to state control, and the erection of a citizenship purpose for
education, made it both possible and desirable that the instruction in the
school, and particularly in the vernacular school, should be recast, both
in method and content, to bring the school into harmony with the new
secular purpose. In consequence, an important reorganization of the
vernacular school now took place, and to this transformation of the
elementary school we next turn.


I. THE NEW THEORY STATED

ICONOCLASTIC NATURE OF THE WORK OF ROUSSEAU. The inspirer of the new
theory as to the purpose of education was none other than the French-Swiss
iconoclast and political writer, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work as a
political theorist we have previously described. Canton tells of an imaginary
poem written by an imaginary Arm.
(Arminius?), Altegans, an elderly German cobbler of 'the village of Wieheisstes,
in the pleasant crag-and-fir region of Schlaraffenland.' Its name
is the 'Erster Schulgang,' and I will own, and gratefully, that few
real poems by real 'classics' have so sung themselves into my ears,
or so shamed the dulness out of drudgery, as have the passages which I here
set down for the mere pleasure of transcribing them:--

"The poem opens with a wonderful vision of children; delightful as it is
unexpected; as romantic in presentment as it is commonplace in fact.

    All over the world--and all under it, too, when their time comes--the
    children are trooping to school. The great globe swings round out of
    the dark into the sun; there is always morning somewhere; and for
    ever in this shifting region of the morning-light the good Altegans
    sees the little ones afoot--shining companies and groups, couples,
    and bright solitary figures; for they all seem to have a soft heavenly
    light about them!

"He sees them in country lanes and rustic villages; on lonely moorlands,
where narrow, brown foot-tracks thread the expanse of green waste, and
occasionally a hawk hovers overhead, or the mountain ash hangs its scarlet
berries above the huge fallen stones set up by the Druids in the old days;
he sees them on the hill-sides, in the woods, on the stepping-stones that
cross the brook in the glen, along the sea-cliffs and on the wet
ribbed sands; trespassing on the railway lines, making short cuts through
the corn, sitting in ferry-boats: he sees them in the crowded streets of
smoky cities, in small rocky islands, in places far inland where the sea
is known only as a strange tradition.

"The morning-side of the planet is alive with them; one hears their pattering
footsteps everywhere. And as the vast continents sweep 'eastering out
of the high shadow which reaches beyond the moon,' and as new nations
with _their_ cities and villages, their fields, woods, mountains,
and sea-shores, rise up into the morning-side, lo!

Fresh troops, and still fresh troops, and yet again fresh troops
of 'these small school-going children of the dawn.' . . .

"What are weather and season to this incessant panorama of childhood?
The pigmy people trudge through the snow on moor and hill-side; wade down
flooded roads; are not to be daunted by wind or rain, frost or the white
smother of 'millers and bakers at fisticuffs.' Most beautiful of all, he
sees them travelling schoolward by that late moonlight which now and
again in the winter months precedes the tardy dawn."
My birthday falls in November month. Here, behind this Cornish window, we
are careful in our keeping of birthdays; we observe them solemnly, stringent
in our cheerful ritual;--and this has been my birthday sermon!

DECEMBER.

Hard by the edge of the sand-hills, and close beside the high road on
the last rise before it dips to the coast, stands a turfed embankment
surrounded by a shallow fosse. This is none of our ancient camps
('castles' we call them in Cornwall), as you perceive upon stepping
within the enclosure, which rises in a complete circle save for two
entrances cut through the bank and facing one another.

    You are standing in a perfectly level area a hundred and thirty
feet in diameter; the surrounding rampart rises to a height of eight
or nine feet, narrowing towards the top, where it is seven feet
wide; and around its inner side you may trace seven or eight rows
of seats cut in the turf, but now almost obliterated by the grass.

    This Round (as we call it) was once an open-air theatre or
       planguary (_plain-an-guare_, place of the play).

    It has possibly a still older history, and may have been used by
       the old Cornish for their councils and rustic sports; but we know
       that it was used as a theatre, perhaps as early as the fourteenth
century, certainly as late as the late sixteenth: and, what is more,
we have preserved for us some of the plays performed in it.

    They are sacred or miracle plays, of course.

    If you draw a line from entrance to entrance, then at right angles
       to it there runs from the circumference towards the centre of the
area a straight shallow trench, terminating in a spoon-shaped pit.

    The trench is now a mere depression not more than a foot
       deep, the pit three feet: but doubtless time has levelled them up,
and there is every reason to suppose that the pit served to represent
Hell (or, in the drama of The Resurrection, the Grave), and the
trench allowed the performers, after being thrust down into perdition,
to regain the green-room unobserved--either actually unobserved,
the trench being covered, or by a polite fiction, the audience
pretending not to see.

    My private belief is that, the stage being erected above and along
       the trench, they were actually hidden while they made their exit.

    Where the trench meets the rampart a semi-circular hollow, about ten
       feet in diameter, makes a breach in the rows of seats.

    Here, no doubt, stood the green-room.
       

   The first notice of the performance of these plays occurs in Carew's
       _Survey of Cornwall_, published in 1602:--
       "Pastimes to delight the mind, the Cornishmen have guary miracles
and three-men's songs: and for exercise of the body hunting, hawking,
shooting, wrestling, hurling, and such other games.

   "The guary miracle, in English a miracle play, is a kind of
       Interlude compiled in Cornish out of some scripture history with
       that grossness which accompanied the Romans' _vetus comedia_.

   For representing it they raise an earthen amphitheatre in some open
       field, having the diameter of this inclosed plain some forty or fifty
       foot.

   The country people flock from all sides, many miles off, to hear and see
       it; for they have therein devils and devices to delight as well
       the eye as the ear; the players con not their parts without book,
but are prompted by one called the Ordinary, who followeth at their
back with the book in his hand and telleth them softly what they
must pronounce aloud."

   Our Round, you observe, greatly exceeds the dimensions given
       by Carew.
       But there were several in the west: one for instance, traceable
fifty years ago, at the northern end of the town of Redruth, which
still keeps the name of Planguary; and another magnificent one, of
stone, near the church-town of St.

Just by the Land's End. Carew may have seen only the smaller specimens.

As for the plays--well, they are by no means masterpieces of literature, yet
they reveal here and there perceptions of beauty such as go with sincerity
even though it be artless. Beautiful for instance is the idea, if primitive
the writing, of a scene in one, _Origo Mundi_, where Adam, bowed with
years, sends his son Seth to the gate of Paradise to beg his
release from the weariness of living (I quote from Norris's translation):--

"O dear God, I am weary, Gladly would I see once The time to depart.
Strong are the roots of the briars, That my arms are broken Tearing up many
of them.

"Seth my son I will send To the gate of Paradise forthwith, To the Cherub,
the guardian.

Ask him if there will be for me Oil of mercy at the last From the Father,
the God of Grace."
Seth answers that he does not know the road to Paradise. "Follow," says
Adam--
"Follow the prints of my feet, burnt; No grass or flower in the world
grows In that same road where I went-- I and thy Mother surely
also-- Thou wilt see the tokens."
Fine too is the story, in the _Passio Domini Nostri_, of the blind soldier
Longius, who is led forward and given a lance, to pierce Christ's body
on the Cross. He thrusts and the holy blood heals him of his blindness.
Local colour is sparingly imported. One of the executioners, as he
bores the Cross, says boastfully:--
"I will bore a hole for the one hand, There is not a fellow west of Hayle
Who can bore better."
--And in the _Resurrectio_ Pilate rewards the gaoler for his
trustiness with the Cornish manors of 'Fekenal, Carvenow and Merthyn,'
and promises the soldiers by the Sepulchre 'the plain of Dansotha
and Barrow Heath.'

A simplicity scarcely less refreshing is exhibited in _The Life of
St.

Meriasec_ (a play recently recovered) by a scholar whom a pompous pedagogue
is showing off. He says:--
"God help A, B, and C!
The end of the song is D:
No more is known to me,"
But promises to learn more after dinner.

Enthusiasts beg us to make the experiment of 'reviving' these old plays
in their old surroundings. But here I pause, while admitting the temptation.

One would like to give life again, if only for a day, to the picture
which Mr.

    Norris conjures up:--
    "The bare granite plain of St. Just, in view of Cape Cornwall and
    of the transparent sea which beats against that magnificent headland.
    . . . The mighty gathering of people from many miles around hardly
    showing like a crowd in that extended region, where nothing ever
    grows to limit the view on any side, with their booths and tents,
    absolutely necessary where so many people had to remain three days
    on the spot, would give a character to the assembly probably more
    like what we hear of the so-called religious revivals in America
    than of anything witnessed in more sober Europe."
    But alas! I foresee the terrible unreality which would infect the whole
    business. Very pretty, no doubt, and suggestive would be the picture
    of the audience arrayed around the turf benches--
    "In gradibus sedit populus de cespite factis--"
    But one does not want an audience to be acting; and this audience would
    be making-believe even more heroically than the actors--that is,
if it took the trouble to be in earnest at all.

For the success of the experiment would depend on our reconstructing the
whole scene--the ring of entranced spectators as well as the primitive
show; and the country-people would probably, and not entirely without
reason, regard the business as 'a stupid old May game.' The only spectators
properly impressed would be a handful of visitors and solemn antiquarians.
I can see those visitors.
If it has ever been your lot to witness the performance of a 'literary'
play in London and cast an eye over the audience it attracts, you too will
know them and their stigmata--their ineffable attire, their strange
hirsuteness, their air of combining instruction with amusement,
their soft felt hats indented along the crown.

No!

We may, perhaps, produce new religious dramas in these ancient Rounds:
decidedly we cannot revive the old ones.

While I ponder these things, standing in the deserted Round, there comes
to me--across the sky where the plovers wheel and flash in the wintry
sunshine--the sound of men's voices carolling at an unseen farm. They are
singing _The First Nowell_; but the fourth Nowell--the fourth of the
refrain--is the _clou_ of that most common, most excellent carol, and
gloriously the tenors and basses rise to it. No, we cannot revive the old
Miracle Plays: but here in the Christmas Carols we have something as artlessly
beautiful which we can still preserve, for with them we have not to revive,
but merely to preserve, the conditions.

In a preface to a little book of carols chosen (and with good judgment)
some years ago by the Rev. H. R. Bramley, of Magdalen College, Oxford, and
well edited in the matter of music by Sir John Stainer, I read that--
"The time-honoured and delightful custom of thus celebrating the
Birthday of the Holy Child seems, with some change of form, to be
steadily and rapidly gaining ground.

Instead of the itinerant ballad-singer, or the little bands of wandering
children, the practice of singing carols in Divine Service, or by a
full choir at some fixed meeting, is becoming prevalent."
Since Mr. Bramley wrote these words the practice has grown more prevalent,
and the shepherds of Bethlehem are in process of becoming thoroughly
sophisticated and self-conscious. For that is what it means. You may
(as harassed bishops will admit) do a number of irrelevant things in church,
but you cannot sing the best carols there. You cannot toll in your congregation,
seat your organist at the organ, array your full choir in
surplices, and tune up to sing, for example--
"Rise up, rise up, brother Dives, And come along with me; There's a
place in Hell prepared for you To sit on the serpent's knee."
Or this--
"In a manger laid and wrapped I was-- So very poor, this was my chance--
Between an ox and a silly poor ass, To call my true love to the
dance."
Or this--
"Joseph did whistle and Mary did sing, And all the bells on earth did
ring On Christmas Day in the morning."

These are verses from carols, and from excellent carols: but I protest that
with 'choirs and places where they sing' they will be found incongruous.
Indeed, Mr. Bramley admits it. Of his collection "some," he says, "from
their legendary, festive or otherwise less serious character, are
unfit for use within the church."
Now since, as we know, these old carols were written to be sung in the open
air, or in the halls and kitchens of private houses, I prefer to put Mr.
Bramley's proposition conversely, and say that the church is an unsuitable
place for carol singing. If the clergy persist in so confining it, they
will no doubt in process of time evolve a number of new compositions
which differ from ordinary hymns sufficiently to be called carols,
but from which the peculiar charm of the carol has evaporated.
This charm (let me add) by no means consists in mere primitiveness or mere
archaism. Genuine carols (if we could only get rid of affectation and be
honest authors in our own century without straining to age ourselves
back into the fifteenth) might be written to-day as appropriately as
ever.
'Joseph did whistle,' &c., was no less unsuited at the date of its
composition to performance by a full choir in a chancel than it is to-day.

But whatever the precise nature of the charm may be, you can prove by a
very simple experiment that such a performance tends to impair it.
Assemble a number of carollers about your doorstep or within your hall, and
listen to their rendering of 'The first good joy,' or 'The angel
Gabriel;' then take them off to church and let them sing these same
ditties to an organ accompaniment.

You will find that, strive against it as they may, the tune drags slower
and slower; the poem has become a spiritless jingle, at once dismal and
trivial. Take the poor thing out into the fresh air again and revive it
with a fife and drum; stay it with flagons and comfort it with apples, for
it is sick of improper feeding.

No, no: such a carol as 'God rest you, merry gentlemen,' has a note which
neither is suited by, nor can be suited to, what people call 'the sacred
edifice': while 'Joseph was an old man,' 'I saw three ships' and 'The
first good joy' are plainly impossible. Associate them with organ and
surpliced choir, and you are mixing up things that differ.

Omit them, at the same time banning the house-to-house caroller,
and you tyrannically limit men's devotional impulses.

I am told that the clergy frown upon house-to-house carolling, because
they believe it encourages drunkenness.
Why then, let them take the business in hand and see that too much drink is
neither taken nor offered. This ought not to be very difficult.
But, as with the old plays, so with carol-singing, it is easier and more
consonant with the Puritan temper to abolish a practice than to elevate
it and clear away abuses: and the half-instructed mind is taught
with fatal facility to condemn use and abuse in a lump, to believe
carol-singing a wile of the Evil One because Bill once went around
carol-singing and came home drunk.

    In parishes where a more tolerant spirit prevails I am glad to note
    that the old custom, and even a taste for the finer ditties, seem to
    be reviving. Certainly the carollers visit us in greater numbers and
    sing with more evidence of careful practice than they did eight or
    ten years ago: and friends in various parts of England have a like
    story to tell.
    In this corner the rigour of winter does not usually begin before
    January, and it is no unusual thing to be able to sit out of doors
    in sunshine for an hour or so in the afternoon of Christmas Day.
    The vessels in sight fly their flags and carry bunches of
    holly at their topmast-heads: and I confess the day is made
    cheerfuller for us if they are answered by the voices of carollers
    on the waterside, or if, walking inland, I hear the note of the clarionet
    in some 'town-place' or meet a singing-party tramping between farm
and farm.

That the fresh bloom of the carol was evanescent and all too easily
destroyed I always knew; but never realised its extreme fugacity
until, some five years ago, it fell to me to prepare an anthology, which,
under the title of _The Oxford Book of English Verse_, has since achieved
some popularity. I believed that previous English anthologists had unjustly,
even unaccountably, neglected our English carols, and promised myself to
redress the balance. I hunted through many collections, and brought
together a score or so of pieces which, considered merely as carols,
were gems of the first water. But no sooner did I set them among our finer
lyrics than, to my dismay, their colours vanished; the juxtaposition
became an opposition which killed them, and all but half a dozen had to
be withdrawn. There are few gems more beautiful than the amethyst: but an
amethyst will not live in the company of rubies. A few held their
own-- the exquisite 'I sing of a Maiden' for instance--
"I sing of a Maiden That is makeles;[1] King of all kings To her son she
ches.[2]
"He came al so still There his mother was, As dew in April That falleth on
the grass.

"He came al so still To his mother's bour, As dew in April That falleth
on the flour.

"He came al so still There his mother lay As dew in April That falleth on
the spray.

"Mother and maiden Was never none but she; Well may such a lady Goddes
mother be."
[1] Without a mate.

[2] Chose.

Or 'Lestenyt, lordings,' or 'Of one that is so fair and bright;' and my
favourite, 'The Seven Virgins,' set among the ballads lost none of its
lovely candour. But on the whole, and sorely against my will, it had
to be allowed that our most typical carols will not bear an ordeal
through which many of the rudest ballads pass safely enough. So it will
be found, I suspect, with the carols of other nations. I take a typical
English one, exhumed not long ago by Professor Flugel from a sixteenth
century MS.
at Balliol College, Oxford, and pounced upon as a gem by two such
excellent judges of poetry as Mr.

Alfred W. Pollard and Mr. F. Sidgwick:--
"_Can I not sing but Hoy!
The jolly shepherd made so much joy!_ The shepherd upon a hill he sat,
He had on him his tabard[1] and his hat, His tar-box, his pipe and his
flagat;[2] And his name was called jolly, jolly Wat, For he was a good
herd's-boy, Ut hoy!
For in his pipe he made so much joy."
"The shepherd upon a hill was laid His dog to his girdle was tayd,
He had not slept but a little braid But _Gloria in excelsis_ was
to him said Ut hoy!
For in his pipe he made so much joy.
"The shepherd on a hill he stood, Round about him his sheep they
yode,[3] He put his hand under his hood, He saw a star as red as
blood.It was an attempt to regenerate beggars by means of education,
which Pestalozzi firmly believed could be done. At the end of two years he
had spent all the money he and his wife possessed, and the school closed
in failure--a blessing in disguise--though with Pestalozzi's faith in the
power of education unshaken. Of this experiment he wrote: "For years I
have lived in the midst of fifty little beggars, sharing in my poverty my
bread with them, living like a beggar myself in order to teach beggars to
live like men."

Turning next to writing, while continuing to farm, Pestalozzi now tried to
express his faith in education in printed form. His _Leonard and Gertrude_
(1781) was a wonderfully beautiful story of Swiss peasant life, and of the
genius and sympathy and love of a woman amid degrading surroundings. From
a wretched place the village of Bonnal, under Pestalozzi's pen, was
transformed by the power of education. [7] The book was a great success
from the first, and for it Pestalozzi was made a "citizen" of the French
Republic, along with Washington, Madison, Kosciusko, Wilberforce, and Tom
Paine. He continued to farm and to think, though nearly starving, until
1798, when the opportunity for which he was really fitted came.

PESTALOZZI'S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENTS. In 1798 "The Helvetic Republic" was
proclaimed, an event which divided Pestalozzi's life into two parts. Up to
this time he had been interested wholly in the philanthropic aspect of
education, believing that the poor could be regenerated through education
and labor. From this time on he interested himself in the teaching aspect
of the problem, in the working-out and formulation of a teaching method
based on the natural development of the child, and in training others to
teach. Much to the disgust of the authorities of the new Swiss Government,
citizen Pestalozzi applied for service as a schoolteacher. The opportunity
to render such service soon came.

That autumn the French troops invaded Switzerland, and, in putting down
the stubborn resistance of the three German cantons, shot down a large
number of the people. Orphans to the number of 169 were left in the little
town of Stanz, and citizen Pestalozzi was given charge of them. For six
months he was father, mother, teacher, and nurse. Then, worn out himself,
the orphanage was changed into a hospital. A little later he became a
schoolmaster in Burgdorf; was dismissed; became a teacher in another
school; and finally, in 1800, opened a school himself in an old castle
there. He now drew about him other teachers interested in improving
instruction, and in consequence could specialize the work. He provided
separate teachers for drawing and singing, geography and history, language
and arithmetic, and gymnastics. The year following the school was enlarged
into a teachers' training-school, the government extending him aid in
return for giving Swiss teachers one month of training as teachers in his
school. Here he wrote and published _How Gertrude teaches her Children_,
which explained his methods and forms his most important pedagogical work
(R. 267); a _Guide for teaching Spelling and Reading_; and a _Book for
Mothers_, devoted to a description of "object teaching." In 1803, the
castle being needed by the government, Pestalozzi moved first to
Munchenbuchsee, near Hofwyl, opening his Institute temporarily in an old
convent there. For a few months, in 1804, he was associated with Emanuel
von Fellenberg, at Hofwyl (p. 546), but in October, 1804, he moved to
Yverdon, where he reëstablished the Institute, and where the next twenty
years of his life were spent and his greatest success achieved.

[Illustration: FIG. 166. THE SCENE OF PESTALOZZI'S LABORS]

THE CONTRIBUTION OF PESTALOZZI. The great contribution of Pestalozzi lay
in that, following the lead of Rousseau, he rejected the religious aim and
the teaching of mere words and facts, which had characterized all
elementary education up to near the close of the eighteenth century, and
tried instead to reduce the educational process to a well-organized
routine, based on the natural and orderly development of the instincts,
capacities, and powers of the growing child. Taking Rousseau's idea of a
return to nature, he tried to apply it to the education of children. This
led to his rejection of what he called the "empty chattering of mere
words" and "outward show" in the instruction in reading and the catechism,
and the introduction in their place of real studies, based on observation,
experimentation, and reasoning. "Sense impression" became his watchword.
[8] As he expressed it, he "tried to organize and psychologize the
educational process" by harmonizing it with the natural development of the
child (R. 267). To this end he carefully studied children, and developed
his methods experimentally as a result of his observation. To this end,
both at Burgdorf and Yverdon, all results of preceding teachers and
writers on education were rejected, for fear that error might creep in.
Read nothing, discover everything, and prove all things, came to be the
working guides of himself and his teachers.

The development of man he believed to be organic, and to proceed according
to law. It was the work of the teacher to discover these laws of
development and to assist nature in securing "a natural, symmetrical, and
harmonious development" of all the "faculties" of the child. Real
education must develop the child as a whole--mentally, physically,
morally--and called for the training of the head and the hand and the
heart. The only proper means for developing the powers of the child was
use, and hence education must guide and stimulate self-activity, be based
on intuition and exercise, and the sense impressions must be organized and
directed. Education, too, if it is to follow the organic development of
the child, must observe the proper progress of child development and be
graded, so that each step of the process shall grow out of the preceding
and grow into the following stage. To accomplish these ends the training
must be all-round and harmonious; much liberty must be allowed the child
in learning; education must proceed largely by doing instead of by words,
the method of learning must be largely analytical; real objects and ideas
must precede symbols and words; and, finally, the organization and
correlation of what is learned must be looked after by the teacher.

[Illustration: PLATE II. JOHANN HEINRICH PESTALOZZI.]

Still more, Pestalozzi possessed a deep and abiding faith, new at the
time, in the power of education as a means of regenerating society. He had
begun his work by trying to "teach beggars to live like men," and his
belief in the potency of education in working this transformation, so
touchingly expressed in his _Leonard and Gertrude_, never left him. He
believed that each human being could be raised through the influence of
education to the level of an intellectually free and morally independent
life, and that every human being was entitled to the right to attain such
freedom and independence. The way to this lay through the full use of his
developing powers, under the guidance of a teacher, and not through a
process of repeating words and learning by heart. Not only the
intellectual qualities of perception, judgment, and reasoning need
exercise, but the moral powers as well. To provide such exercise and
direction was the work of the school.

Pestalozzi also resented the brutal discipline which for ages had
characterized all school instruction, believed it by its very nature
immoral, and tried to substitute for this a strict but loving discipline--
a "thinking love," he calls it--and to make the school as nearly as
possible like a gentle and refined home. To a Swiss father, who on
visiting his school exclaimed, "Why, this is not a school, but a family,"
Pestalozzi answered that such a statement was the greatest praise he could
have given him.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE IDEAS. The educational consequences of these new
ideas were very large. They in time gave aim and purpose to the elementary
school of the nineteenth century, transforming it from an instrument of
the Church for church ends, to an instrument of society to be used for its
own regeneration and the advancement of the welfare of all. [9] The
introduction of the study of natural objects in place of words, and much
talking about what was seen and studied instead of parrot-like
reproductions of the words of a book, revolutionized both the methods and
the subject-matter of instruction in the developing elementary school.
Observation and investigation tended to supersede mere memorizing; class
discussion and thinking to supersede the reciting of the words of the
book; thinking about what was being done to supersede routine learning;
and class instruction to supersede the wasteful individual teaching which
had for so long characterized all school work. It meant the reorganization
of the work of the vernacular school on a modern basis, with class
organization and group instruction, and a modern-world purpose (R. 269).

The work of Pestalozzi also meant the introduction of new subject-matter
for instruction, the organization of new teaching subjects for the
elementary school, and the redirection of the elementary education of
children. Observation led to the development of elementary-science study,
and the study of home geography; talking about what was observed led to
the study of language usage, as distinct from the older study of grammar;
and counting and measuring led to the study of number, and hence to a new
type of primary arithmetic. The reading of the school also changed both in
character and purpose. In other words, in place of an elementary education
based on reading, a little writing and spelling, and the catechism, all of
a memoriter type and with religious ends in view, a new primary school,
essentially secular in character, was created by the work of Pestalozzi.
This new school was based on the study of real objects, learning through
sense impressions, the individual expression of ideas, child activity, and
the development of the child's powers in an orderly way. In fact, "the
development of the faculties" of the child became a by-word with
Pestalozzi and his followers.

Pestalozzi's deep abiding faith in the power of education to regenerate
society was highly influential in Switzerland, throughout western Europe,
and later in America in showing how to deal with orphans, vagrants, and
those suffering from physical defects or in need of reformation, by
providing for such a combination of intellectual and industrial training.

THE SPREAD AND INFLUENCE OF PESTALOZZI'S WORK. So famous did the work of
Pestalozzi become that his schools at Burgdorf and Yverdon came to be
"show places," even in a land filled with natural wonders. Observers and
students came from America (R. 268) and from all over Europe to see and to
teach in his school, and draw inspiration from seeing his work (R. 270)
and talking with him. [10] In particular the educators of Prussia were
attracted by his work, and, earlier than other nations, saw the far-
reaching significance of his discoveries. Herbart visited his school as
early as 1799, when but a young man of twenty-three, and wrote a very
sympathetic description of his new methods. Froebel spent the years 1808
to 1810 as a teacher at Yverdon, when he was a young man of twenty-six to
eight. "It soon became evident to me," wrote Froebel, "that 'Pestalozzi'
was to be the watchword of my life." The philosopher Fichte, whose
Addresses (1807-08) on the condition of the German people (page 568),
after their humiliating defeat by Napoleon, did much to reveal to Prussia
the possibilities of national regeneration by means of education, had
taught in Zurich, knew Pestalozzi, and afterward exploited his work and
his ideas in Berlin. [11] As early as 1803 an envoy, sent by the Prussian
King, [12] reported favorably on Pestalozzi's work, and in 1804
Pestalozzian methods were authorized for the primary schools of Prussia.
In 1808 seventeen teachers were sent to Switzerland, at the expense of the
Prussian Government, to spend three years in studying Pestalozzi's ideas
and methods. On their return, these and others spread Pestalozzian ideas
throughout Prussia. A pastor and teacher from Würtemberg, Karl August
Zeller (1774-1847), came to Burgdorf in 1803 to study. In 1806 he opened a
training-school for teachers in Zurich, and there worked out a plan of
studies based on the work of Pestalozzi. This was printed and attracted
much attention. In 1808 the King of Würtemberg listened to five lectures
on Pestalozzian methods by Zeller, and invited him to a position as school
inspector in his State. Before he had done but a few months' work he was
called to Prussia, to organize a normal school and begin the introduction
of Pestalozzian ideas there. From Prussia the ideas and methods of
Pestalozzi gradually spread to the other German States.

Many Swiss teachers were trained by Pestalozzi, and these also helped to
extend his work and ideas over Switzerland. Particularly in German
Switzerland did his ideas take root and reorganize education. As a result
modern systems of education made an early start in these cantons. One of
Pestalozzi's earliest and most faithful teachers, Hermann Krüsi, became
principal of the Swiss normal school at Gais, and trained teachers there
in Pestalozzian methods. Zeller's pupils, too, did much to spread his
influence among the Swiss. Pestalozzi's ideas were also carried to
England, but in no such satisfactory manner as to the German States. Where
German lands received both the method and the spirit, the English obtained
largely the form. Later Pestalozzian ideas came to the United States, at
first largely through English sources, and, after about 1860, resulted in
a thoroughgoing reorganization of American elementary education.

After Pestalozzi's institution had become celebrated, and visitors and
commissions from many countries had visited him and it, and after
governments had vied with one another in introducing Pestalozzian methods
and reforms, the vogue of the Pestalozzian ideas became very extended.
Many excellent private schools were founded on the Pestalozzian model,
while on the other hand self-styled Pestalozzian reformers sprang up on
all sides. All this imitation was both natural and helpful; the
foolishness and charlatanism in time disappeared, leaving a real advance
in the educational conception.

THE MANUAL-LABOR SCHOOL OF FELLENBERG. Of the Swiss associates and
followers of Pestalozzi one of the most influential was Phillip Emanuel
von Fellenberg (1771-1844). The son of a Swiss official of high political
and social position, possessed of wealth, having traveled extensively,
Fellenberg, having become convinced that correct early education was the
only means whereby the State might be elevated and the lot of man made
better, resolved (1805) to devote his life and his fortune to the working-
out of his ideas. For a short time associated with Pestalozzi, he soon
withdrew and established, on his own estate, an Institution which later
(1829) came to comprise the following:

    1. A farm of about six hundred acres.

    2. Workshops for manufacturing clothing and tools.

    3. A printing and lithographing establishment.

    4. A literary institution for the education of the well-to-do.

    5. A lower or _real_ school, which trained for handicrafts and
       middle-class occupations.

    6. An agricultural school for the education of the poor as farm
       laborers, and as teachers for the rural schools.

[Illustration: PLATE 12: FELLENBERG'S INSTITUTE AT HOFWYL.
The first Agricultural and Mechanical College. This school contained the
germ-idea of all our agricultural education.]

By 1810 the Institution had begun to attract attention, and soon pupils
and visitors came from distant lands to study in and to examine the
schools. The agricultural school in particular aroused interest. More than
one hundred Reports (R. 272) were published, in Europe and America, on
this very successful experiment in a combined intellectual and manual-
labor type of education. Fellenberg died in 1844, and his family
discontinued the school in 1848.

Fellenberg's work was a continuation of the social-regeneration conception
of education held by Pestalozzi, and contained the germ-idea of all our
agricultural and industrial education. His plan was widely copied in
Switzerland, Germany, England, and the United States. It was well suited
to the United States because of the very democratic conditions then
prevailing among an agricultural people possessed of but little wealth.
The plan of combining farming and schooling made for a time a strong
appeal to Americans, and such schools were founded in many parts of the
country. The idea at first was to unite training in agriculture with
schooling, but it was soon extended to the rapidly rising mechanical
pursuits as well. Only do not forbid the poet to speak and enforce the moral
conviction that is in him.

If, on the other hand, politics be a mere affair of casuistry; or worse--a
mere game of opportunism in which he excels who hits on the cleverest
expedient for each several crisis as it occurs; then indeed you may
bid the poet hush the voice of principle, and listen only to the
sufficiently dissonant instruction of those specialists at the game
who make play in Parliament and the press.

If politics be indeed that base thing connoted by the term "_drift_
of public affairs," then the axiom rests on wisdom after all.

The poet cannot be expected to understand the "drift," and had
better leave it to these specialists in drifting.

But if you search, you will find that poetry--rare gift as it is, and
understood by so few--has really been exerting an immense influence on
public opinion all the while that we have been deluged with assertions
of this unhappy axiom. Why, I dare to say that one-half of the
sense of Empire which now dominates political thought in Great Britain
has been the creation of her poets. The public, if it will but clear
its mind of cant, is grateful enough for such poetry as Mr. Kipling's
'Flag of England' and Mr. Henley's 'England, my England'; and
gratefully recognises that the spirit of these songs has passed on to
thousands of men, women, and children, who have never read a line
of Mr. Henley's or Mr. Kipling's composition.

As for the axiom, it is merely the complement of that 'Art for Art's sake'
chatter which died a dishonoured death but a short while ago, and
which it is still one of the joys of life to have outlived. You will remember
how loftily we were assured that Art had nothing to do with morality:
that the novelist, e.g. who composed tales of human conduct, had no concern
with ethics--that is to say with the principles of human conduct:
that "Art's only business was to satisfy Art," and so forth.

Well, it is all over now, and packed away in the rag-bag of out-worn
paradoxes; and we are left to enjoy the revived freshness of the simple
truth that an artist exists to serve his art, and his art to serve men and
women.

AUGUST.

As it was reported to me, the story went that one Sunday morning in August
a family stood in a window not far from this window of mine--the window
of an hotel coffee-room--and debated where to go for divine worship.
They were three: father, mother, and daughter, arrived the night before
from the Midlands, to spend their holiday. "The fisher-folk down here are
very religious," said the father, contemplating the anchored craft--
yachts, trading-steamers, merchantmen of various rigs and nationalities--
in which he supposed the native population to go a-fishing on week-days:

for he had been told in the Midlands that we were fisher-folk.
"Plymouth Brethren mostly, I suppose," said the wife: "we changed at
Plymouth." "Bristol."

"Was it Bristol? Well, Plymouth was the last big town we stopped at: I
am sure of _that_. And this is on the same coast, isn't it?" "What _are_
Plymouth Brethren?" the daughter asked.
"Oh, well, my dear, I expect they are very decent, earnest people.
It won't do us any harm to attend their service, if they have one.
What I say is, when you're away on holiday, do as the Romans do." The father
had been listening with an unprejudiced air, as who should say, "I
am here by the seaside for rest and enjoyment." He called to the
waiter, "What places of worship have you?" The waiter with professional
readiness hinted that he had some to suit all tastes, "Church of
England, Wesleyan, Congregational, Bible Christian--" "Plymouth Brethren?"
The waiter had never heard of them: they had not, at any rate, been asked
for within his recollection. He retired crestfallen. "That's the worst
of these waiters," the father explained: "they get 'em down for the season
from Lord knows where, Germany perhaps, and they can tell you nothing
of the place." "But this one is not a German, and he told me last
night he'd been here for years." "Well, the question is, Where we are
to go?
Here, Ethel,"--as a second daughter entered, buttoning her gloves--"your
mother can't make up her mind what place of worship to try." "Why, father,
how can you _ask?_ We must go to the Church, of course--I saw it from the
'bus--and hear the service in the fine old Cornish language."
Now, I suspect that the friend to whom I am indebted for this story introduced
a few grace-notes into his report. But it is a moral story in many
respects, and I give it for the sake of the one or two morals which
may be drawn from it.

In the first place, absurd as these people appear, their ignorance but differs
by a shade or two from the knowledge of certain very learned people
of my acquaintance. That is to say, they know about as much concerning
the religion of this corner of England to-day as the archaeologists, for
all their industry, know concerning the religion of Cornwall before it
became subject to the See of Canterbury in the reign of Athelstan, A.D.
925-40; and their hypotheses were constructed on much the same lines.
Nay, the resemblance in method and in the general muddle of conclusions
obtained would have been even more striking had these good persons mixed
up Plymouth Brethren (founded in 1830) with the Pilgrim Fathers who
sailed out of Plymouth in 1620, and are already undergoing the process of
mythopoeic conversion into Deucalions and Pyrrhas of the United States
of America. Add a slight confusion of their tenets with those of Mormonism,
or at least a disposition to lay stress on all discoverable points
of similarity between Puritans and Mormons, and really you have a not
unfair picture of the hopeless mess into which our researchers
in the ancient religions of Cornwall have honestly contrived to
plunge themselves and us.

It was better in the happy old days when we all believed in the
Druids; when the Druids explained everything, and my excellent
father grafted mistletoe upon his apple-trees--in vain, because
nothing will persuade the mistletoe to grow down here.

But nobody believes in the Druids just now: and the old question of
the Cassiterides has never been solved to general satisfaction: and the
Indian cowrie found in a barrow at Land's End, the tiny shell which
raised such a host of romantic conjectures and inspired Mr.

Canton to write his touching verses:--

"What year was it that blew The Aryan's wicker-work canoe Which brought the
shell to English land?

What prehistoric man or woman's hand, With what intent, consigned
it to this grave-- This barrow set in sound of the Ancient World's
last wave?"

"Beside it in the mound A charmed bead of flint was found.

Some woman surely in this place Covered with flowers a little baby-face,
And laid the cowrie on the cold dead breast; And, weeping, turned
for comfort to the landless West?"

"No man shall ever know.
It happened all so long ago That this same childless woman may Have
stood upon the cliffs around the bay And watched for tin-ships that
no longer came, Nor knew that Carthage had gone down in Roman flame."

This cowrie--are we even certain that it was Indian?--that it differed so
unmistakably from the cowries discoverable by twos and threes at
times on a little beach off which I cast anchor half a dozen times
every summer?

I speak as a man anxious to get at a little plain knowledge concerning the
land of his birth, and the researchers seem honestly unable to
give me any that does not tumble to pieces even in their own hands.

For--and this seems the one advance made--the researchers themselves are
honest nowadays.

Their results may be disappointing, but at least they no longer bemuse
themselves and us with the fanciful and even mystical speculations
their predecessors indulged in.

Take the case of our inscribed stones and wayside crosses.

Cornwall is peculiarly rich in these: of crosses alone it possesses more
than three hundred.

But when we make inquiry into their age we find ourselves in almost
complete fog. The merit of the modern inquirer (of Mr.

Langdon, for instance) is that he acknowledges the fog, and does not pretend
to guide us out of it by haphazard hypotheses propounded with
pontifical gravity and assurance--which was the way of that erratic
genius, the Rev.

R. S. Hawker:--

"Wheel-tracks in old Cornwall there were none, but there were
strange and narrow paths across the moorlands, which, the forefathers
said, in their simplicity, were first traced by Angels' feet.

  These, in truth, were trodden and worn by religious men:
  by the Pilgrim as he paced his way towards his chosen
  and votive bourne; or by the Palmer, whose
  listless footsteps had neither a fixed
  Kebla nor future abode.
  Dimly visible, by the darker hue of the crushed
  grass, these strait and narrow
  roads led the traveller along from one Hermitage to another
  Chapelry, or distant and inhabited cave; or the byeways turned
aside to reach some legendary spring, until at last, far, far away,
the winding track stood still upon the shore, where St.

Michael of the Mount rebuked the dragon from his throne of rock
above the seething sea.

But what was the wanderer's guide along the bleak unpeopled surface of the
Cornish moor? The Wayside Cross! . . ."

Very pretty, no doubt! but, unlike the Wayside Cross, this kind of writing
leads nowhere. We want Mr.

Hawker's authority for what 'the forefathers said, in their
simplicity'; without that, what the forefathers said resembles what
the soldier said in being inadmissible as evidence.

We want Mr.

Hawker's authority for saying that these paths '_in truth_, were trodden,
and worn by religious men.'

Nay we want his authority for saying that there were any paths at all! The
hypotheses of symbolism are even worse; for these may lead to
anything.

Mr.

Langdon was seriously told on one occasion that the four holes of a cross
represented the four evangelists.

"This," says he plaintively, "it will be admitted, is going a little too
far, as nothing else but four holes could be the result of a ring
and cross combined."

At Phillack, in the west of Cornwall, there is _part_ of a coped
stone having a rude cable mounting along the top of the ridge.

Two sapient young archaeologists counted the remaining notches of this
cable, and, finding they came to _thirty-two_, decided at once that they
represented our Lord's age!

They were quite certain, having counted them twice.

In fact, there seems to be nothing that symbolism will not prove. Do
    you meet with a pentacle? Its five points are
  the fingers of Omnipotence. With a six-pointed star? Then
Omnipotence has taken an extra finger,
to include the human nature of the Messiah: and so
on.
It reminds one of the Dilly Song:--
"I will sing you Five, O!" "What is your Five, O?" "Five it is the
Dilly Bird that's never seen but heard, O!"
  "I will sing you Six, O! . . ."
  And six is 'The Cherubim Watchers,' or 'The Crucifix,' or 'The Cheerful
    Waiters,' or 'The Ploughboys under the Bowl,' or whatever local
fancy may have hit on and made traditional.

The modern researcher is honest and sticks to facts; but there are
next to no facts.

And when he comes to a tentative conclusion, he must hedge it about
with so many 'ifs,' that practically he leaves us in total indecision.

Nothing, for instance, can exceed the patient industry displayed
in the late Mr.

William Copeland Borlase's _Age of the Saints_ --a monograph on Early
Christianity in Cornwall: but, in a way, no more hopeless book was ever
penned. The author confessed it, indeed, on his last page. "There
seems to be little ground for hope that we shall be ever able to gain a
perfectly true insight into the history of the epoch with which we have
attempted to deal, or to unravel the meshes of so tangled a web." He felt
his task, as he put it, to be not unlike that of gathering up the
broken pieces of pottery from some ancient tomb, with the hope of fitting
them together so as to make one large and perfect vase, but finding
during the process that they belong to several vessels, not one of which
is capable of restoration as a whole, though some faint notion of the
pristine shape of each may be gained from the general pattern and contour
of its shards. All that can be gained from the materials at hand is
a reasonable probability that Cornwall, before it bent its neck to the See
of Canterbury, had been invaded by three distinct streams of
missionary effort--from Ireland, from Wales, and from Brittany.

But even in what order they came no man can say for certain.

The young lady in my friend's story wished to hear the service of
the Church of England in 'the fine old Cornish language.' Alas! if Edward
VI.
and his advisers had been as wise, the religious history of Cornwall,
during two centuries at least, had been a happier one. It was liberal to
give Englishmen a Liturgy in their own tongue; but it was neither
liberal nor conspicuously intelligent to impose the same upon the Cornishmen,
who neither knew nor cared about the English language. It may be easy
to lay too much stress upon this grievance; since Cornishmen of this
period had a knack of being 'agin the government, anyway,' and had contrived
two considerable rebellions less than sixty years before, one because
they did not see their way to subscribing 2,500 pounds towards fighting
King James IV. of Scotland for protecting Perkin Warbeck, and the other
under Perkin's own leadership. But it was at least a serious grievance;
and the trouble began in the first year of Edward VI.'

s reign. The King began by issuing several Injunctions about religion;
and among them, this one:
That all images found in churches, for divine worship or otherwise,
should be pulled down and cast forth out of those churches; and that all
preachers should persuade the people from praying to saints, or for the
dead, and from the use of beads, ashes, processions, masses, dirges, and
praying to God publicly in an unknown tongue. A Mr. Body, one of the
commissioners appointed to carry out this Injunction, was pulling down
images in Helston church, near the Lizard, when a priest stabbed him with
a knife: "of which wound he instantly fell dead in that place. And though
the murderer was taken and sent up to London, tried, found guilty
of murder in Westminster Hall, and executed in Smithfield, yet the
Cornish people flocked together in a tumultuous and rebellious
manner, by the instigation of their priests in divers parts of the
shire or county, and committed many barbarities and outrages in the
same."

These disturbances ended in Arundel's rebellion, the purpose of which was
to demand the restoration of the old Liturgy; and, in truth, the Seven
Articles under which they formulated this demand must have seemed very
moderate indeed to their conservative minds. The rebellion failed,
of course, after a five weeks' siege of Exeter; and was bloodily revenged,
with something of the savage humour displayed by Jeffreys in punishing a
later Western rebellion. This part of the business was committed to Sir
Anthony (_alias_ William) Kingston, Knight, a Gloucestershire man, as
Provost Marshal; and "it is memorable what sport he made, by virtue
of his office, upon men in misery." Here are one or two of his merry
conceits, which read strangely like the jests reported by Herodotus:--

(1) "One Boyer, Mayor of Bodmin in Cornwall, had been amongst the rebels,
not willingly, but enforced: to him the Provost sent word he would
come and dine with him: for whom the Mayor made great provision. A little
before dinner, the Provost took the Mayor aside, and whispered him
in the ear, that an execution must that day be done in the town, and
therefore required to have a pair of gallows set up against dinner should
be done. The Mayor failed not of the charge.
Presently after dinner the Provost, taking the Mayor by the hand, intreated
him to lead him where the gallows was, which, when he beheld, he asked the
Mayor if he thought them to be strong enough.

'Yes' (said the Mayor),'doubtless they are.' 'Well, then'(said the Provost),
'get you up speedily, for they are provided for you.' 'I hope' (answered
the Mayor), 'you mean not as you speak.' 'In faith' (said the Provost),
'there is no remedy, for you have been a busie rebel.' And so without respite
or defence he was hanged to death; a most uncourteous part for a guest
to offer his host." --Sir Rich. Baker, 1641.

(2) "Near the same place dwelt a Miller, who had been a busie actor in
that rebellion; who, fearing the approach of the Marshal, told a sturdy
fellow, his servant, that he had occasion to go from home, and therefore
bid him, that if any man came to inquire after the miller, he should
not speak of him, but say that himself was the miller, and had been so for
three years before. So the Provost came and called for the miller, when
out comes the servant and saith he was the man.
The Provost demanded how long he had kept the mill? 'These three years'
(answered the servant). Then the Provost commanded his men to lay hold on
him and hang him on the next tree.

At this the fellow cried out that he was not the miller, but the miller's
man.
'Nay, sir' (said the Provost), 'I will take you at your word, and if thou
beest the miller, thou art a busie knave; if thou beest not, thou art a
false lying knave; and howsoever, thou canst never do thy master better
service than to hang for him'; and so, without more ado, he was
dispatched."--_Ibid_.

The story of one Mayow, whom Kingston hanged at a tavern signpost in the
town of St. Columb, has a human touch. "Tradition saith that his crime
was not capital; and therefore his wife was advised by her friends to
hasten to the town after the Marshal and his men, who had him
in custody, and beg his life.

Which accordingly she prepared to do; and to render herself the more
amiable petitioner before the Marshal's eyes, this dame spent so much
time in attiring herself and putting on her French hood, then in fashion,
that her husband was put to death before her arrival."
Such was the revenge wreaked on a population which the English of the day
took so little pains to understand that (as I am informed) in an
old geography book of the days of Elizabeth, Cornwall is described
as 'a foreign country on that side of England next to Spain.'

The first year of his reign he issued a Regulatory Code for the Reformed
Evangelical and Latin schools of Prussia, and in 1717 he issued the so-
called "Advisory Order," relating to the people's schools. In this latter
parents were urged, under penalty of "vigorous punishment," to send their
children to school to learn religion, reading, writing, to calculate, and
"all that could serve to promote their happiness and welfare." The tuition
fees of poor children he ordered paid out of the community poor-box (R.
273). The following year he directed the authorities of Lithuania to
relieve the existing ignorance there, and sent commissioners to provide
the villages with schoolmasters. From time to time he renewed his
directions. To insure a better class of teachers for the towns and rural
schools, he, in 1722, directed that no one be admitted to the office of
sacristan-schoolmaster [4] except tailors, weavers, smiths, wheelwrights,
and carpenters, and in 1738 he further restricted the position of teacher
in the town and rural schools to tailors.

Becoming especially interested in providing schools for the previously
neglected province of East Prussia, he gave the sum of fifty thousand
thalers as an endowment fund, the interest to be used in assisting
communities to build schoolhouses and maintain schools, and he also set
aside large tracts of land for school uses. Within a few years over a
thousand elementary schools had been established, and some eighteen
hundred new schools in Prussia owed their origin to the interest of this
King. He also took a similar interest in the establishment of schools in
Pomerania (R. 273), a part of which had but recently been wrested from
Sweden.

In 1737 the King issued his celebrated _Principia Regulative_, which
henceforth became the fundamental School Law for the province of East
Prussia. This prescribed conditions for the building of schoolhouses, the
support of the schoolmaster, tuition fees, and government aid. The
following digest of the section of the _Principia_ relating to these
matters gives a good idea as to the nature of the school regulations the
King sought to enforce:

    1. The parishes forming school societies were obliged to build school-
       houses and to keep them in repair.

    2. The State was to furnish the necessary timber and firewood.

    3. The expenses for doors, windows, and stoves to be obtained from
       collections.

    4. Every church to pay four thalers a year toward the support of the
       schoolmaster.

    5. Tuition fees for each child, from four to twelve years of age, to
       be four groschen per year.

    6. Government to pay the fee when a peasant sends more than one child
       to school.

    7. The peasants to furnish the teacher with certain provisions.

    8. The teacher to have the right of free pasture for his small stock
       and some fees from every child confirmed.

    9. Government to give the teacher one acre of land, which villagers
       were to till for him.

In 1738 the King further regulated the private schools and teachers in and
about Berlin, in particular dealing with their qualifications and fees.
The King showed, for the time, an interest in and solicitude for the
education of his people heretofore almost unknown. That his decrees were
in advance of the possibilities of the people in the matter of school
support is not to be wondered at. Still, they rendered useful service in
preparing the way for further organizing work by his successors, and in
particular in accustoming the people to the ideas of state oversight and
local school support. Under his successor and son, Frederick the Great,
the preparatory work of the father bore important fruit.

THE ORGANIZING WORK OF FREDERICK THE GREAT. In 1740 Frederick II, surnamed
the Great, succeeded his father, and in turn guided the destinies of
Prussia for forty-six years. His benevolently despotic rule has been
described on a preceding page (p. 474). Here we will consider only his
work for education. In 1740, 1741, and again in 1743 he issued
"regulations concerning the support of schools in the villages of
Prussia," in which he directed that new schools should be established,
teachers provided for them, and that "the existing school regulations and
the arrangements made in pursuance thereto should be permanent, and that
no change should be made under any pretext whatever."

In 1750 he effected a centralization of all the provincial church
consistories, except that of Catholic Silesia, under the Berlin
Consistory. This was a centralizing measure of large future importance, as
it centralized the administration of the schools, as well as that of the
churches, and transformed the Berlin Consistory into an important
administrative agent of the central government. To this new centralized
administrative organization the King issued instructions to pay special
attention to schools, in order that they might be furnished with able
schoolmasters and the young be well educated. One of the results of this
centralization was the gradual evolution of the modern German _Gymnasien_,
with uniform standards and improved instruction, out of the old and
weakened Latin schools of various types within the kingdom.

From 1756 to 1763 Frederick was engaged in a struggle for existence, known
as the Seven Years' War, but as soon as peace was at hand the King issued
new regulations "concerning the maintenance of schools," and began
employing competent schoolmasters for his royal estates. In April, 1763,
he issued instructions to have a series of general school regulations
prepared for all Prussia. These were drawn up by Julius Hecker, a former
pupil and teacher in Francke's Institution (p. 418) and now a pastor in
Berlin and counselor for the Berlin Consistory. After approval by the
King, these were issued, September 23, 1763, under the title of _General
Land-Schule Reglement_ (general school regulations for the rural and
village schools) of all Prussia (R. 274). These new regulations
constituted the first general School Code for the whole kingdom, and mark
the real foundation of the Prussian elementary-school system. Two years
later (1765) a similar but stronger set of regulations or Code was drawn
up and promulgated for the government of the Catholic elementary schools
in the province of Silesia (R. 275). This was a new province which
Frederick had wrested by force a few years previously (1748) from Maria
Theresa of Austria, and the addition of a large number of Catholics to
Prussia caused Frederick to issue specific regulations for schools among
them.

[Illustration: FIG. 169. THE KINGDOM OF PRUSSIA, 1740-86]

These two School Codes did not so much bring already existing schools into
a state system, but rather set up standards and obligations for an
elementary-school system in part to be created in the future. The schools
were still left under the supervision and direction of the Church, but the
State now undertook to tell the Church what it must do. To enforce the
obligation the State Inspectors of Prussia were directed to make an annual
inspection (R. 274, § 26) of all schools, and to forward a report on their
inspection to the Berlin Consistory, and for Catholic Silesia the
following significant injunction was placed in the Code:

    § 51. In order to render as permanent as possible this reform of
    schools, which lies near our heart, we cannot be satisfied with
    committing the care of the schools to the clergy alone. We find it
    necessary that our bureau of War and Domain, the bureau of the
    Episcopal Vicariate, and the dioceses in our Silesian and Glatz
    districts, as well as our special school inspectors, give all due
    attention to this subject, so important to the State.

THE PRUSSIAN SCHOOL CODES OF 1763 AND 1765. The regulations of 1763 were
issued, so the introduction reads (R. 274), because "the instruction of
youth" in the country had "come to be greatly neglected" and "the young
people were growing up in stupidity and ignorance." The King, therefore,
issued the new regulations "to the end that ignorance, so injurious and
unbecoming to Christianity, may be prevented and lessened, and the coming
time may train and educate in the schools more enlightened and virtuous
subjects."

To this end the King ordered compulsory education for the children of all
subjects from the ages of five to thirteen or fourteen, all apprentices to
be taught, and leaving certificates to be issued on completion of the
course (R. 274, §§ 1-4). The school hours were fixed, Sunday and summer
instruction regulated, tuition fees standardized, and the fees of the
children of the poor were ordered paid (R. 274, §§ 5-8). A school census,
and fines on parents not sending their children to school were provided
for (R. 274, §§ 10-11). The requirements for a teacher, his habits, his
qualifications and examination, the license to teach, and the extent to
which he might ply his trade or business, were all laid down in some
detail (R. 274 §§ 12-17). The organization, instruction, textbooks, order
of exercises, and discipline for all schools were prescribed at some
length (R. 274, §§ 19-21). The Code closed with a series of regulations
covering the relations of the schoolmaster and clergyman, and the
supervision of the instruction by the clergyman and clerical
superintendents (R. 274, §§ 25-26). Incapable teachers were ordered
suspended or deposed. A a final injunction relative to school attendance
the Code closed with the following sentence:

    In general we here confirm and renew all wholesome laws, published in
    former times, especially, that no clergyman shall admit to
    confirmation and the sacrament, any children not of his parish, nor
    those unable to read, or who are ignorant of the fundamental
    principles of evangelical religion.

The Code of 1765 for the Catholic schools of Silesia followed much the
same line as the Code of 1763, though in it the King placed special
emphasis on the training of schoolmasters, a subject in which he had
become much interested (R. 275 a); the regulation of the conditions under
which teachers lived and worked (R. 275 b); and the supervision of
instruction by the clergyman of the parish (R. 275 e). These directions
throw much light on the conditions surrounding teaching near the middle of
the eighteenth century. The nature of instruction in the Catholic schools,
and the compulsion to attend, were also definitely stated (R. 275 c-d).

These new Codes met with resistance everywhere. The money for the
execution of such a comprehensive project was not as yet generally
available; parents and churches objected to taxation and to the loss of
their children from work; the wealthy landlords objected to the financial
burden; the standards for teachers later on (1779) had to be lowered, and
veterans from Frederick's wars installed; and the examinations of teachers
had to be made easy [5] to secure teachers at all for the schools. While
there continued for some decades to be a vast difference between the
actual conditions in the schools and the requirements of these Codes, and
while the real establishment of a state school system awaited the first
decade of the nineteenth century for its accomplishment, much valuable
progress in organization nevertheless was made. In principle, at least,
Frederick the Great, by the Codes of 1763 and 1765, effected for
elementary education a transition from the church school of the Protestant
Reformation, and for Catholic Silesia from the parish school of the
Church, to the state school of the nineteenth century. It remained only
for his successors to realize in practice what he had made substantial
beginnings of in law. Nowhere else in Europe that early had such progress
in educational organization been made.

THE PRUSSIAN EXAMPLE FOLLOWED IN OTHER GERMAN STATES. The example of
Prussia was in time followed by the other larger German States. Würtemberg
issued a new School Code in 1792, which remained the ruling law for the
church schools throughout the eighteenth century. The Saxon King, Augustus
the Just, inspired by the example of Frederick, issued a mandate, in 1766,
reminding parents as to their duty to send children to school, and in 1773
issued a new Regulation, filled with "generous enthusiasm for the cause."
A teachers' training-school was founded at Dresden, in 1788, and four
others before the close of the century. In 1805 a comprehensive Code was
issued. This required that every child must be able to read, write, count,
and know the truths of religion to receive the sacrament; clergymen were
ordered to supervise the schools; school attendance was required from six
to fourteen; the pay of teachers and the government appropriations for
schools were increased; and a series of fines were imposed for violations
of the Code. Bavaria issued new school Codes in 1770 and 1778, and
additional schoolhouses were built and new textbooks written. After the
suppression of the Jesuits (1773) a new progressive spirit animated the
Catholic States, and Austria in particular, under the leadership of Maria
Theresa and Joseph II (p. 475), made marked progress in school
organization and educational reform.

In 1770 Maria Theresa appointed a School Commission to have charge of
education in Lower Austria; in 1771 established the first Austrian normal
school in Vienna; and in 1774 promulgated a General School Code (R. 276),
drawn up by the Abbot Felbiger, who had been most prominent in school
organization in Silesia. This Code provided for School Commissions in all
provinces [6] ordered the establishment of an elementary school in all
villages and parishes, a "principal" or higher elementary school in the
principal city of every canton, and a normal school in every province;
laid down the course of study for each; and gave details as to teachers,
instruction, compulsory attendance, support, and inspection similar to
Frederick's Silesian Code (R. 275). Continuation instruction up to twenty
years of age also was ordered. That such demands were much in advance of
what was possible is evident, and it is not surprising that, in the
reaction under Francis I, following the outburst of the French Revolution,
we find a decree (1805) that the elementary school shall be curtailed to
"absolutely necessary limits," and that the common people shall get in
elementary school only such ideas as will not trouble them in their work,
and which will not make them "discontented with their condition; their
intelligence shall be directed toward the fulfillment of their moral
duties, and prudent and diligent fulfillment of their domestic and
communal obligations."

THE BEGINNINGS OF TEACHER-TRAINING. The beginning of teacher-training in
German lands was the _Seminarium Praceptorum_ of Francke, established at
Halle (p. 419), in 1697. In 1738 Johann Julius Hecker (1707-68), one of
Francke's former students and teachers, and the author of the Prussian
Code of 1763, established the first regular seminary for teachers in
Prussia, to train intending theological students for the temporary or
parallel occupation of teaching in the Latin schools. In 1747 he
established a private _Lehrerseminar_ in Berlin, in connection with his
celebrated Realschule (p. 420), and there demonstrated the possibilities
of teacher-training. Frederick the Great was so pleased with the result
that, in 1753, he gave the school a subsidy and changed it into a royal
institution, and on every fitting occasion recommended school authorities
to it for teachers. Similar institutions were opened in Hanover, in 1751;
Wolfenbüttel, in 1753; in the county of Glatz in Silesia, in 1764 (R.
275); in Breslau, in 1765 and 1767; and in Carlsruhe, in 1768. In the
Silesian Code of 1765 Frederick specified (R. 275 a, § 2) six institutions
which he had designated as teacher-training schools.

These early Prussian institutions laid the foundations upon which the
normal-school system of the nineteenth century has been built. In Prussia
first, but soon thereafter in other German States (Austria, at Vienna,
1771; Saxe-Weimar, at Eisenach, in 1783; and Saxony, at Dresden, 1788) the
Teachers' Seminary was erected into an important institution of the State,
and the idea has since been copied by almost all modern nations. This
early development in Prussia was influential in both France and the United
States, as we shall point out further on.

Despite these many important educational efforts, though, the type and the
work of teachers remained low throughout the whole of the eighteenth
century. In the rural and village schools the teachers continued to be
deficient in number and lacking in preparation. Often the pastors had
first to give to invalids, cripples, shoemakers, tailors, watchmen, and
herdsmen the rudimentary knowledge they in turn imparted to the children.
In the towns of fair size the conditions were not much better than in the
villages. The elementary school of the middle-sized towns generally had
but one class, common for boys and girls, and the magistrates did little
to improve the condition of the schools or the teachers. In the larger
cities, and even in Berlin, the number of elementary schools was
insufficient, the schools were crowded, and many children had no
opportunity to attend schools. [7] In  Leipzig there was no public school
until 1792, in which year the city free school was established. Even
Sunday schools, supported by subscription, had been resorted to by Berlin,
after 1798, to provide journeymen and apprentices with some of the
rudiments of an education. The creation of a state school system out of
the insufficient and inefficient religious schools proved a task of large
dimensions, in Prussia as in other lands. Even as late as 1819 Dinter
found discouraging conditions (R. 279) among the teachers of East Prussia.

[Illustration: FIG. 170. A GERMAN LATE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY SCHOOL
(After a picture in the German School Museum in Berlin)]

FURTHER LATE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PROGRESS. Frederick the Great died in
1786. In the reign of his successors his work bore fruit in a complete
transfer of all schools from church to state control, and in the
organization of the strongest system of state schools the world had ever
known. The year following the death of Frederick the Great (1787), and
largely as an outgrowth of the preceding centralizing work with reference
to elementary education, the Superior School (_Oberschulcollegium_) Board
was established to exercise a similar centralized control over the older
secondary and higher schools of Prussia. Secondary and higher education
were now severed from church control, in principle at least, as elementary
education had been by the "Regulations" of 1763 and 1765. The year
following (1788) "Leaving Examinations" (_Maturitätsprüfung_) were
instituted to determine the completion of the gymnasial course. These, for
a time, were largely ineffective, due to clerical opposition, but the
centralizing work of this Superior School Board for the supervision of
higher education, and the state examinations for testing the instruction
of the secondary schools, were from the first important contributing
influences.

In 1794 came the culmination of all the preceding work in the publication
of the General Civil Code (_Allgemeine Landrecht_) for the State, in
which, in the section relating to schools, the following important
declaration was made:

    Schools and universities are state institutions, charged with the
    instruction of youth in useful information and scientific knowledge.
    Such institutions may be founded only with the knowledge and consent
    of the State. All public schools and educational institutions are
    under the supervision of the State, and are at all times subject to
    its examination and inspection.

The secular authority and the clergy were still to share jointly in the
control of the schools, but both according to rules laid down by the
State. In all cases of conflict or dispute, the secular authority was to
decide. This important document forms the _Magna Charta_ for secular
education in Prussia.

During the decade which followed the promulgation of this declaration of
state control but little additional progress of importance was
accomplished, though the Minister of Justice, to whom (1798) the
administration of Lutheran church and school affairs had been given,
maintained a correspondence for some years with the King regarding
"provisions for a better education and instruction of the children of
citizens and peasants," and stated to the King that "the object of reform
is national education, and its field of operation, therefore, all
provinces of the monarchy." The King, though, a weak, deeply religious,
and unimaginative man (Frederick William III, 1797-1840), who lacked the
energy and foresight of his predecessors, did little or nothing. Under
Frederick William III the State lacked vigor and drifted; the Church
regained something of its former power; and the army and the civil service
became corrupt. In 1806 a blow fell which brought matters to an immediate
crisis and forced important action.


II. A STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM AT LAST CREATED

THE HUMILIATION OF PRUSSIA. At the close of 1804 France, by vote, changed
from the Republic to an Empire, with Napoleon Bonaparte as first Emperor
of the French, and for some years he took pains that Frenchmen should
forget "Liberty and Equality" amid the surfeit of "Glory" he heaped upon
France. The great nations outside France, fearful of Napoleon's ambition
and power, did not take his accession to the throne of France so
complacently, and, in 1805, England, Sweden, Austria, and Russia formed
the "Third Coalition" against Napoleon in an effort to restore the balance
of power in Europe. Of the great powers of Europe only Prussia held aloof,
refused to take sides, and in consequence enjoyed a temporary prosperity
and freedom from invasion. For this, though, she was soon to pay a
terrible price. Having humiliated the Austrians and vanquished the
Russians, Napoleon now goaded the Prussians into attacking him, and then
utterly humiliated them in turn. At the battle of Jena (October 14, 1806)
the Prussian army was utterly routed, and forced back almost to the
Russian frontier. Officered by old generals and political favorites who
were no longer efficient, and backed by a state service honeycombed with
inefficiency and corruption, the Prussian army that had won such victories
under Frederick the Great was all but annihilated by the new and efficient
fighting machine created by the Corsican who now controlled the destinies
of France. By the Treaty of Tilsit (July 7, 1807) Prussia lost all her
lands west of the Elbe and nearly all her stealings from Poland--in all
about one half her territory and population--and was almost stricken from
the list of important powers in Europe. In all its history Prussia had
experienced no such humiliation as this. In a few months the constructive
work of a century had been undone.

THE REGENERATION OF PRUSSIA. The new national German feeling, which had
been slowly rising for half a century, now burst forth and soon worked a
regeneration of the State. In the school of adversity the King and the
people learned much, and the task of national reorganization was entrusted
to a series of able ministers whom the King and his capable Queen, Louise,
now called into service. His chief minister, Stein, created a free people
by abolishing serfdom and feudal land tenure (1807); eliminated feudal
distinctions in business; granted local government to the cities; and
broke the hold of the clergy on the educational system. His successor,
Hardenburg, extended the rights of citizenship, and laid the foundations
of government by legislative assemblies. Another minister, Scharnhorst,
reorganized the Prussian army (1807-13) by dismissing nearly all the old
generals, and introducing the principle of compulsory military service. In
all branches of the government service there were reorganizations, the one
thought of the leaders being to so reorganize and revitalize the State as
to enable it in time to overthrow the rule of Napoleon and regain its
national independence.

Though the abolition of serfdom, the reform of the civil service, and the
beginnings of local and representative government were important gains,
nothing was of secondary importance to the complete reorganization of
education which now took place. The education of the people was turned to
in earnest for the regeneration of the national spirit, and education was,
in a decade, made the great constructive agent of the State. Said the
King:

    Though we have lost many square miles of land, though the country
    has been robbed of its external power and splendor, yet we shall and
    will gain in intrinsic power and splendor, and therefore it is my
    earnest wish that the greatest attention be paid to public
    instruction.... The State must regain in mental force what it has lost
    in physical force.

His minister Stein said:

    We proceed from the fundamental principle, to elevate the moral,
    religious, and patriotic spirit in the nation, to instil into it again
    courage, self-reliance, and readiness to sacrifice everything for
    national honor and for independence from the foreigner.... To attain
    this end, we must mainly rely on the education and instruction of the
    young. If by a method founded on the true nature of man, every faculty
    of the mind can be developed, every noble principle of life be
    animated and nourished, all one-sided education avoided, and those
    tendencies on which the power and dignity of men rest, hitherto
    neglected with the greatest indifference, carefully fostered--then we
    may hope to see grow up a generation, physically and morally vigorous,
    and the beginnings of a better time.

FICHTE APPEALS TO THE LEADERS. Still more did the philosopher Fichte
(1762-1814), in a series of "Addresses to the German Nation," delivered in
Berlin during the winter [8] of 1807-08, appeal to the leaders to turn to
education to rescue the State from the miseries which had overwhelmed it.
Unable forcibly to resist, and with every phase of the government
determined by a foreign conqueror, only education had been overlooked, he
said, and to this the leaders should turn for national redemption (R.
277). He held that it rested with them to determine

    whether you will be the end and last of a race ... or the beginnings
    and germ of a new time, glorious beyond all your imaginings, and those
    from whom posterity will reckon the years of their welfare.... A
    nation that is capable, if it were only in its highest representation
    and leaders, of fixing its eyes firmly on the vision from the
    spiritual world, Independence, and being possessed with a love of it,
    will surely prevail over a nation that is only used as a tool of
    foreign aggressiveness and for the subjugation of independent nations.

With a fervor of emotion that was characteristic of a romantic age,
impelled by a conviction that the distinctive character of the German
people was indispensable to the world, and holding that what was necessary
also was possible, Fichte made the German leaders feel, with him, that

    to reshape reality by means of ideas is the business of man, his
    proper earthly task; and nothing can be impossible to a will confident
    of itself and of its aim. [9]

Philosopher, scholar, statesman]

Fichte's Addresses stirred the thinkers among the German people as they
had not been stirred since the days of the Reformation, [10] and a
national reorganization of education, with national ends in view, now took
place. As Duke Ernest remade Gotha, after the ravages of the Thirty Years'
War, by means of education (p. 317), so the leaders of Prussia now created
a new national spirit by taking over the school from the Church and
forging it into one of the greatest constructive instruments of the State.
The result showed itself in the "Uprising of Prussia," in the winter of
1812-13; the "War of Liberation," of 1813-15; the utter defeat of Napoleon
at the battle of Leipzig by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, in 1813; and
again at the battle of Waterloo by England and Prussia, [11] in 1815.
Still more clearly was the result shown in the humiliating defeat of
France, in 1870, when it was commonly remarked that the schoolmaster of
Prussia had at last triumphed. The regeneration of Prussia in the early
part of the nineteenth century, as well as its more recent humiliation,
stand as eloquent testimonials to the tremendous influence of education on
national destiny, when rightly and when wrongly directed.

THE REORGINATION OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. The first step in the process of
educational reorganization was the abolition (1807) of the
_Oberschulcollegium_ Board, established (p. 564) in 1787 to supervise
secondary and higher education, in order to get rid of clerical influence
and control. The next step was the creation instead (1808) of a Department
of Public Instruction, organized as a branch of the Interior Department of
the State.

One of the first steps of the acting head of the new department was to
send seventeen Prussian teachers (1808) to Switzerland to spend three
years, at the expense of the Government, in studying Pestalozzi's ideas
and methods, and they were particularly enjoined that they were not sent
primarily to get the mechanical side of the method, but to

    "warm yourselves at the sacred fire which burns in the heart of this
    man, so full of strength and love, whose work has remained so far
    below what he originally desired, below the essential ideas of his
    life, of which the method is only a feeble product.

    "You will have reached perfection when you have clearly seen that
    education is an art, and the most sublime and holy of all, and in what
    connection it is with the great art of the education of nations."

In 1809 Carl August Zeller (1774-1847), a pupil of Pestalozzi, who had
established two Pestalozzian training-colleges in Switzerland and had just
begun to hold Pestalozzian institutes in Würtemberg (p. 545), was called
to Prussia to organize a Teachers' Seminary (normal school) to train
teachers in the Pestalozzian methods. The seventeen Prussian teachers, on
their return from study with Pestalozzi, were also made directors of
training institutions, or provincial superintendents of instruction. In
this way Pestalozzian ideas were soon in use in the elementary school
rooms of Prussia, and so effective was this work, and so readily did the
Prussian teachers catch the spirit of Pestalozzi's endeavors, that at the
Berlin celebration of the centennial of his birth, in 1846, the German
educator Diesterweg [12] said:

    By these men and these means, men trained in the Institution at
    Yverdon under Pestalozzi, the study of his publications, and the
    applications of his methods in the model and normal schools of
    Prussia, after 1808, was the present Prussian, or rather Prussian-
    Pestalozzian school system established, for he is entitled to at least
    one half the fame of the German popular schools.

[Illustration: FIG. 171. DINTER (1760-1831)
Director of Teachers' Seminaries in Saxony; Superintendent of Education in
East Prussia.]

Similarly Gustavus Friedrich Dinter, who early distinguished himself as
principal of a Teachers' Seminary in Saxony, was called to Prussia and
made School Counselor (Superintendent) for the province of East Prussia.
Wherever Prussia could find men, in other States, who knew Pestalozzian
methods and possessed the new conception of education, they were called to
Prussia and put to work, and the statement of Dinter was characteristic of
the spirit which animated their work. He said: [13]

    I promised God, that I would look upon every Prussian peasant child as
    a being who could complain of me before God, if I did not provide him
    with the best education, as a man and a Christian, which it was
    possible for me to provide.

WORK OF THE TEACHERS SEMINARIES. Napoleon had imposed heavy financial
indemnities on Prussia, as well as loss of territory, and the material
means with which to establish schools were scanty indeed. With a keen
conception of the practical difficulties, the leaders saw that the key to
the problem lay in the creation of a new type of teaching force, and to
this end they began from the first to establish Teachers' Seminaries.
Those who desired to enter these institutions were carefully selected, and
out of them a steady stream of what Horace Mann described (R. 278) as a
"beneficent order of men" were sent to the schools, "moulding the
character of the people, and carrying them forward in a career of
civilization more rapidly than any other people in the world are now
advancing." Mann described, with marked approval, both the teacher and the
training he received.

So successful were these institutions that within a decade, under the glow
of the new national spirit animating the people, the elementary schools
were largely transformed in spirit and purpose, and the position of the
elementary-school teacher was elevated from the rank of a trade (R. 279)
to that of a profession (R. 278). By 1840, when the earlier fervor had
died out and a reaction had clearly set in, there were in Prussia alone
thirty-eight Teachers' Seminaries for elementary teachers, approximately
thirty thousand elementary schools, and every sixth person in Prussia was
in school. In the other German States, and in Holland, Sweden, and France,
analogous but less extensive progress in providing normal schools and
elementary schools had been made; but in Austria, which did not for long
follow the Prussian example, the schools remained largely stationary for
more than half a century to come.

NATIONALIZING THE ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION. That the system of elementary
vernacular or people's schools (the term _Volksschule_ now began to be
applied) now created should be permeated by a strong nationalistic tone
was, the times and circumstances considered, only natural. Though the
Pestalozzian theories as to the development of the mental faculties,
training through the senses, and the power of education to regenerate
society were accepted, along with the new Pestalozzian subject-matter and
methods in instruction (p. 543,) all that could be rendered useful to the
Prussian State in its extremity naturally was given special emphasis. Thus
all that related to the home country--geography, history, and the German
speech--was taught as much from the patriotic as from the pedagogical
point of view. Music was given special emphasis as preparatory for
participation in the patriotic singing-societies and festivals, which were
organized at the time of the "Uprising of Prussia" (1813). Drawing and
arithmetic were emphasized for their practical values. Physical exercises
were given an emphasis before unknown, because of their hygienic and
military values. Finally religion was given an importance beyond that of
Pestalozzi's school, but with the emphasis now placed on moral
earnestness, humility, self-sacrifice, and obedience to authority, rather
than the earlier stress on the Catechism and church doctrine.

Clearly perceiving, decades ahead of other nations, the power of such
training to nationalize a people and thus strengthen the State, the
Prussian leaders, in the first two decades of the nineteenth century, laid
the foundations of that training of the masses, and of teachers for the
masses (R. 280), which, more than any other single item, paved the way for
the development of a national German spirit, the unification of German
lands into an Imperial German Empire, and that blind trust in and
obedience to authority which has recently led to a second national
humiliation.

THE REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. Alongside this elementary-
school system for the masses of the people, the older secondary and higher
school system for a directing class (p. 553) also was largely reorganized
and redirected. The first step in this direction was the appointment, in
1809, of Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835), "a philosopher, scholar,
philologist, and statesman" of the first rank, to the headship of the new
Prussian Department of Public Instruction. During the two and a half years
he remained in charge important work in the reorganization of secondary
and higher education was accomplished. In 1817 the Department of Public
Instruction was changed from a bureau to an independent Ministry for
Spiritual and Instructional Affairs. By 1825, when governing school boards
were ordered established in each province, and made responsible to the
Ministry for Education at Berlin, the organization of the state school
system was virtually complete. For the next half-century the changes made
were in the nature of the perfection of bureaucratic organization, rather
than any fundamental organizing change. During the early years
improvements of great future importance for secondary education were
effected in the creation of a well-educated, professional teaching body,
and in the standardization of courses and of work.

In 1810 the examination of all secondary-school teachers, according to a
uniform state plan, was ordered. The examinations were to be conducted for
the State by the university authorities; to be based on university
training in the gymnasial subjects, with an opportunity to reveal special
preparation in any subject or subjects; and no one in the future could
even be nominated for a position as a gymnasial teacher who had not passed
this examination. This meant the erection of the work of teaching in the
secondary schools into a distinct profession; the elimination from the
schools of the theological student who taught for a time as a stepping-
stone to a church living; and the end of easy local examination and
approval by town authorities or the patrons of a school. To insure still
better preparation of candidates, Pedagogical Seminars were begun in the
universities [14] for imparting to future gymnasial teachers some
pedagogical knowledge and insight, while Philological Seminars also
appeared, about the same time, [15] to give additional training in
understanding the spirit of instruction in the chief subjects of the
gymnasial course--the classics. In 1826 a year of trial teaching before
appointment (_Probejahr_) was added for all candidates, and in 1831 new
and more stringent regulations for the examination of teachers were
ordered. [16] At least two generations ahead of other nations, Prussia
thus developed a body of professional teachers for its secondary schools.

UNIFICATION OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. In 1812 the Leaving Examinations
(_Maturitätsprüfung_), instituted in 1788, but ineffective through
clerical opposition, were revived and strictly enforced. In 1834 the
passing of such an examination was made necessary to entering nearly all
branches of the state civil service, thus securing an educated body of
minor public officials. This same year the universities gave up their
entrance examinations, and have since depended entirely on the Leaving
Examinations of the State.

The immediate effect of the reinstitution of the Leaving Examinations was
to unify the work of all the different surviving types of classical
secondary schools--_Gymnasium, Lyceum, Pädagogium, Collegium, Lateinische
Schule, Akademie_--all standard nine-year schools henceforth taking the
name of _Gymnasien_. Those institutions which could not meet the standards
of a nine-year classical school were either permitted to do the first six
years of the work, being known as _Pro-Gymnasien_, or the modern languages
were substituted for the ancient, and they became middle-class
institutions under the name of _Bürgerschulen_. A few _Realschulen_ also
were in existence, and these were permitted to continue, as middle-class
institutions, but without any state recognition. Thus, without the
destruction of institutions, the accumulated foundations of the centuries
were transformed into a series of organized state schools to serve the
needs of the State.

The next step was the promulgation of a uniform course of instruction for
all _Gymnasien_ and _Pro-Gymnasien_. This was done in 1816. The studies
were Latin, Greek, German, mathematics, history, geography, religion, and
science, the amount of time to be devoted to each ranging, in the order
listed, from a maximum for Latin to a minimum for science. Up to 1824
Greek was not absolutely required; from 1824 to 1837 it was required,
unless the substitution of a modern language was permitted; but after
1837, when the type of German secondary school had become fairly well
fixed, and the devotion to humanistic studies had reached a climax, Greek
became a fixed and unvarying requirement. [17]

FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN. One result of the Treaty of Tilsit
(p. 566) was that Prussia had lost all her universities, except three
along the Baltic coast. Both Halle and Göttingen were lost, and the loss
of Halle was a severe blow. In 1807 Fichte, who had been a professor at
Jena, drew up a plan and submitted it to the King for the organization of
a new university at Berlin. When Humboldt came to the head of the
Department of Public Instruction the idea at once won his enthusiastic
approval. In May, 1809, he reported favorably on the project to the King,
and three months later a Cabinet Order was issued creating the new
university, giving it an annual money grant, and assigning a royal palace
to it for a home. The spirit with which the new institution was founded
may be inferred from the following extract from a memorial, published by
Humboldt, in 1810. In this he said:

The State should not treat the universities as if they were higher
classical schools or schools of special sciences. On the whole the State
should not look to them at all for anything that directly concerns its own
interests, but should rather cherish a conviction that, in fulfilling
their real destination, they will not only serve its own purposes, but
serve them on an infinitely higher plane, commanding a much wider field of
operation, and affording room to set in motion much more efficient springs
and forces than are at the disposal of the State itself.

This university was indeed a new creation, and of far more significance
for the future of university work than even the founding of Halle had
been. To the selection of its first faculty Humboldt devoted almost all
his energies during the period he remained in office. From the first, high
attainment in some branch of knowledge, and the ability to advance that
knowledge, was placed ahead of mere teaching skill. The most eminent
scholars in all lines were invited to the new "chairs," and when it opened
(1810) its first faculty represented the highest attainment of scholarship
in German lands. From the first the instruction divested itself of almost
all that characterized the school. The lecture replaced the classroom
recitation, and the seminar, in which small groups of advanced students
investigate a problem under the direction of a professor, was given a
place of large importance in the institution. Original research and
contributions to knowledge marked the work of both students and
professors, the object being, not to train teachers for the schools, but
to produce scholars capable of advancing knowledge by personal research.
Even more than at Halle, the institution was a place where professors and
students worked to discover truth, uninfluenced by any preconceived
notions and unmindful of what older ideas might be upset in the process.
The value of such pioneer work for university scholars everywhere is not
likely to be overestimated.

SPECIALIZATION IN UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTION EMPHASIZED. Specialization in
some field of knowledge soon came to be the ruling idea, and this proved
exceedingly fruitful in the years which followed. There Bopp developed the
study of comparative grammar on the basis of the Sanskrit. There Dietz
founded Romance philology. Ritschl turned his students to the study of
Latin inscriptions to reconstruct the past. Lepsius began the study of
Egyptology with a spade. Niebuhr's _Roman History_ (1811) was the
institution's first fruit, and his successor, Ranke, showed his students
how to study history from the sources. Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Lotze made
over philosophy. Fechner and Wundt began there the study of experimental
psychology. Stahl and von Savigny created new standards in the study of
law. Müller introduced the microscope into the study of pathological
anatomy. Schultze systematized zoölogy. Liebig, who had opened at Giessen
(1824) what was probably the first chemical laboratory in the world open
to students, was drawn to Berlin and created there a new chemistry. Still
later, Helmholtz created there a new physics.

The effect of all this on the expansion of the work of the philosophical
faculty was marked. The new philological and historical sciences, the
biological sciences, and the mathematical sciences, were all greatly
expanded in scope, and the new philosophical faculty, evolved out of the
old arts faculty (p. 554), now attained to the place of first importance
in the university--a position it has ever since retained. Law and medicine
were also given a new direction and emphasis, and even the teaching of
theology was greatly improved under the specialization in instruction and
the freedom in teaching which now became the rule.

The effect on the other German universities was marked. Some of the older
institutions (Erfurt, Wittenberg, Cologne, Mainz) died out, while new
foundations (Breslau, 1811; Bonn, 1818; Munich, 1826) after the new model,
took their place. Those that continued were changed in character, [18] and
a new unity was established throughout the German university world. By
1850 exact scientific research, in both libraries and laboratories, and a
sober search for truth, had become the watchword of all the German
universities. In consequence they naturally assumed a world leadership,
and were frequented by students from many lands. Especially has the United
States been influenced in its university development by the large number
of university teachers who received their specialized training in the
German universities [19] during the latter half of the nineteenth century.
The lecture, the seminar, laboratory investigation, research, the
doctorate, and academic freedom in study and teaching are distinctive
contributions to our university development drawn from German lands, and
superimposed on our earlier English-type college. The founding of Johns
Hopkins University, at Baltimore, in 1876, on the German model, marked the
erection of the first distinctively research university in America.

A TWO-CLASS STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM CREATED. We thus see that Prussia by 1815,
clearly by 1825, had taken over education from the Church and made of it
an instrument of the State to serve State ends. For the masses there was
the _Volksschule_, superseding the old religious vernacular school and
clearly designed to create an intelligent but obedient and patriotic
citizenship for the Fatherland, and in this school the great majority of
the children of the State received their education for citizenship and for
life. This was for both sexes, and was entirely a German school.
Attendance upon this school was made compulsory, and beyond this some
continuation education early began to be provided (Rs. 274, Section 6; 275
d; 276, Section 15). Within the past half-century continuation education,
especially along vocational lines, as we shall point out in a subsequent
chapter, has received in German lands a very remarkable development. To
insure that this school should serve the State in the way desired,
Teachers' Seminaries, for the training of _Volksschule_, teachers, were
from the first made a feature of the new state system.

[Illustration: FIG. 173. THE PRUSSIAN STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM CREATED
Compare with Fig. 269 and note the difference between a European two-class
system and the American democratic educational ladder.]

For those who were to form the official and directing class of Society--a
closely limited, almost entirely male, intellectual aristocracy--education
in separate classical schools, with university or professional training
superimposed, was provided, and this type of training offered a very
thorough preparation for a small and a carefully selected class. Out of
this class the leaders of Germany for a century have been drawn. [20] For
this classical school also the universities were early directed to prepare
a well-educated body of teachers. The Prussian plan was followed in all
its essentials in the other German States, so that the drawing given (Fig.
173) was true for Germany as a whole, as well as for Prussia, up at least
to 1914.

NEW NINETEENTH-CENTURY TENDENCIES MANIFESTED. In this early evolution of
the Prussian state school systems we find two prominent nineteenth-century
ideas expressing themselves. The first is the new conception of the State
as not merely a government organized to secure national safety and
protection from invasion, but rather an organization of the people to
promote public welfare and realize a moral and political ideal. To this
end state control of the whole range of education, to enable the State to
promote intellectual and moral and social progress along lines useful to
the State, became a necessity, and some form of this education, in the
interests of the public welfare, must now be extended to all. Though
France and the new American nation gave earlier political expression to
this new conception of the State, it was in Prussia that the idea attained
its earliest concrete and for long its most complete realization. Seeing
further and more clearly than other nations the possibilities of
education, the practical workers of Prussia, and after them the other
German States, took over education as a function of the State for the
propagation of the national ideas and the promotion of the national
culture. Of this development Paulsen says:

    In the nineteenth century Germany took the lead in the educational
    movement among the nations of Europe. The German universities have
    become acknowledged centers of scientific research for the whole
    world.... In the domain of primary and technical education Germany has
    also become the universal teacher of Europe.

    But it must not be forgotten, in this connection, that the German
    people had been the pupils of their neighbors during a greater length
    of time and with greater assiduity than any other European nation.
    Thus, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Germany imported the
    culture of Humanism from Italy. During the seventeenth and eighteenth
    centuries she introduced the modern courtly culture and language of
    the French people, besides giving admission, since the middle of the
    eighteenth century, to the philosophy, science, and literature of
    English middle-class society. Lastly, since the end of the eighteenth
    century, the Germans have yielded themselves to the influence of the
    Hellenic spirit with greater fervor than any other nation.

The second nineteenth-century idea which early found expression in the
Prussian State, and one which became a dominant factor during the latter
half of the century, was the idea of utilizing the schools, as state
institutions, to promote national ends--to unify and nationalize peoples.
National self-consciousness here first found concrete expression, and with
wonderful practical results. From a geographical expression, consisting of
nearly four hundred petty self-governing cities, principalities, and
states, and some fourteen hundred independent noblemen and prelates,
before the Napoleonic wars, their close found the German people free from
serfdom, united in spirit, and organized politically into thirty-eight
modern-type States. In 1870, largely as a result of the nationalizing
efforts of government and education, working hand in hand, an Imperial
Empire of twenty-two States and three Free Cities was formed. The struggle
for national realization, begun by Prussia after 1807, and with education
as the important constructive tool of the State, has since been copied by
nation after nation and has become the dominant force of modern history.
To awaken a national self-consciousness, to acquire national unity, and to
infuse into all a common culture has supplanted the humanistic
cosmopolitanism of the eighteenth century and become the dominant
characteristic of nineteenth-century political history. In this Prussia
led the way.

THE PERIOD OF REACTION. Through the period preceding the Wars of
Liberation (1813-15), and afterward for a few years, an educational zeal
animated the Government. The schools during this period were free on the
one hand from politics and on the other from minute official regulation.
As one writer well stated: [21]

    It was difficult to decide whether the schools derived their
    importance from the life which surged around them, or whether their
    importance was due to their intrinsic power, very carefully fostered
    by the state authorities.... There was spirit and life in Prussia;
    there was much activity and liberty in contriving, with little outward
    parade. Any foreigner, visiting Prussia, might observe that the
    vitalizing breath of government, like the spirit of God, was acting
    upon the whole people.

Napoleon was finally vanquished at Waterloo (1815) and sent to Saint
Helena, and the Congress of Vienna (1815) remade the map of Europe. In
doing so it forgot that the people wanted constitutional government,
instead of a return to absolute rulers. It restored old thrones, rights,
and territories, and inaugurated a policy of political reaction which
increased in intensity with time and dominated the governments of
continental Europe until after the middle of the century. Under the lead
of the Austrian minister, Metternich, and by "third-degree" methods, the
so-called Holy Alliance [22] of continental Europe suppressed free speech,
democratic movements, political liberties, university freedom, and
liberalism in government and religion. The governments in this Alliance
redirected and restricted the people's schools, as much as could be done,
to make them conform in purpose to their reactionary ideas. In
consequence, the development of popular education in Germany, as well as
in France and other continental lands, was for a time checked. The great
start obtained by Prussia and the German States before 1820, though, was
such that what had been done there could not be wholly undone. In France,
Spain, the Italian Kingdoms, the Austrian States, and Russia, on the other
hand, what had not been developed to any extent could be prevented from
developing, and in these lands popular education was given back to the
Church to control and direct. In England, also, though for other reasons
there, the Church retained its control over elementary education for half
a century longer.

CHANGE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE SCHOOLS. The King of Prussia, Frederick
William III (1797-1840), though he had given full adherence to the
movement for general education during the dark period of Prussian history,
was after all never fully in sympathy with the liberal aspect of the
movement. After Austria, by the settlement at Vienna, became the leader of
the German States, and Metternich the dominating political personality of
Europe, the King came more and more to favor a restriction of liberties
and the holding of education to certain rather limited lines, fearful that
too much education of the people might prove harmful to the Government.
Accordingly, under the influence of the King and against the desires of
the liberal leaders, Prussia now changed direction and embarked on a
policy of reaction which checked normal educational progress; led to the
unsuccessful revolution of 1848 and the subsequent almost fanatical
governmental opposition to reforms; and was in large part responsible for
the disaster of 1918. It is an interesting speculation as to how different
the future German and world history might have been had Prussia and the
German States held to the liberal ideas of the earlier period, and drawn
their political conceptions from England and the new American nation,
rather than from Austria and Russia.

Accordingly, in November, 1817, the Department of Public Instruction was
replaced by a Ministry for Spiritual, Educational, and Medical Affairs,
and Karl, Baron von Altenstein, was made Minister. He continued in office
until his death, [23] in 1840, and his administration was marked by an
increasing state centralization and limitation of the earlier plans. In
1819 he codified all previous practices into a general school law for the
kingdom. While the King never really approved and issued it, it
nevertheless became a basis for future work and is the law so
enthusiastically described by Cousin, in 1830 (R. 280). Under his
administration the earlier creative enthusiasm and the energy for the
execution of great ideas disappeared, and the earlier "stimulating and
encouraging attitude on the part of the authorities was now replaced by
the timid policy of the drag and the brake." The earlier preparatory work
in the development of Teachers' Seminaries and the establishment of
elementary schools was allowed to continue; Pestalozzian ideas were for a
time not seriously restricted; compulsory attendance was more definitely
ordered enforced, in 1825; the abolition of tuition fees for _Volksschule_
education was begun in 1833, but not completed until 1888; and a more
careful supervision of schools was instituted, in 1834. The great change
was rather in the spirit and direction of the instruction. The early
tendency to emphasize nationalism and religious instruction (p. 571) was
now stressed, and the liberal aspects of Pestalozzianism were increasingly
subordinated to the more formal instruction and to nationalistic ends. The
soldier and the priest joined hands in diverting the schools to the
creation of intelligent, devout, patriotic, and, above all else, obedient
Germans, while the universal military idea, brought in by the successful
work of Scharnhorst (p. 567), and retained after the War of Liberation as
a survival of the old dynastic and predatory conception of the State, was
more and more emphasized in the work of the schools and the life of the
citizen. When Horace Mann reported on his visit to the schools of the
German States, in 1843, he called attention to this element of weakness
(R. 281), as well as to their many elements of strength.

FURTHER INTOLERANCE AND REACTION. The reactionary tendencies which set in
after the settlement of Vienna had, by 1840, produced stagnation in the
life of the Governments of Europe, and the revolutions of 1848, which
broke out in France, Italy, Switzerland, and the different German and
Austrian States, were revolts against the reactionary governmental rule
and an expression of disappointment at the failure to secure
constitutional government. The revolutions were both successful and
unsuccessful--successful in that the greater liberty they sought came
later on, but unsuccessful at the time. In consequence, immediately
following 1848, an even more reactionary educational policy was
instituted. A sonnet could not well be more summary.
In fact, the poem in structure of thought very closely resembles a sonnet;
its first two stanzas corresponding to the octave, and its last
stanza to the sestett.

This will perhaps be thought very trivial criticism of a poem which most
people admit to be, as a piece of writing, all but absolutely flawless.

But allowing that it expresses perfectly what it sets out to express, I yet
doubt if it deserve the place assigned to it by Mr. Bridges.
Expression counts for a great deal: but ideas perhaps count for more.
And in the value of the ideas expressed I cannot see that 'Autumn'
comes near to rivalling the 'Nightingale' (for instance) or
'Melancholy.'

The thought that Autumn has its songs as well as Spring has neither the
rarity nor the subtlety nor the moral value of the thought that:

"In the very temple of Delight Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue Can burst joy's grape
against his palate fine; His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,
And be among her cloudy trophies hung."
To test it in another way:--It is perfect, no doubt: but it has not the one
thing that now and then in poetry rises (if I may use the paradox) above
perfection. It does not contain, as one or two of the Odes contain, what I
may call the Great Thrill. It nowhere compels that sudden 'silent,
upon a peak in Darien' shiver, that awed surmise of the magic of
poetry which arrests one at the seventh stanza of the 'Nightingale'
or before the closing lines of 'Psyche.'

    Such verse as:
    
    "Perhaps the self-same song hath found a path Through the sad heart of
    Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn; The
    same that oft-times hath Charm'd magic casements, opening on
    the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn--"
    Reaches beyond technical perfection to the very root of all tears
    and joy.
    Such verse links poetry to Love itself--
    "Half angel and half bird, And all a wonder and a wild desire."
    The 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' does not perhaps quite reach this divine
thrill: but its second and third stanzas have a rapture that comes
very near to it (I will speak anon of the fourth stanza): and I
should not quarrel with one who preferred these two stanzas even
to the close of 'Psyche.'

Now it seems to me that the mere touching of this poetic height--the
mere feat of causing this most exquisite vibration in the human nerves--gives
a poem a quality and a rank apart; a quality and a rank not secured to
'Autumn' by all its excellence of expression. I grant, of course, that
it takes two to produce this thrill--the reader as well as the poet.

    And if any man object to me that he, for
    his part, feels a thrill as poignant when
    he reads
    stanza 2 of 'Autumn' as when he reads stanza 7 of the 'Nightingale,'
then I confess that I shall have some difficulty in answering him.

    But I believe very few, if any, will assert this of themselves.

                And perhaps we may get at the truth of men's
    feelings on this point in another way. Suppose that of
                      these four poems,
    'Autumn,' 'Nightingale,' 'Psyche,' and 'Grecian Urn,'
    one were doomed to perish, and fate allowed us to choose
    which one should be abandoned. Sorrowful as the choice
    must be, I believe that lovers of poetry would find
    themselves least loth to part with 'Autumn'; that the
    loss of either of the others would be foreseen as a
    sharper wrench.
    
    For the others lie close to human emotion; are indeed
                      interpenetrated with emotion; whereas
    'Autumn' makes but an objective appeal, chiefly to the visual sense.

It is, as I have said, a decorative picture; and even so it hardly beats
the pictures in stanza 4 of the 'Grecian Urn'--
"What little town by river or sea-shore, Or mountain, built with peaceful
citadel, Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?"

Though Keats, to be sure, comes perilously near to spoiling these
lines by the three answering ones--
"And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not
a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return."

--Which, though beautiful in themselves, involve a confusion of thought;
since (in Mr. Colvin's words) "they speak of the arrest of life as though
it were an infliction in the sphere of reality, and not merely a necessary
condition in the sphere of art, having in that sphere its own compensations."

But it is time to be drawing up one's own order for the Odes. The first
place, then, let us give to the 'Nightingale,' for the intensity of its
emotion, for the sustained splendour and variety of its language, for the
consummate skill with which it keeps the music matched with the mood, and
finally because it attains, at least twice, to the 'great thrill.'

Nor can one preferring it offend Mr. Bridges, who confesses that he
"could not name any English poem of the same length which contains so much
beauty as this ode."
For the second place, one feels inclined at first to bracket 'Psyche' with
the 'Grecian Urn.' Each develops a beautiful idea. In 'Psyche' the poet
addresses the loveliest but latest-born vision 'of all Olympus's faded
hierarchy,' and promises her that, though born:

"Too late for antique vows, Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,"

She shall yet have a priest, the poet, and a temple built in some untrodden
region of his mind--
"And in the midst of this wide quietness A rosy sanctuary will I
dress With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain, With buds, and
bells, and stars without a name, With all the gardener Fancy e'er
could feign, Who breeding flowers will never breed the same:
And there shall be for thee all soft delight That shadowy thought
can win, A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, To let the
warm Love in!"

The thought of the 'Grecian Urn' is (to quote Mr. Bridges) "the supremacy
of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of
perfection." And this also is true and beautiful. Idea for idea, there
is little to choose between the two odes. Each has the 'great thrill,'
or something very like it. The diction of 'Psyche' is more splendid;
the mood of the 'Grecian Urn' happier and (I think) rarer. But 'Psyche'
asserts its superiority in the orderly development of its idea, which rises
steadily to its climax in the magnificent lines quoted above, and on that
note triumphantly closes: whereas the 'Grecian Urn' marches uncertainly,
recurs to its main idea without advancing it, reaches something like
its climax in the middle stanza, and tripping over a pun (as Mr.
Bridges does not hesitate to call 'O Attic shape! fair attitude!') at
the entrance of the last stanza, barely recovers itself in time to make
a forcible close.

(1) 'Nightingale,' (2) 'Psyche,' (3) 'Grecian Urn.' Shall the next place
go to 'Melancholy?' The idea of this ode (I contrasted it just now with the
idea of 'Autumn') is particularly fine; and when we supply the first stanza
which Keats discarded we see it to be well developed.
The discarded stanza lies open to the charge of staginess. One may answer
that Keats meant it to be stagey: that he deliberately surrounded the
quest of the false Melancholy with those paste-board 'properties'--the
bark of dead men's bones, the rudder of a dragon's tail 'long
severed, yet still hard with agony', the cordage woven of large
uprootings from the skull of bald Medusa'--in order to make the
genuine Melancholy more effective by contrast.[1] Yet, as Mr.

Bridges points out, the ode does not hit so hard as one would expect:
and it has seemed to me that the composition of Durer's great drawing
may have something to do with this.
Durer _did_ surround his Melancholia with 'properties,' and he _did_ evoke
a figure which all must admit to be not only tremendously impressive but
entirely genuine, whatever Keats may say; a figure so haunting, too, that
it obtrudes its face between us and Keats's page and scares away his
delicate figure of:

"Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu . . ."--
Reducing him to the pettiness of a Chelsea-china shepherd.

    Mr. Bridges, too, calls attention to a false note in the second
    stanza:--
    "Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows, Emprison her soft hand, and
    let her rave, And feed, feed deep upon her peerless eyes."
    So prone was Keats to sound this particular false note that Mr.
    Bridges had to devote some three pages of his essay to an examination
    of the poet's want of taste in his speech about women and his lack
    of true insight into human passion. The worst trick this disability
    ever played upon Keats was to blind him to his magnificent opportunity
    in 'Lamia'--an opportunity of which the missing is felt as
    positively cruel: but it betrayed him also into occasional lapses
    and ineptitudes which almost rival Leigh Hunt's--
    "The two divinest things the world has got-- A lovely woman in a
rural spot."

    This blemish may, perhaps, condemn it to a place below 'Autumn'; of which
    (I hope) reason has been shown why it cannot rank higher than (4).
    And (6) _longo intervallo_ comes 'Indolence,' which may be fearlessly
    called an altogether inferior performance.
    
    The 'May Ode' stands by itself, an exquisite fragment. But the
    two odes from _Endymion_ may be set well above 'Indolence,' and
that to 'Sorrow,' in my opinion, above 'Autumn,' and only a little
way behind the leaders.

But the fall of the year is marked for us by a ceremony more poignant, more
sorrowfully seasonable than any hymned by Hood or by Keats. Let us celebrate--

LAYING UP THE BOAT.

There arrives a day towards the end of October--or with luck we may tide
over into November--when the wind in the mainsail suddenly takes
a winter force, and we begin to talk of laying up the boat.

Hitherto we have kept a silent compact and ignored all change in the season.
We have watched the blue afternoons shortening, fading through
lilac into grey, and let pass their scarcely perceptible warnings.

One afternoon a few kittiwakes appeared. A week later the swallows fell
to stringing themselves like beads along the coastguard's
telephone-wire on the hill.

They vanished, and we pretended not to miss them. When our hands grew chill
with steering we rubbed them by stealth or stuck them nonchalantly
in our pockets.

But this vicious unmistakable winter gust breaks the spell.
We take one look around the harbour, at the desolate buoys awash and
tossing; we cast another seaward at the thick weather through
which, in a week at latest, will come looming the earliest of the
Baltic merchantmen, our November visitors--bluff vessels with
red-painted channels, green deckhouses, white top-strakes, wooden
davits overhanging astern, and the Danish flag fluttering aloft in
the haze.

Then we find speech; and with us, as with the swallows, the move into winter
quarters is not long delayed when once it comes into discussion.

We have dissembled too long; and know, as we go through the form of debating
it, that our date must be the next spring-tides.

This ritual of laying up the boat is our way of bidding farewell to summer;
and we go through it, when the day comes, in ceremonial silence.
_Favete linguis!

_ The hour helps us, for the spring-tides at this season reach their height
a little after night-fall, and it is on an already slackening flood
that we cast off our moorings and head up the river with our
backs to the waning sunset.

Since we tow a dinghy astern and are ourselves towed by the silent
yachtsman, you may call it a procession.
She has been stripped, during the last two days, of sails, rigging,
and all spars but the mainmast.

Now we bring her alongside the town quay and beneath the shears--the
abhorred shears--which lift this too out of its step, dislocated
with a creak as poignant as the cry of Polydorus.

We lower it, lay it along the deck, and resume our way; past quay doors
and windows where already the townsfolk are beginning to light
their lamps; and so by the jetties where foreign crews rest with
elbows on bulwarks and stare down upon us idly through the dusk.

She is after all but a little cutter of six tons, and we might well apologise,
like the Athenian, for so diminutive a corpse.

But she is our own; and they never saw her with jackyarder spread, or spinnaker
or jib-topsail delicate as samite--those heavenly wings!

--nor felt her gallant spirit straining to beat her own record
before a tense northerly breeze.

Yet even to them her form, in pure white with gilt fillet, might
tell of no common obsequies.

  
  For in every good ship the miracle of
  Galatea is renewed; and the shipwright who sent
  this keel down the ways to her element
  surely beheld the birth of a goddess. He still
  speaks of her with pride, but the conditions of his work keep
  him a modest man; for he goes about it under the concentred
  gaze of half a dozen old mariners hauled
  ashore, who haunt his yard uninvited, slow of speech but deadly
critical.

Nor has the language a word for their appalling candour.

Often, admiring how cheerfully he tolerates them, I have wondered
what it would feel like to compose a novel under the eyes of half
a dozen reviewers.

But to him, as to his critics, the ship was a framework only until the
terrible moment when with baptism she took life. Did he in the rapture,
the brief ecstasy of creation, realise that she had passed from him? Ere
the local artillery band had finished 'Rule Britannia,' and while
his friends were still shaking his hands and drinking to him, did
he know his loss in his triumph?

His fate is to improve the world, not to possess; to chase perfection,
knowing that under the final mastering touch it must pass from his
hand; to lose his works and anchor himself upon the workmanship,
the immaterial function.

For of art this is the cross and crown in one; and he, modest man,
was born to the sad eminence.

She is ours now by purchase, but ours, too, by something better. Like a
slave's her beautiful untaught body came to us; but it was we who
gave wings to her, and with wings a soul, and a law to its grace,
and discipline to its vital impulses.

She is ours, too, by our gratitude, since the delicate machine:

"Has like a woman given up its joy;"
And by memories of her helpfulness in such modest perils as we
tempt, of her sweet companionship through long days empty of
annoyance--land left behind with its striving crowds, its short
views, its idols of the market-place, its sordid worries; the breast
flung wide to the horizon, swept by wholesome salt airs, void
perhaps, but so beatifically clean!

Then it was that we learned her worth, drinking in the knowledge without
effort, lulled hour after hour by her whisperings which asked for
no answer, by the pulse of her tiller soft against the palm.

Patter of reef-points, creak of cordage, hum of wind, hiss of
brine--I think at times that she has found a more human language.

Who that has ever steered for hours together cannot report
of a mysterious voice 'breaking the silence of the seas,' as though a
    friend were standing and speaking
  astern? or has not turned his head to the confident
inexplicable call?
    The fishermen fable of drowned
  sailors 'hailing their names.' But the voice is of a
  single speaker; it bears no likeness to the hollow tones of the dead;
    it calls no name; it utters no
particular word. It merely speaks. Sometimes, ashamed at being
    tricked by an illusion so absurd, I steal a glance at the yachtsman
    forward. He is smoking, placidly staring at the clouds.
Patently he was not the speaker, and patently he has
heard nothing. Was it Cynthia, my dearer
shipmate? She, too, knows the voice; even
  answered it one day, supposing it mine, and in her confusion I
surprised our common secret.

But we never hear it together.

She is seated now on the lee side of the cockpit, her hands folded
on the coaming, her chin rested on them, and her eyes gazing out
beneath the sail and across the sea from which they surely have
drawn their wine-coloured glooms.

She has not stirred for many minutes.

No, it was not Cynthia.
Then either it must be the wild, obedient spirit who carries us,
straining at the impassable bar of speech, to break through and be at
one with her master, or else--Can it have been Ariel, perched aloft
in the shrouds, with mischievous harp?

"That was the chirp of Ariel You heard, as overhead it flew, The farther
going more to dwell And wing our green to wed our blue; But whether note
of joy or knell Not his own Father-singer knew; Nor yet can any mortal
tell, Save only how it shivers through; The breast of us a sounded shell,
The blood of us a lighted dew."

Perhaps; but for my part I believe it was the ship; and if you deride
my belief, I shall guess you one of those who need a figure-head to
remind them of a vessel's sex. There are minds which find a certain romance
in figure-heads. To me they seem a frigid, unintelligent device, not to
say idolatrous. I have known a crew to set so much store by one that they
kept a tinsel locket and pair of ear-rings in the forecastle and duly
adorned their darling when in port. But this is materialism. The true
personality of a ship resides in no prefiguring lump of wood with
a sightless smile to which all seas come alike and all weathers.

Lay your open palm on the mast, rather, and feel life pulsing beneath it,
trembling through and along every nerve of her. Are you converted? That
life is yours to control. Take the tiller, then, and for an hour be a
god!
For indeed you shall be a god, and of the very earliest. The centuries shall
run out with the chain as you slip moorings--run out and drop from you,
plumb, and leave you free, winged! Or if you cannot forget in a moment
the times to which you were born, each wave shall turn back a page as it
rolls past to break on the shore towards which you revert no glance.
Even the romance of it shall fade with the murmur of that coast.

"Sails of silk and ropes of sendal, Such as gleam in ancient lore, And the
singing of the sailor, And the answer from the shore--"
These shall pass and leave you younger than romance--a child
open-eyed and curious, pleased to meet a sea-parrot or a rolling
porpoise, or to watch the gannets diving--
"As Noah saw them dive O'er sunken Ararat."
Yes, and sunset shall bring you, a god, to the gates of a kingdom I must
pause to describe for you, though when you reach it you will forget my
description and imagine yourself its first discoverer. But that is a
part of its charm.

Walter Pater, reading the _Odyssey_, was brought up (as we say) 'with a
round turn' by a passage wherein Homer describes briefly and with
accuracy how some mariners came to harbour, took down sail, and
stepped ashore.
It filled him with wonder that so simple an incident--nor to say
ordinary --could be made so poetical; and, having pondered it, he
divided the credit between the poet and his fortunate age--a time
(said he) in which one could hardly have spoken at all without ideal
effect, or the sailors pulled down their boat without making a
picture 'in the great style' against a sky charged with marvels.

You will discover, when you reach the river-mouth of
which I am telling, and are swept over the rolling bar into quiet
water--you will discover (and with ease, being a god) that Mr. Pater
was entirely mistaken, and the credit belongs neither to Homer nor
to his fortunate age.

For here are woods with woodlanders, and fields with ploughmen, and beaches
with fishermen hauling nets; and all these men, as they go about their
work, contrive to make pictures 'in the great style' against a sky
charged with marvels, obviously without any assistance from Homer, and
quite as if nothing had happened for, say, the last three thousand years.
That the immemorial craft of seafaring has no specially 'heroic age'--or
that, if it have, that age is yours--you will discover by watching
your own yachtsman as he moves about lowering foresail and preparing
to drop anchor.

It is a river of gradual golden sunsets, such as Wilson painted--a
broad-bosomed flood between deep and tranquil woods, the main banks
holding here and there a village as in an arm maternally crook'd, but
opening into creeks where the oaks dip their branches in the high tides,
where the stars are glassed all night long without a ripple, and where
you may spend whole days with no company but herons and sandpipers. Even
by the main river each separate figure--the fisherman on the shore, the
ploughman on the upland, the ferryman crossing between them--moves slowly
upon a large landscape, while, permeating all, 'the essential silence
cheers and blesses.'

After a week at anchor in the heart of this silence Cynthia and I
compared notes, and set down the total population at fifty souls; and
even so she would have it that I had included the owls.
Lo! the next morning an unaccustomed rocking awoke us in our berths, and,
raising the flap of our dew-drenched awning, we 'descried at sunrise an
emerging prow' of a peculiarly hideous excursion steamboat. She blew no
whistle, and we were preparing to laugh at her grotesque temerity when we
became aware of a score of boats putting out towards her from the
shadowy banks. Like spectres they approached, reached her, and
discharged their complements, until at last a hundred and fifty
passengers crowded her deck.

In silence--or in such silence as a paddle-boat can achieve--she
backed, turned, and bore them away: on what festal errand we never
discovered.

We never saw them return. For aught I know they may never have returned.
They raised no cheer; no band accompanied them; they passed without even
the faint hum of conversation. In five minutes at most the apparition
had vanished around the river-bend seawards and out of sight. We stared
at the gently heaving water, turned, and caught sight of Euergetes, his
head and red cap above the forecastle hatch.

       (I call our yachtsman Euergetes
      because it is so
     unlike his real name
      that neither
       he nor his family
      will recognise it.) "Why,
     Euergetes," exclaimed
    Cynthia, "wherever did they all
      come from?"

"I'm sure I can't tell you, ma'am," he answered, "unless 'twas from the
woods,"--giving us to picture these ardent holiday-makers roosting
all night in the trees while we slumbered.
But the odd thing was that the labourers manned the fields that day, the
fishermen the beach that evening, in un-diminished numbers. We landed,
and could detect no depletion in the village. We landed on subsequent days,
and discovered no increase. And the inference, though easy, was startling.

I suppose that 'in the great style' could hardly be predicated of our
housekeeping on these excursions; and yet it achieves, in our
enthusiastic opinion, a primitive elegance not often recaptured by
mortals since the passing of the Golden Age.

We cook for ourselves, but bring a fine spirit of emulation both to
_cuisine_ and service. We dine frugally, but the claret is sound. From
the moment when Euergetes awakes us by washing down the deck, and the
sound of water rushing through the scuppers calls me forth to discuss the
weather with him, method rules the early hours, that we may be free to
use the later as we list. First the cockpit beneath the awning must be
prepared as a dressing-room for Cynthia; next Euergetes summoned on deck
to valet me with the simple bucket. And when I am dressed and
tingling from the _douche_, and sit me down on the cabin top, barefooted
and whistling, to clean the boots, and Euergetes has been sent ashore for
milk and eggs, bread and clotted cream, there follows a peaceful half-hour
until Cynthia flings back a corner of the awning and, emerging,
confirms the dawn.

Then begins the business, orderly and thorough, of redding up the cabin,
stowing the beds, washing out the lower deck, folding away the awning,
and transforming the cockpit into a breakfast-room, with table neatly set
forth. Meanwhile Euergetes has returned, and from the forecastle comes
the sputter of red mullet cooking.
Cynthia clatters the cups and saucers, while in the well by the cabin door
I perform some acquired tricks with the new-laid eggs. There is plenty
to be done on board a small boat, but it is all simple enough.
They were to be maintained by the municipality, without
any state encouragement beyond some grants for capable teachers and
scholarships in the Lycées for meritorious pupils.

Within two years after the enactment of the Law of 1802 there had been
created in France 46 Lycées, 378 secondary schools of various degrees of
completeness, and 361 private schools of secondary grade had been opened.
A number of these disappeared later, in the reorganization of 1808. For
the supervision of all these institutions the Director General of Public
Instruction appointed three Superintendents of Secondary Studies; and for
the work of the schools he outlined the courses of instruction in detail,
laid down the rules of administration, prepared and selected the
textbooks, and appointed the "professors."

SPECIAL OR HIGHER SCHOOLS. The chapter of the Law of 1802 on Special
Schools made provision for the creation of the following special
"faculties" or schools for higher education for France:

    3 medical schools, to replace the _Schools of Health_ of 1794 (p.
      518).
   10 law schools; increased to 12 in 1804 (Date of _Code Napoléon_,
      p. 518).
    4 schools of natural history, natural philosophy, and chemistry.
    2 schools of mechanical and chemical arts,
    1 mathematical school,
    1 school of geography, history, and political economy.
      A fourth school of art and design.
      Professors of astronomy for the observatories.

In 1803 the School of Arts and Trades was added (R. 282), and in 1804,
after Napoleon had signed the Concordat with the Pope, thus restoring the
Catholic religion (abolished 1791), schools of theology were added to the
above list.

We have here, clearly outlined, the main paths along which French state
educational organization had been tending and was in future to follow. The
State had definitely dispossessed the Church as the controlling agency in
education, and had definitely taken over the school as an instrument for
its own ends. Though primary education had been temporarily left to the
communes, and was soon to be turned over in large part to be handled by
the Church for a generation longer, the supervision was to remain with the
State. The middle-class elements were well provided for in the new
secondary schools, and these were now subject to complete supervision by
the State. For higher education groups of Special Schools, or Teaching
Faculties, replaced the older universities, which were not re-created
until after the coming of the Third Republic (1871). The dominant
characteristics of the state educational system thus created, aside from
its emphasis on secondary and higher education, were its uniformity and
centralized control. These characteristics were further stressed in the
reorganization of 1808, and have remained prominent in French educational
organization ever since.

CREATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FRANCE. By 1806 Napoleon was ready for a
further and more complete organization of the public instruction of the
State, and to this end the following law was now enacted (May 10, 1806):

    Sec. 1. There will be formed, under the name of Imperial University,
    a body exclusively commissioned with teaching and public education
    throughout the Empire.

    Sec. 2. The members of this corporation can contract civil, special,
    and temporary obligations.

    Sec. 3. The organization of this corps will be given in the form of a
    law to the legislative body in the session of 1810.

In 1808, without the formality of further legislation, Napoleon issued an
Imperial Decree creating the University of France. This was not only
Napoleon's most remarkable educational creation, but it was an
administrative and governing organization for education so in harmony with
French spirit and French governmental ideas that it has persisted ever
since, though changed somewhat in form with time.

The Decree began by declaring that "public instruction, in the whole
Empire, is confined exclusively to the University," and that "no school,
nor establishment for instruction, can be formed independent of the
Imperial University, and without the authority of its chief." Unlike the
University of Berlin (p. 574), created a year later, this was not a
teaching university at all, but instead a governing, examining, and
disbursing corporation, [3] presided over by a Grand Master and a Council
of twenty-six members, all appointed by the Emperor. This Council decided
all matters of importance, and exercised supervision and control over
education of all kinds, from the lowest to the highest, throughout France.
[4] To assist the Council, general inspectors for medicine, law, theology,
letters, and science were provided for, to visit and "examine the
condition of instruction and discipline in the faculties, _lycées_, and
colleges; to inform themselves in regard to the fidelity and ability of
professors, regents, and ushers; to examine the students; and to make a
complete survey of those institutions, in their whole administration."
Beneath the Grand Master and Council the State was divided into twenty-
seven "Academies" (administrative districts), each of which had a Rector,
a Council of ten, and Inspectors, all appointed by the Grand Master. These
exercised jurisdiction over teachers and pupils in all schools, and
decided all local matters, subject to appeal to the Grand Master and
Council.

Under this new administrative organization but little change was made in
the schools from that provided for in the law of 1802. Primary education
remained as before, private schools and Church schools supplying most of
the need. All were under the supervision of the University, and all were
instructed to make as a basis of their instruction: (1) the precepts of
the Catholic religion; (2) fidelity to the Emperor, to the imperial
monarchy, the depository of the happiness of the people, and to the
Napoleonic dynasty, the conservator of the unity of France, and of all the
ideas proclaimed by the Constitution.

The _Lycées_ and Communal Colleges continued, much as before, [5] and
during the half-century which followed, experienced a steady and
substantial growth.

The Special Higher Schools were also continued, and to the list given (p.
593) Napoleon added (1808) a Superior Normal School (R. 283) to train
graduates of the _Lycées_ for teaching. This opened in 1810, with thirty-
seven students and a two-year course of instruction, and in 1815 a third
year of method and practice work was added. With some varying fortunes,
this institution has continued to the present.

THE NEW INTEREST IN PRIMARY EDUCATION. The period from 1815 to 1830 in
France is known as the Restoration. Louis XVIII was made King and ruled
until his death in 1824, and his brother Charles X who followed until
deposed by the Revolution of 1830. Though a representative of the old
régime was recalled on the abdication of Napoleon, the great social gains
of the Revolution were retained. There was no odious restoration of
privilege and absolute monarchy. Frenchmen continued to be equal before
the law; a form of constitutional government was provided; the right of
petition was recognized; and the system of public instruction as Napoleon
had organized it continued almost unchanged. For a decade at least there
was less political reaction in France than in other continental States.

In matters of education, what had been provided was retained, and there
seems (R. 285) to have been an increasing demand for additions and
improvements, particularly in the matter of primary and middle-class
schools, and a willingness on the part of the communes to provide such
advantages. Some small progress had been made in meeting these demands,
before 1830.

In 1816 a small treasury grant (50,000 francs) was made for school books,
model schools, and deserving teachers in the primary schools, and in 1829
this sum was increased to 300,000 francs. In 1818 the "Brothers of the
Christian Schools" were permitted to be certificated for teaching on
merely presenting their Letter of Obedience from the head of their Order,
and in 1824 the cantonal school committees were remodeled so as to give
the bishops and clergy entire control of all Catholic primary schools.
Monitorial instruction was introduced from England by private teachers, in
an effort to supply the beginnings of education at small expense, and for
a time this had some vogue, but never proved very successful. In 1815 the
_Lycées_ were renamed Royal Colleges, but in 1848 the old name was
restored, and has since been retained. In 1817 there were thirty-six
_Lycées_, receiving an annual state subsidy of 812,000 francs; thirty
years later the fifty-four in existence were receiving 1,500,000 francs.
From 1822 to 1829 the Higher Normal School was suppressed, and twelve
elementary normal schools were created in its stead.

EARLY WORK UNDER THE MONARCHY OF 1830. In July, 1830, Charles X attempted
to suppress constitutional liberty, and the people rose in revolt and
deposed him, and gave the crown to a new King, Louis-Philippe. He ruled
until deposed by the creation of the Second Republic, in 1848. The
"Monarchy of 1830" was supported by the leading thinkers of the time,
prominent among whom were Thiers and Guizot, and one of the first affairs
of State to which they turned their attention was the extension downward
of the system of public instruction. The first steps were an increase of
the state grant for primary schools (1830) to a million francs a year; the
overthrow of the control by the priests of the cantonal school committees
(1830): the abolition (1831) of the exemption of the religious orders from
the examinations for teaching certificates; and the creation (1830-31) of
thirty new normal schools.

[Illustration: FIG. 176 VICTOR COUSIN (1792-1867)]

The next step was to send (1831) M. Victor Cousin--Director of the
restored Higher Normal School of France--on a mission to the German
States, and in particular to Prussia, to study and report on the system of
elementary education, teacher training, and educational organization and
administration which had done so much for its regeneration. So convincing
was Cousin's _Report_ [6] that, despite bitter national antipathies, it
carried conviction throughout France. "It demonstrated to the government
and the people the immense superiority of all the German States, even the
most insignificant duchy, over any and every Department of France, in all
that concerned institutions of primary and secondary education." Cousin
pronounced the school law of Prussia (R. 280) "the most comprehensive and
perfect legislative measure regarding primary education" with which he was
acquainted, and declared his conviction that "in the present state of
things, a law concerning primary education is indispensable in France."
The chief question, he continued, was "how to procure a good one in a
country where there is a total absence of all precedents and experience in
so grave a matter." Cousin then pointed out the bases, derived from
Prussian experience and French historical development, on which a
satisfactory law could be framed (R. 284 a-c); the desirability of local
control and liberty in instruction (R. 284 f-g); and strongly recommended
the organization of higher primary schools (a new creation; first
recommended (1792) by Condorcet, p. 514) as well as primary schools (R.
284 e) to meet the educational needs of the middle classes of the
population of France.

THE LAW OF 1833. On the basis of Cousin's _Report_ a bill, making the
maintenance of primary schools obligatory on every commune; providing for
higher primary schools in the towns and cities; additional normal schools
to train teachers for these schools; a corps of primary-school inspectors,
to represent the State; and normal training and state certification
required to teach in any primary school, was prepared. In an address to
the Chamber of Deputies, in introducing the bill (1832), M. Guizot [7],
the newly appointed Minister for Public Instruction, set forth the history
of primary instruction in France up to 1832 (R. 285 a); described the two
grades of primary instruction to be created (R. 285 b); and, emphasizing
Cousin's maxim that "the schoolmaster makes the school," dwelt on the
necessity for normal training and state certification for all primary
teachers (R. 285 c). In preparing the bill it was decided not to follow
the revolutionary ideas of free instruction, by lay and state teachers, or
to enforce compulsion to attend, and for these omissions M. Guizot, in his
_Mémoires_ (R. 286), gives some very interesting reasons.

[Illustration:  FIG. 177. OUTLINE OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE FRENCH STATE
SCHOOL SYSTEM]

The bill became a law the following year, and is known officially as the
Law of 1833. This Law forms the foundations upon which the French system
of national elementary education has been developed, as the Napoleonic Law
of 1802 and the Decree of 1808 have formed the basis for secondary
education and French state administrative organization. A primary school
was to be established in every commune, which was to provide the building,
pay a fixed minimum salary to the teacher, and where able maintain the
school.  The state reserved the right to fix the pay of the teacher, and
even to approve his appointment.  A tuition fee was to be paid for
attendance, but those who could not pay were to be provided with free
places. The primary schools were to give instruction in reading, writing,
arithmetic, the weights and measures, the French language, and morals and
religion. The higher primary schools were to build on these subjects, and
to offer instruction in geometry and its applications, linear drawing,
surveying, physical science, natural history, history, geography, and
music, and were to emphasize instruction in "the history and geography of
France, and in the elements of science, as they apply it every day in the
office, the workshop, and the field." [8] These latter were the
_Bürgerschulen_, recommended by Cousin (R. 284 e) on the basis of his
study of Prussian education. [9]

[Illustration: PLATE 14. FRANÇOIS PIERRE GUILLAUME GUIZOT (1787-1874)
Creator of the French primary school system]

The primary schools were to follow a uniform plan, and as a guide a
_Manual of Primary Instruction_ was issued, giving detailed directions as
to what was to be done. In sending out a copy of the Law to the primary
teachers of France, M. Guizot enclosed a personal letter to each,
informing him as to what the government expected of him in the new work
(R. 287). During the four years that M. Guizot remained Minister of Public
Instruction he rendered a remarkable service, well described by Matthew
Arnold (R. 288), in awakening his countrymen to the new problem of popular
education then before them.

The results under the Law of 1833 were large [10] and the subsequent
legislation under the monarchy of 1830 was important. For the first time
in French history an earnest effort was made to provide education suited
to the needs of the great mass of the people, and the marked development
of schools which ensued showed how eagerly they embraced the opportunities
offered their children, though the schooling was neither compulsory nor
gratuitous.  In 1837 Infant Schools, for still younger children, were
authorized, and in 1840 state aid for these was begun. In 1836 classes for
adults, first begun in Paris in 1820, were authorized generally, but it
was not until 1867 that these were formally incorporated into the state
school system. In 1845 state aid for the Communal Colleges, as well as for
the _Lycées_, was begun.

REACTION AFTER 1848. In France, as in Europe generally, the people were
steadily becoming more liberal, as they became better educated, while the
rulers were becoming more autocratic. The result was the series of
revolutions of 1848, which broke out first in France, and finally extended
to most of the countries of continental Europe. In France the King, Louis-
Philippe, was forced to abdicate; a Republic, based on universal manhood
suffrage, was proclaimed; and Louis Napoleon, a nephew of Napoleon I, was
elected President. In 1851 Napoleon established himself as Dictator;
prepared a new constitution providing for an Empire; and, in 1852,
dissolved the Second Republic and assumed the title of Emperor Napoleon
III. This Second Empire lasted until 1870, when France was humiliated by
the Prussians as the latter had been by Napoleon I in 1806. The Emperor
and his armies were taken prisoners (1870) and, in 1871, the Prussians
occupied Paris and crowned the new Emperor of united and Imperial Germany
in the palace of the French Kings at Versailles. A Third Republic now
succeeded, and this has lasted to the present time.

The period from 1848 to 1870 in France was a period of middle-class rule,
and reaction in education as in government. In 1848 a Sub-Commission on
Primary Education reported in opposition to the state primary schools. The
troubles of 1848 had brought to view the political restlessness which had
taken possession of the teachers, as well as other classes in society. The
new schools were naturally suspected of being the source of the popular
discontent. Many teachers had sympathized with, and some had taken part in
the disturbances, and teachers generally were now placed under close
surveillance. Some of the leaders were forced into exile until after 1870.
Religious schools, regarded as more favorable to monarchical needs and
purposes, were now encouraged, and the number of religious schools
increased from 6464 in 1850, to 11,391 by 1864. Private schools, too, were
given full freedom to compete with the state schools, and the pay of the
primary teachers was reduced. The course in the normal schools was
condemned as too ambitious, and, in 1851, was cut down. The course of
instruction in the primary schools, on the other hand, was, unlike in
Prussia, broadened instead of restricted, and in particular emphasis was
placed, in keeping with nearly a century of French tradition, on
scientific and practical subjects. [11] The law of 1850 stated the
requirements for primary schools as follows:

    Art. 23. Primary instruction comprises moral and religious
    instruction, reading, writing, the elements of the French language,
    computation, and the legal system of weights and measures. It may
    comprise, in addition, arithmetic applied to practical operations, the
    elements of history (a required subject after 1867) and geography,
    notions of the physical sciences and of natural history applicable to
    the ordinary purposes of life, elementary instruction in agriculture,
    trade, and hygiene; and surveying, leveling, linear drawing, singing,
    and gymnastics.

Religious instruction prospered under the Second Empire, and the state
primary schools lost in importance. The _Lycées_ continued largely as
classical institutions, though after 1865 the crowding of the rising
sciences began to dispute the supremacy of classical studies.  There were,
however, many voices of discontent, particularly from exiled teachers (R.
289), and the way was rapidly being prepared for the creation of a
stronger and better state school system as soon as political conditions
were propitious.

REVOLUTIONARY IDEALS AT LAST REALIZED.  With the creation of the Third
Republic, in 1870, a change from the old conditions and old attitudes took
place.  Up to about 1879 the new government was in control of those who
were at heart sympathetic with the old conditions, but were forced to
accept the new; from 1879 to 1890 was a transition period; and since 1890
the Republic has grown steadily in strength and regained its position
among the great powers of the world.  The first few years of the new
Republic were devoted to paying the Prussian indemnity and clearing the
soil of France of German armies, but, after about 1875, education became a
great national interest among leaders of France. [12] France saw, somewhat
as did Prussia after 1806, the necessity for creating a strong state
system of primary, secondary, and higher schools to train the youth of the
land in the principles of the Republic, strengthen the national spirit,
advance the welfare of the State, and protect it from dangers both within
and without.

    1901     4.4       4.4    6.3

Millions were put into the building of schoolhouses (1878-88); new normal
schools were established; a normal school for women was created in each of
the eighty-seven departments of France; the academic and superior councils
of public instruction were reorganized to eliminate clerical influences
(1881); religious instruction was replaced by moral and civic instruction
(R. 290); and clerical "Letters of Obedience" were no longer accepted, and
all teachers were required to be certificated by the State. The Law of
1881, eliminating instruction in religion from the elementary schools, was
followed, in 1886, by a law providing for the gradual replacement of
clerical by lay teachers. In 1904, the teaching congregations of France
were suppressed. All elementary education now became public, free,
compulsory, and secular, [13] and teachers were required to be neutral in
religious matters. [14]

Since 1871, also, technical and scientific education has been emphasized;
the primary and superior-primary schools have been made free (1881) and
compulsory (1882); classes for adults have been begun generally; the state
aid for schools has been very greatly increased; _lycées_ and colleges for
women have been created (1880); the _lycées_ modernized in their
instruction [15] and the reorganization and reëstablishment of a series of
fifteen state universities of a modern type, begun in 1885, was completed
in 1896. The reorganization and expansion of education in France since
1875 is a wonderful example of republican interest and energy, and is
along entirely different lines from those followed, since the same date,
in German lands.

After the lapse of nearly a century we now see the French Revolutionary
ideas of gratuity, obligation, and secularization finally put into effect,
and the state system of public instruction outlined by Condorcet (p. 514),
in 1792, at last an accomplished fact.


II. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ITALY

IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK OF NAPOLEON. So much has been written about the
deluge of blood that took place in Paris in the days of the Commune and
the time of the National Conventions, and of the military victories and
autocratic rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, that it is difficult to appraise
the importance of either, from the point of view of the progress of
civilization and of the organization of modern political institutions, at
its true worth. The faults of both are prominent and outstanding, but it
nevertheless was the merit of the Revolution that it enabled France, and
along with France a good portion of western Europe, to rid itself of the
worst survivals of the Middle Ages, while to Napoleon much of western
Europe is indebted for the foundation of its civil institutions, unified
legal procedure, beginnings of state educational organization, and modern
governmental forms. Writing on this subject, Matthew Arnold [16] well
said:

    With all his faults, his [Napoleon's] reason was so clear and strong
    that he saw, in its general outlines at least, the just and rational
    type of civil organization which modern society needs, and wherever
    his armies went he instituted it.

[Illustration: FIG. 178. EUROPE IN 1810
Showing the control of France when Napoleon was at the height of his
power.]

That the French Revolution's merit and service was a real one is shown by
all the world, as it improves, getting rid more and more of the Middle
Ages. That Napoleon's merit and service was a real one is shown by the bad
governments which succeeded him having always got rid, when they could, of
his work, and by the progress of improvement, when these governments
became intolerable, and are themselves got rid of, always bringing it
back. Where governments were not wholly bad, and did not get rid of
Napoleon's good work, this work turns out to have the future on its side,
and to be more likely to assimilate the institutions round it to its
pattern than to be itself assimilated by them.

In the Italian States, the Netherlands, some of the French cantons of
Switzerland, the Rhine countries, and the Danish peninsula, in particular,
the rule of Napoleon, imposed by his armies, carried out by rulers of his
selection, and maintained for a long enough period that the legal
organization, civil order, unified government, and taste of educational
opportunities of a new type which his rule brought became attractive to
the people, in time proved deeply influential in their political
development. [17] All these nations still show traces of the French
influence in their state educational organization. We shall take the
Italian States as a type, and examine briefly the influence on the
development of state educational organization there which resulted from
contact with the forward-looking rule of "The Great Emperor."

DECLINE IN IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION IN ITALY. In a preceding chapter (p.
503), we mentioned that the rule of Napoleon in northern Italy awakened
the national spirit from its long lethargy, and caused Italian liberals to
look forward, for the first time since the days of the Revival of
Learning, to the time when the Italian States might be united into one
Italian nation, with Rome as its capital. This became the work of the mid-
nineteenth century (see dates, Fig. 179), though not fully completed until
the World War of 1914-18. Italy stands to-day a great united nation, with
a large future ahead of it, but as such it is entirely a nineteenth-
century creation. From the time of its intellectual decline following the
Renaissance, to the middle of the nineteenth century, Italy remained "a
geographical expression" and split up into a number of little independent
States; up to the time of Napoleon it was a part of the German-ruled "Holy
Roman Empire."

After the great patriotic effort of the period of the Revival of Learning
(p. 264) in Italy, and the rather feeble and unsuccessful attempts at a
reform of religion which followed, the intellectual development of Italy
was checked and turned aside for centuries by the triumph of an
unprogressive and anti-intellectual attitude on the part of the dominant
Church. The persecution of Galileo (p. 388) was but a phase of the
reaction in religion which had by that time set in. Education was turned
over to the religious orders, such as the Jesuits and the Barnabites, and
instruction was turned aside from liberal culture and the promotion of
learning to the support of a religion and the stamping out of heresy.
Though a number of educational foundations were made, and some important
undertakings begun after the days when her universities were crowded and
Florence and Venice vied with one another for the intellectual supremacy
of the western world, the spirit nevertheless was gone, and both education
and government settled down to a tenacious preservation of the existing
order. Scholars ceased to frequent the schools of Italy; the universities
changed from seats of learning to degree-conferring institutions; [18] the
intellectual capitals came to be found north of the Alps; and the history
of educational progress ceased to be traced in this ancient land. In the
early part of the eighteenth century the schools there reached perhaps
their lowest intellectual level.

THE BEGINNINGS OF REFORM IN SAVOY. The first and almost the only attempt
to change this condition, before Napoleon's armies went crashing through
the valley of the Po, was made in the seventeenth century by two Dukes of
Savoy. By decrees of 1729 and 1772 they took the control of the secondary
(Latin) schools in their little duchy from the religious orders, and
established a Council of Public Instruction to reform the university
examinations, see that teachers were prepared for the Latin schools, and
take over in the name of the authorities of the duchy the control of
education. Though inspired by a political interest, the two dukes brought
into their little kingdom the much-needed ideas of honest work, effective
administration, and public spirit, and laid the foundations for the
control of education by the public authorities later on. The only other
attempt to improve conditions came in Lombardy, in 1774, which then was a
part of the Austrian dominions and felt the short-lived reforms of Maria
Theresa (p. 562; R. 276). Elsewhere in Italy conditions remained unchanged
until the time of Napoleon.

NAPOLEON REVIVES THE NATIONAL SPIRIT. In 1796 Napoleon's armies invaded
Sardinia, Lombardy, and the valley of the Po, and he soon extended his
control to almost all the Italian peninsula. For nearly two decades
thereafter this collection of little States felt the unifying,
regenerating influence of the organizing French. Monasteries and convents
and religious schools were transformed into modern teaching institutions,
brigandage was put down, and efficient and honest government was
established. The ideas of the French Law of 1802 as to education were
applied. Every town was ordered to establish a school for boys, to teach
the reading and writing of Italian and the elements of French and Latin;
the secondary schools were modernized; and the universities were
completely reorganized. Some of the universities were reduced to _licei_
(_lycées_; secondary schools), while others were strengthened and their
revenues turned to better purposes. The universities at Naples and Turin
in particular were transformed into strong institutions, with a decided
emphasis on scientific studies. A normal school was founded at Pisa, on
the model of the one at Paris. New standards in education were set up, the
study of the sciences was introduced into the secondary schools, and the
study of medicine and law was regenerated.

With the fall of Napoleon his work was largely undone. The firm, just, and
intelligent government which he had given Italy--something the land had
not known for ages--came to an end. The little States were "handed back to
the reactionary dynasts whose rule was neither benevolent nor intelligent,
while the ever-ready Austrian army crushed out any local movement for
liberal institutions." The laws regarding education were repealed, and the
schools the French had established were closed as revolutionary and
dangerous. The normal school at Pisa ceased to exist; the university at
Naples was dismantled; the one at Turin was closed; and the Jesuits were
allowed to return and reorganize instruction. The result was that a common
discontent with ensuing conditions made Italians conscious of their racial
and historical unity, and this finally expressed itself in the revolutions
of 1848. These failed at the time, and the heel of the Austrian oppressor
came down harder than before. Liberty of the press practically ceased. The
national leaders went into exile for safety. The prisons were filled with
political offenders. The schools were closed or ceased to influence. The
Pope, fearing the end of his earthly kingship approaching, united firmly
with the Austrians to resist liberal movements. Finally, under the
leadership of the enlightened King of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel (1849-78)
and his Prime Minister, Count of Cavour, the Austrians were driven out
(1859-66) and all Italy was united (1870) under the rule of one king
interested in promoting the welfare of his people.

[Illustration: FIG. 179. THE UNIFICATION OF ITALY, SINCE 1848]

SARDINIA LEADS TO NATIONAL ORGANIZATION AND CONTROL. The movement to free
Italy was essentially a liberal movement. Many hoped to create a republic,
but chose a liberal constitutional monarchy under Victor Emmanuel as the
most feasible plan. Cavour understood the importance of public
instruction, and from the first began to build up schools [19] and put
them under state control. In 1844, a normal school was opened in Turin. In
1847, a Minister of Public Instruction was appointed and a Council of
Public Instruction created, after the plan of France, In 1848, a General
School Law was enacted, and the organization and improvement of schools
was begun with a will. In 1850, a commission was sent to study the school
systems of Europe, and in particular those of France and of the German
States. A Supreme Council of Public Instruction was now formed for
Sardinia, and the process of creating primary schools, higher-primary
schools, classical and technical secondary schools, colleges, and the
reorganization of the universities was begun. In 1859, when the growth of
Italian unity was rapidly extending the rule of Victor Emmanuel, [20] a
new law, providing a still better state organization of public
instruction, was enacted. A Minister of Public Instruction appointed by
the King, a Supreme Council of Public Instruction, and a Department of
Public Instruction as a branch of the government, were all provided for,
after the French plan.

[Illustration: FIG. 180 COUNT OF CAVOUR (1810-61)]

This Law of 1859 was later extended to cover all Italy, and has formed the
basis for all subsequent legislation. It clearly established a state
system of education, though the religious schools were allowed to remain.
It also established control after the French plan, with a high degree of
centralization and uniformity. The schools established, too, were much
after the French type, though much less extensive in scope. The primary
and superior primary at first were but two years each, though since
extended in all the larger communities to a six-year combined course. The
two-class school system was established, as in France and German lands.
The secondary-school system consisted of a five-year _ginnasio_,
established in many places (218 in Italy by 1865; 458 by 1916) with a
three-year _liceo_ following, but found in a smaller number of places.
Parallel with this a seven-year non-classical scientific and technical
secondary school was also created, and these institutions have made marked
headway (461 by 1916) in central and northern Italy. Pupils may pass to
either of these on the completion of the ordinary four-year primary
course, at the age of ten. Above the secondary schools are numerous
universities. The normal-school system created prepared for teaching in
the primary schools, while the university system followed the completion
of the _liceo_ course.  [Illustration: FIG. 181. OUTLINE OF THE MAIN
FEATURES OF THE ITALIAN STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM]

The influence of French ideas in Italian educational organization is
clearly evident. Before the French armies brought French governmental
ideas and organization to Italy almost nothing had been done. Then, during
the first six decades of the nineteenth century, the transition from the
church-school idea to the conception of education as an important function
of the State was made, and the resulting system is largely French in
organization and form.

SUBSEQUENT PROGRESS. From this point on educational progress has been
chiefly a problem of increased finances and the slow but gradual extension
of educational opportunities to more and more of the children of the
people. The church schools have been allowed to continue side by side with
the state schools, and the problem of securing satisfactory working
relations has not always been easy of solution.

In 1877 primary education was ordered made compulsory, [21] and religious
instruction was dropped from the state schools, but the slow progress of
the nation in extending literacy indicates that but little had been
accomplished in enforcing the compulsion previous to the new compulsory
law of 1904. This made more stringent provisions regarding schooling, and
provided for three thousand evening and Sunday schools for illiterate
adults. In 1906, an earnest effort was begun to extend educational
advantages in the southern provinces, where illiteracy has always been
highest. In 1911, the state aid for elementary education was materially
increased. In 1912, a new and more modern plan of studies for the
secondary schools was promulgated. Since 1912 many important advances have
been inaugurated, such as elementary schools of agriculture, vocational
schools, continuation schools, the middle-class industrial and commercial
schools. The World War directed new attention to the educational needs of
the nation. Italy, at last thoroughly awakened, seems destined to be a
great world power politically and commercially, and we may look forward to
seeing education used by the Italian State as a great constructive force
for the advancement of its national interests.

CHAPTER XXIV

THE STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND


I. THE CHARITABLE VOLUNTARY BEGINNINGS

ENGLISH PROGRESS A SLOW BUT PEACEFUL EVOLUTION. The beginnings of national
educational organization in England were neither so simple nor so easy as
in the other lands we have described. So far this was in part due to the
long-established idea, on the part of the small ruling class, that
education was no business of the State; in part to the deeply ingrained
conception as to the religious purpose of all instruction; in part to the
fact that the controlling upper classes had for long been in possession of
an educational system which rendered satisfactory service in preparing
leaders for both Church and State; and in part--probably in large part--to
the fact that national evolution in England, since the time of the Civil
War (1642-49) has been a slow and peaceful growth, though accompanied by
much hard thinking and vigorous parliamentary fighting. Since the
Reformation (1534-39) and the Puritan uprising led by Cromwell (1642-49),
no civil strife has convulsed the land, destroyed old institutions, and
forced rapid changes in old established practices. Neither has the country
been in danger from foreign invasion since that memorable week in July,
1588, when Drake destroyed the Spanish Armada and made the future of
England as a world power secure.

English educational evolution has in consequence been slow, and changes
and progress have come only in response to much pressure, and usually as a
reluctant concession to avoid more serious trouble. A strong English
characteristic has been the ability to argue rather than fight out
questions of national policy; to exhibit marked tolerance of the opinions
of others during the discussion; and finally to recognize enough of the
proponents' point of view to be willing to make concessions sufficient to
arrive at an agreement. This has resulted in a slow but a peaceful
evolution, and this slow and peaceful evolution has for long been the
dominant characteristic of the political, social, and educational progress
of the English people. The whole history of the two centuries of evolution
toward a national system of education is a splendid illustration of this
essentially English characteristic.

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS. England, it will be remembered
(chapter XIX, Section III), had early made marked progress in both
political and religious liberty. Ahead of any other people we find there
the beginnings of democratic liberty, popular enlightenment, freedom of
the press, religious toleration, [1] social reform, and scientific and
industrial progress. All these influences awakened in England, earlier
than in any other European nation, a rather general desire to be able to
read (R. 170), and by the opening of the eighteenth century we find the
beginnings of a charitable and philanthropic movement on the part of the
churches and the upper classes to extend a knowledge of the elements of
learning to the poorer classes of the population.

As a result, as we have seen (chapter XVIII), the eighteenth century in
England, educationally, was characterized by a new attitude toward the
educational problem and a marked extension of educational opportunity.
Even before the beginning of the century the courts had taken a new
attitude toward church control of teaching, [2] and in 1700 had freed the
teacher of the elementary school from control by the bishops through
license. [3] In 1714 an Act of Parliament (13 Anne, c. 7) exempted
elementary schools from the penalties of conformity legislation, and they
were thereafter free to multiply and their teachers to teach. [4] The dame
school (R. 235) now became an established English institution (p. 447).
Private-adventure schools of a number of types arose (p. 451). The
churches here and there began to provide elementary parish-schools for the
children of their poorer members (p. 449), or training-schools for other
children who were to go out to service (R. 241). Workhouse schools and
"schools of industry" also were used to provide for orphans and the
children of paupers (p. 453).

THE CHARITY-SCHOOL SYSTEM. Most important of all was the organization, by
groups of individuals (R. 237) and by Societies (S.P.C.K.; p. 449) formed
for the purpose, and maintained by subscription (R. 240), collections (R.
291), and foundation incomes, of an extensive and well-organized system of
Charity-Schools (p. 449). The "Society for the Promotion of Christian
Knowledge" dates from the year 1699, and the "Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel in Foreign Parts" from 1701. The first worked at home, and
the second in the overseas colonies. [5] Both did much to provide schools
for poor boys and girls, furnishing them with clothing and instruction (R.
292), and training them in reading, writing, spelling, counting,
cleanliness, proper behavior, sewing and knitting (girls), and in "the
Rules and Principles of the Christian Religion as professed and taught in
the Church of England" (R. 238 b). The Charity-School idea was in a sense
an application of the joint-stock-company principle to the organization
and maintenance of an extensive system of schools for the education of the
children of the poor, the stock being subscribed for by humanitarian-
minded people. The upper classes had for long been well provided, through
tutors in the home and grammar schools and colleges, with those means for
education which have for centuries produced an able succession of
gentlemen, statesmen, governors, and scholars for England, and many of the
commercial middle-class had, by the eighteenth century, become able to
purchase similar advantages for their sons. These now united to provide,
as part of a great organized charity and under carefully selected teachers
(R. 238 a), for the more promising children of their poorer neighbors, the
elements of that education which they themselves had enjoyed.

The movement spread rapidly over England (p. 451), and soon developed into
a great national effort to raise the level of intelligence of the masses
of the English people. Thousands of persons gave their services as
directors, organizers, and teachers. Traveling superintendents were
employed. A rudimentary form of teacher-training was begun. The preaching
of a Charity Sermon each year [6] with a special collection, became a
general English practice.

THE VOLUNTARY SYSTEM. The rise of the Methodist movement, [7] after 1730
(p. 489); the earthquake shocks of 1750; the rise of the popular novel and
newspaper; the printing of political news, and cheap scientific pamphlets
(p. 492); and the growing tendency to debate questions and to apply reason
to their solution--all tended to give emphasis in England to these
eighteenth-century charitable means for extending education to the
children of those who could not afford to pay for it. Unlike the German
States, where the State and the Church and the school had all worked
together from the days of the Reformation on, the English had never known
such a conception. The efforts, though, of the educated few, in the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, to extend the elements of
learning, order, piety, cleanliness, and proper behavior to the children
of the masses, formed an important substitute for the action by the
Church-State which was so characteristic a feature of Teutonic lands.

We see in these eighteenth-century efforts the origin of what became known
in England as "the voluntary system" and upon this voluntary support of
education--private, parochial, charitable--the English people for long
relied. Of action by the State there was none during the eighteenth
century, aside from an Act of 1767 (7 Geo. III, c. 39) relating to the
education of pauper children. This established the important principle--
unfortunately not followed up--of providing that poor parish children of
London might be maintained and educated "at the cost of the rates."

THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL MOVEMENT. One other voluntary eighteenth-century
movement of importance in the history of English educational development
should be mentioned here, as it formed the connecting link between the
parochial-charity-school movement of the eighteenth century and the
philanthropic period of the educational reformers of the early nineteenth.
This was the Sunday-School movement, first tried by John Wesley in
Savannah, in 1737, but not introduced into England until 1763. The idea
amounted to little, though, until practically worked out anew (1780) by
Robert Raikes, a printer of Gloucester, and described by him (1783) in his
_Gloucester Journal_ (R. 293), after he had experimented with it for three
years. [8] His printed description of the Sunday-School idea gave a
national impulse to the movement, and Sunday Schools were soon established
all over England to take children off the streets on Sunday and provide
them with some form of secular and religious instruction. [9]

The movement coincided with new religious, social, and economic forces
which were at work, and which awakened an interest not only in the
education of the children of the poorer working-classes, but caused the
upper and middle classes in society to feel a new sense of responsibility
for social and educational reform. The cold and unemotional religion of
the English Church in the early eighteenth century had created an
indifference to the simple truths and duties of the Gospels. The great
religious revival under Wesley and Whitefield had challenged such an
attitude, and had done much to infuse a new spirit into religion and
awaken a new sense of responsibility for social welfare. The rapid growth
of population in the towns, following the beginnings of factory life (p.
493), had created new social and economic problems, and the neglect of
children in the manufacturing towns had shocked many thinking persons. The
way in which parents and children, freed from hard labor in the factories
on Sundays, abandoned themselves to vice, drunkenness, and profanity
caused many, among them Raikes himself (R. 293), to inquire if "something
could not be done" to turn into respectable men and women "the little
heathen of the neighborhood." The Sunday School was his answer, and the
answer of many all over England. [10]

In 1785 "The Society for the Support and Encouragement of Sunday Schools
in the different Counties of England" was formed with a view to
establishing a Sunday School in every parish in the kingdom, and the Queen
headed a subscription list, following a general appeal for funds. By 1787
it was estimated that 234,000 children in England and Wales were attending
a Sunday School, and by 1792 the number had increased to half a million.
The Parliamentary return for 1818 showed 5463 Sunday Schools in existence,
and 477,225 scholars; in 1835 the returns showed 1,548,890 scholars, half
of whom attended no other school, and approximately 160,000 voluntary
teachers. [11] In Manchester, then a city scourged with almost universal
child-labor, the schools (1834) were in session five and a half hours on
Sunday and two evenings a week. The moral and religious influence of these
schools was important, and the instruction in reading and writing, meager
as it was, filled a real need of the time.

OTHER VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS; "RAGGED SCHOOLS." The Charity Schools and the
Sunday Schools were the two most conspicuous of the voluntary-organization
type of undertakings for providing the poor children of England with the
elements of secular and religious education. Many other organizations of
an educational and charitable nature, aided also by many individual
efforts, too numerous to mention, were formed with the same charitable and
humanitarian end in view. Others, similar in type, charged a small fee,
and hence were of the private-adventure type. Sunday Schools, day schools,
evening schools, children's churches, bands of hope, clothing clubs,
messenger brigades, shoeblack brigades, orphans' schools, reformatory
schools, industrial schools, ragged schools--these were some of the types
that arose. Only one of these--"Ragged Schools"--will be described.

[Illustration: PLATE 15. JOHN POUNDS'S RAGGED SCHOOL AT PORTSMOUTH]

[Illustration: PLATE 16. AN ENGLISH VILLAGE VOLUNTARY SCHOOL
(Reproduced from an early nineteenth-century engraving, through the

The originator of the "Ragged Schools"--schools for the education of
destitute children, waifs and strays not reached by other agencies--was a
large-hearted cobbler of Portsmouth, by the name of John Pounds (1766-
1839), who divided his time between cobbling and rescue work among the
poorest and most degraded children of his neighborhood. His school is
shown in the picture facing this page. (Plate 15.) In his shoeshop he
taught such children, free of charge, to read, write, count, cook their
food, and mend their shoes. He was a schoolmaster, doctor, nurse, and
playfellow to them all in one. His workshop was a room of only six by
eighteen feet, yet in it he often had forty children under his
instruction. His work set an example, and "Ragged Schools," or "Schools
for the Destitute," began to be formed in many places by humanitarians.
These took the form of day schools, night schools, Sunday Schools, and the
so-called industrial schools (R. 294). The instruction in most of them was
entirely free, [12] but some charged a small fee, in a few cases as high
as a shilling a month. It was one of these schools that Crabbe described
when he wrote: [13]

  Poor Reuben Dixon has the noisiest school
  Of ragged lads, who ever bowed to rule;
  Low in his price--the men who heave our coals,
  And clean our causeways, send him boys in shoals.
  To see poor Reuben, with his fry beside-
  Their half-check'd rudeness and his half-scorned pride-
  Their room, the sty in which th' assembly meet,
  In the close lane behind the Northgate street;
  T' observe his vain attempts to keep the peace,
  Till tolls the bell, and strife and trouble cease,
  Calls for our praise; his labours praise deserves,
  But not our pity; Reuben has no nerves.
  'Mid noise and dirt, and stench, and play, and prate,
  He calmly cuts the pen or views the slate.

In 1844 "The Ragged School Union" was formed in London, and maintained
there many of the types of schools mentioned above. The "Constitution and
Rules of the Association for the Establishment of Ragged Industrial
Schools for Destitute Children in Edinburgh" (R. 294) gives a good idea as
to the nature, support, and instruction in such schools. As late as 1870,
when national education was first begun in England, there were about two
hundred of these Ragged Schools in London alone, with about 23,000
children in them. Upon many such forms of irregular schools England
depended before the days of national organization.

OTHER EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY INFLUENCES. During the latter half of the
eighteenth century French Revolutionary thought [14] and American
political action began to exert some influence on public opinion in
England. The small upper ruling class, alarmed at the developments in
France, became confirmed in its opposition to any general popular
education aside from a little reading, writing, counting, and careful
religious training, while on the other hand men of more liberal outlook
felt that popular enlightenment was a necessity to prevent the masses from
becoming stirred by inflammatory writings and speeches. The increasing
distress in the agricultural regions, due to the rapid change of England
from an agricultural to a manufacturing nation; the crowding of great
numbers of working people into the manufacturing towns; and the social
misery and political unrest following the Napoleonic wars all alike
contributed to a feeling of need for any form of philanthropic effort that
gave promise of alleviating the ills of society. There now grew up a small
but influential body of thinkers who favored the maintenance of a system
of general and compulsory education by the State, and the separation of
the school from the Church. The most notable proponents of this new theory
were Adam Smith, the Reverend T. R. Malthus, and the Anglo-American Thomas
Paine. The first approached the question from an economic point of view,
the second from an economic and biologic, and the third from the
political.  In 1776 Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_ appeared. This was
one of the great books of all time. Among other matters he dealt with the
question of education. He pointed out that English society was now
becoming highly organized; that the new manufacturing life had completely
changed the simple conditions of an earlier agricultural society; that in
the narrow round of manufacturing duties and town life people tended to
lose their inventiveness and to stagnate; and that the individual
degeneracy which set in in a more highly organized type of society became
a social danger of large magnitude. Hence, he argued (R. 295), it was a
matter of state interest that "the inferior ranks of the people" be
instructed to make them socially useful and to render them "less apt to be
misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to measures of
government." Accordingly, he held, the State had every right, not only to
take over elementary education as a state function and a public charge,
but also to make it free and compulsory.

[Illustration: FIG. 183. ADAM SMITH (1723-90)]

In 1798 the Reverend T. R. Malthus's _Essay on Population_ appeared. This
was a precursor of the work of Darwin, and another of the great books of
all time. He pointed out that population everywhere tended to outrun the
means of subsistence, and that it was only prevented from doing so by
preventive checks which involved much misery and vice and pauperism. To
prevent pauperism each individual must exercise moral restraint and
foresight, and to enable all to do this a widespread system of public
instruction was a necessity (R. 296). The money England had spent in poor-
relief he regarded as largely wasted, because it afforded no cure. In the
general education of a people the real solution lay. He said:

    We have lavished immense sums on the poor, which we have every reason
    to think have constantly tended to aggravate their misery,... It is
    surely a great national disgrace that the education of the lowest
    classes in England should be left to a few Sunday Schools, supported
    by a subscription from individuals, who can give to the course of
    instruction in them any kind of bias which they may please. (R 296.)

[Illustration: FIG. 184 REV. T. R. MALTHUS (1766-1834)]

Agreeing thoroughly with Adam Smith that a general diffusion of knowledge
was a safeguard to society, he urged the teaching of the elements of
political economy in the common schools to enable people to live better in
the new type of competitive society. [15]

In 1791-92 Thomas Paine published his widely read _Rights of Man_. He
expressed the French Revolutionary political theory, holding that
government, while capable of great good were its powers only properly
exercised, was, as organized, an evil. In a well-governed nation none
would be permitted to go uninstructed, he held, and he would cut off poor-
relief and make a state grant of £4 a year for every child under fourteen
for its education, and would compel parents to send all children to school
to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic.

Each of these three books had a long and a slowly cumulative influence,
and a small number of young and powerful champions of the idea of popular
education as a public charge began, early in the nineteenth century, to
urge action and to influence public opinion.


II. THE PERIOD OF PHILANTHROPIC EFFORT (1800-33)

CONDITIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. This second period
in the history of the organization of English education begins with the
publication, in 1797, of Dr. Andrew Bell's _An Experiment in Education_,
describing his work in educating large numbers of children by means of the
so-called mutual system, at the Male Asylum at Madras, India. The period
properly ends with the first Parliamentary grant for education, in 1833.
In its main characteristics it belongs to the eighteenth rather than to
the nineteenth century, as the prominent educational movements of the
eighteenth (charity-schools, Sunday Schools, schools of industry) continue
strong throughout the period, and many new undertakings of a similar
charitable nature ("Ragged Schools"; associations for the improvement of
the condition of the poor, etc.) were begun.

The period--during and after the Napoleonic wars--was one of marked social
and political unrest, and of corresponding emphasis on social and
philanthropic service. The masses were discontented with their lot, and
were beginning to be with their lack of political privileges. Numerous
plans to quiet the unrest and improve conditions were proposed, of which
schemes to increase employment (industrial schools; evening schools), to
encourage thrift (savings banks; children's brigades), and to spread an
elementary and religious education (mutual schools; infant schools) that
would train the poor in self-help were the most prominent. "The Society
for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor."
founded in 1796, became a very important early-nineteenth-century
institution. Branches were established all over England. Soup-kitchens,
clothing-stations, savings banks, and schools were among the chief lines
of activity. In particular it extended and improved Sunday Schools,
encouraged the formation of charity-schools and schools of industry, and
later gave much aid in establishing the new monitorial schools.
Educational interest steadily strengthened during the period, though as
yet along lines that were deemed relatively harmless, were inexpensive,
and were largely religious in character.

The eighteenth-century conception of education as a charity, designed
where given to train the poor to "an honest, upright, grateful, and
industrious poverty," still prevailed; there was as yet little thought of
education as designed to train the poor to think for and help themselves.
The eighteenth-century conception of the educational process, too, which
regarded education as something external and determined by adult standards
and needs, and to be imposed on the child from without, also continued.
The purpose of the school was to manufacture the standard man, and the
business of the teacher was to so organize and methodize instruction that
the necessary knowledge could be acquired as economically, from a
financial point of view, as possible. The Pestalozzian conception of
education as a development of the individual, according to the law of his
own nature, found but slow acceptance in England. Mental development,
scientific instruction, the habit of thinking, the exercise of judgment,
and free and enlightened opinion were ideas that found little favor there,
and hence had to be handled carefully by those who had caught the new
conception of the educational process.

In the political reaction following the end of Napoleon's rule the upper
and ruling classes of England, in common with those of continental lands,
became exceedingly suspicious of much education for the masses. To secure
contributions for schools it became necessary "to avow and plead how
little it was that the schools pretended or presumed to teach." [16]
England now experienced a great development of manufacturing and commerce,
a great material prosperity ensued, and the growing demand for education
was met by a counter-demand that the education provided should be
systematized, economical, and should not teach too much. Such a system of
training was now discovered and applied, in the form of mutual or
monitorial instruction, and was hailed as "a new expedient, parallel and
rival to the modern inventions in the mechanical departments."

[Illustration: FIG. 185. THE CREATORS OF THE MONITORIAL SYSTEM
REV. ANDREW BELL (1753-1832)
JOSEPH LANCASTER (1778-1838)]

ORIGIN OF MUTUAL OR MONITORIAL INSTRUCTION. In 1797 Dr. Andrew Bell, a
clergyman in the Established Church, published the results of his
experiment in the use of monitors in India. [17] The idea attracted
attention, and the plan was successfully introduced into a number of
charity-schools. About the same time (1798) a young Quaker schoolmaster,
Joseph Lancaster by name, was led independently to a similar discovery of
the advantages of using monitors, by reason of his needing assistance in
his school and being too poor to pay for additional teachers. In 1803 he
published an account of his plan. [18] The two plans were quite similar,
attracted attention from the first, and schools formed after one or the
other of the plans were soon organized all over England.

Increased attention was attracted to the new plans by a bitter church
quarrel which broke out as to who was the real originator of the idea,
[19] Bell being upheld by Church-of-England supporters, and Lancaster by
the Dissenters. In 1808 "The Royal Lancastrian Institution" was formed,
which in 1814 became "The British and Foreign School Society," to promote
Lancastrian schools. This society had the close support of King George
III, the Whigs, and the _Edinburgh Review_, while such liberals as
Brougham, Whitbread, and James Mill were on its board of directors. This
Society sent out Lancaster to expound his "truly British" system, and by
1810 as many as ninety-five Lancastrian schools had been established in
England. His model school in Borough Road, Southwark, which became a
training-school for teachers, is shown on the following page. Lancaster
was a poor manager; became involved in financial difficulties; and in 1818
left for the United States, where he spent the remainder of his life in
organizing such schools and expounding his system. For a time this
attracted wide attention, as we shall point out in the following chapter.

Lancaster's work stimulated the Church of England into activity, and in
1811 "The National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the
Principles of the Established Church throughout England and Wales" was
formed by prominent S.P.C.K. (p. 449) members and Churchmen, with the
Archbishop of Canterbury as president. This Society was supported by the
Tories, the Established Church, and the _Quarterly Review_, and was formed
to promote the Bell system, [20] "which made religious instruction an
essential and necessary part of the plan." Within a month £15,000 had been
subscribed to establish schools. Among many other contributions were £500
each from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. A training-school for
teachers was organized; district societies were formed over England to
establish schools; and a system of organized aid was extended for both
buildings and maintenance. By 1831 there were 900,412 children receiving
instruction in the monitorial schools of the National Society alone.

[Illustration: Fig. 186. THE LANCASTRIAN MODEL SCHOOL IN BOROUGH ROAD,
SOUTHWARK, LONDON
This shows 365 pupils, seated for writing.  The room was 40 x 90 feet in
size and contained 20 desks, each 25 feet long. The boys of each row were
divided into two "drafts" of from eight to ten, each in charge of a
monitor. Around the wall were 31 "stations," indicated by the semicircles
on the floor.]

The mutual-instruction idea spread to other lands--France, Belgium,
Holland, Denmark--and seems to have been tried even in German lands. In
France and Belgium it was experimented with for a time because of its
cheapness, but was soon discarded because of its defects. In Teutonic
lands, where the much better Pestalozzian ideas had become established,
the monitorial system made practically no headway. It was in the United
States, of all countries outside of England, that the idea met with most
ready acceptance.

[Illustration: FIG. 187. MONITORS TEACHING READING AT "STATIONS"
Three "drafts" of ten each, with their toes to the semicircles painted on

THE SYSTEM OF MUTUAL OR MONITORIAL INSTRUCTION. The great merit, aside
from being cheap, of the mutual or monitorial system of instruction lay in
that it represented a marked advance in school organization over the older
individual method of instruction, with its accompanying waste of time and
schoolroom disorder. Under the individual method only a small number of
pupils could be placed under the control of one teacher, and the expense
for such instruction made general education almost prohibitive.
Pestalozzi, to be sure, had worked out in Switzerland the modern class-
system of instruction, and following developmental lines in teaching, but
of this the English were not only ignorant, but it called for a degree of
pedagogical skill which their teachers did not then possess. Bell and
Lancaster now evolved a plan whereby one teacher, assisted by a number of
the brighter pupils whom they designated as monitors, could teach from two
hundred to a thousand pupils in one school (R. 297). The picture of
Lancaster's London school (Figure 186) shows 365 pupils seated. [21] The
pupils were sorted into rows, and to each row was assigned a clever boy
(monitor) to act as an assistant teacher. A common number for each monitor
to look after was ten. The teacher first taught these monitors a lesson
from a printed card, and then each monitor took his row to a "station"
about the wall and proceeded to teach the other boys what he had just
learned. At first used only for teaching reading and the Catechism, the
plan was soon extended to the teaching of writing, arithmetic, and
spelling, and later on to instruction in higher branches. The system was
very popular from about 1810 to 1830, but by 1840 its popularity had
waned.

[Illustration: FIG. 188. PROPER MONITORIAL-SCHOOL POSITIONS
(From an engraved plate of 30 positions, in a Manual of the British and
Foreign School Society, London, 1831)]

Such schools were naturally highly organized, the organization being
largely mechanical (R. 298). Lancaster, in particular, was an organizing
genius. The _Manuals of Instruction_ gave complete directions for the
organization and management of monitorial schools, the details of
recitation work, use of apparatus, order, position of pupils at their
work, and classification being minutely laid down. By carefully studying
and following these directions any reasonably intelligent person could
soon learn to become a successful teacher in a monitorial school.

The schools, mechanical as they now seem, marked a great improvement over
the individual method upon which schoolmasters for centuries had wasted so
much of their own and their pupils' time. In place of earlier idleness,
inattention, and disorder, Bell and Lancaster introduced activity,
emulation, order, and a kind of military discipline which was of much
value to the type of children attending these schools. Lancaster's
biographer, Salmon, has written of the system that so thoroughly was the
instruction worked out that the teacher had only to organize, oversee,
reward, punish, and inspire:

When a child was admitted a monitor assigned him his class; while he
remained, a monitor taught him (with nine other pupils); when he was
absent, one monitor ascertained the fact, and another found out the
reason; a monitor examined him periodically, and, when he made progress, a
monitor promoted him; a monitor ruled the writing paper; a monitor had
charge of slates and books; and a monitor-general looked after all the
other monitors. Every monitor wore a leather ticket, gilded and lettered,
"Monitor of the First Class," "Reading Monitor of the Second Class," etc.

VALUE OF THE SYSTEM IN AWAKENING INTEREST. The monitorial system of
instruction, coming at the time it did, exerted a very important influence
in awakening interest in and a sentiment for schools. It increased the
number of people who possessed the elements of an education; made schools
much more talked about; and aroused thought and provoked discussion on the
question of education. It did much toward making people see the advantages
of a certain amount of schooling, and be willing to contribute to its
support. Under the plans previously in use education had been a slow and
an expensive process, because it had to be carried on by the individual
method of instruction, and in quite small groups. Under this new plan it
was now possible for one teacher to instruct 300, 400, 500, or more pupils
in a single room, and to do it with much better results in both learning
and discipline than the old type of schoolmaster had achieved.

All at once, comparatively, a new system had been introduced which not
only improved and popularized, but tremendously cheapened education. [22]
Lancaster, in his _Improvements in Education_, gave the annual cost of
schooling under his system as only seven shillings sixpence ($1.80) per
pupil, and this was later decreased to four shillings fivepence ($1.06) as
the school was increased to accommodate a thousand pupils. Under the Bell
system the yearly cost per pupil, in a school of five hundred, was only
four shillings twopence ($1.00), in 1814. In the United States,
Lancastrian schools cost from $1.22 per pupil in New York, in 1822, up to
$3.00 and $4.00 later on. At first begun as free schools, [23] the
expansion of effort was more rapid than the income from contributions, and
a small tuition fee was in time charged. Pupils were admitted at about the
age of seven, and might remain until thirteen or fourteen, though an
attendance of two years was considered "abundantly sufficient for any
boy." To prepare skilled masters and mistresses for the schools, girls
were provided for in many places--training or model schools were organized
by both the national societies, and these represent the beginnings of
normal-school training in England.

INFANT SCHOOLS. Another type of school which became of much importance in
England, and spread to other lands, was the Infant School. This owed its
origin to Robert Owen, proprietor of the cotton mills at New Lanark,
Scotland. Being of a philanthropic turn of mind, and believing that man
was entirely the product of circumstance and environment, he held that it
was not possible to begin too early in implanting right habits and forming
character. Poverty and crime, he believed, were results of errors in the
various systems of education and government. So plastic was child nature,
that society would be able to mould itself "into the very image of
rational wishes and desires." That "the infants of any one class in the
world may be readily formed into men of any other class," was a
fundamental belief of his.

[Illustration: FIG. 189 ROBERT OWEN (1771-1858)]

When he took charge of the mills at New Lanark (1799) he found the usual
wretched social conditions of the time. Children of five, six, and seven
years were bound out to the factory as apprentices (R. 242) for a period
of nine years. They worked as apprentices and helpers in the factories
twelve to thirteen hours a day, and at early manhood were turned free to
join the ignorant mass of the population. Owen sought to remedy this
condition. He accordingly opened schools which children might enter at
three years of age, receiving them into the schools almost as soon as they
were able to walk, and caring for them while their parents were at work.
Children under ten he forbade to work in the mills, and for these he
provided schools. The instruction for the children younger than six was to
be "whatever might be supposed useful that they could understand," and
much was made of singing, dancing, and play. Moral instruction was made a
prominent feature. By 1814 his work and his schools had become famous. In
1817 he published a plan for the organization of such industrial
communities as he conducted. In 1818 he visited Switzerland, and saw
Pestalozzi and Fellenberg.

In 1818 a number of Liberals--Brougham, James Mill, and others--combined
to establish an Infant School in London, importing a teacher from New
Lanark. The idea took root, was popularized, and the Infant School was
soon adopted as an integral part of their schools by both the British and
Foreign School Society (Lancastrians) and the National Society (Bell). In
1836 the "Home and Colonial Infant School Society" was formed to train
teachers for and to establish Infant Schools. One of the organizers of
this society was Charles Mayo who had worked with Pestalozzi at Yverdon
(R. 270), and through his influence much of the bookishness which had
crept in was removed and the better Pestalozzian procedure put in its
place.

Unlike the monitorial schools, the Infant Schools were based on the idea
of small-group work, and were usually conducted in harmony with the new
psychological conceptions of instruction which had been worked out by
Pestalozzi, and had by that time begun to be introduced into England. The
Infant-School idea came at an opportune time, as the defects of the
mechanical Lancastrian instruction were becoming evident and its
popularity was waning. It gave a new and a somewhat deeper philosophical
interpretation of the educational process, created a stronger demand than
had before been known for trained teachers, established a preference for
women teachers for primary work, and tended to give a new dignity to
teaching and school work by revealing something of a psychological basis
for the instruction of little children. It also contributed its share
toward awakening a sentiment for national action.

WORK OF THE EDUCATIONAL SOCIETIES. The work of the voluntary and
philanthropic educational societies in establishing schools and providing
teachers and instruction before the days of national schools was enormous.
[24] Though the State did nothing before 1833, and little before 1870, the
work of the educational societies was large and important. What was done
by the church societies alone may be seen from the following table:

After about 1820-25 the rising interest in elementary education expressed
itself in the formation of a number of additional societies, the more
important of which were:

    1824. "London Infant School Society" founded by Brougham.
    1826. "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge" founded by
          Brougham. The _Journal of Education_ begun.
    1836. "Central Society of Education" founded.
    1836. "Home and Colonial Infant Society" founded. Beginning of a
          Pestalozzian Training College.
    1837. "Educational Committee of the Wesleyan Conference" established.
    1843. "Congregational Board of Education" formed.
    1844. "Ragged School Union" founded.
    1845. "Catholic Institute."
    1847. The "Catholic Poor-School Committee."
    1847. "Lancashire Public School Association" formed.
    1850. The "National Public School Association."
    1867. "Birmingham Education Aid Society."
    1868. The Manchester Conference.
    1869. Formation of "The League."

Some of these were formed to found and support schools, and some engaged
primarily in the work of propaganda in an effort to secure some national
action.


III. THE STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL EDUCATION

THE PARLIAMENTARY STRUGGLE. During the whole of the eighteenth century
Parliament had enacted no legislation relating to elementary education,
aside from the one Act of 1767 for the education of pauper children in
London, and the freeing of elementary schools, Dissenters, and Catholics,
from inhibitions as to teaching. In the nineteenth century this attitude
was to be changed, though slowly, and after three quarters of a century of
struggle the beginnings of national education were finally to be made for
England, as they had by then for every other great nation. In 1870 the
"no-business-of-the-State" attitude toward the education of the people,
which had persisted from the days of the great Elizabeth, was finally and
permanently changed. The legislative battle began with the first Factory
Act [25] of 1802, Whitbread's Parochial Schools Bill [26] of 1807, and
Brougham's first Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry of 1816 (R. 291); it
finally culminated with the reform of the old endowed Grammar Schools by
the Act of 1869, the enactment of the Elementary Education Act of 1870 (R.
304), and the Act of 1871 freeing instruction in the universities from
religious restrictions (R. 305). The first of these enactments declared
clearly the right of the State to inquire into, reorganize, and redirect
the age-old educational foundations for secondary education; the second
made the definite though tardy beginnings of a national system of
elementary education for England; and the third opened up a university
career to the whole nation. The agitation and conflict of ideas was long
drawn out, and need not be traced in detail. The following tabulated
summary will give the main outlines of the struggle, and the selection on
"The Educational Traditions of England" (R. 306) gives a good brief
history of the long conflict.

And is God's guerdon less than they?
Nay, moral man, I tell thee Nay:

And by that rood where He was bent I saw the world's great captains all
Go riding to the tournament-- Cyrus the Great and Hannibal, Caesar

Bend o'er thy book till thou be grey, Read, mark, perpend, digest, survey--
Instruct thee deep as Solomon-- One only chapter thou shalt con, One

High Virtue's hest is eloquent With spur and not with martingall:
Sufficeth not thou'rt continent:
BE COURTEOUS, BRAVE, AND LIBERAL.
God fashion'd thee of chosen clay For service, nor did ever say
"Deny thee this," "Abstain from yon," Save to inure thee, thew and

_Virtue is that beseems a Man!

    A friend to whom I showed these verses remarked that Mr. Blank was
    indeed a person who fed his soul upon negatives; but that I possibly
    did him some injustice in charging so much of this to timidity,
    whereas the scent lay rather in the gusto with which he judged his
    fellow-men.
    
    "And, by the way," said he, "is there not some gusto in the scorn
    with which you are judging Mr.

Blank at this moment?"

"Do you remember," I answered, "how that man, after voting
for war the other day, went straight off to a meeting of the Peace
Society and put up a florid appeal to the Prince of Peace for a
time when wars should be no more?

Let him be, however: I do wrong to lose my temper with him. But on this
matter of national timidity I have something to say. . . ."
I have been reading John Holland's two _Discourses of the Navy_, written
in 1638 and 1659, and published the other day by the Navy Records
Society.
The object of Mr. Holland's discourses was to reform the Navy, purge it of
abuses, and strengthen it for the defence of this realm; and I
have been curious to compare his methods with those of our own Navy
League, which has been making such a noise for ten years or so. The
first thing I observe is the attitude of mind in which he
approaches his subject:--
"If either the honour of a nation, commerce or trust with all nations,
peace at home, grounded upon our enemies' fear or love of us abroad,
and attended with plenty of all things necessary either for the preservation
of the public weal or thy private welfare, be things worthy thy esteem
(though it may be beyond thy shoal conceit) then next to God and thy
King give thy thanks for the same to the Navy.
As for honour, who knows not (that knows anything) that in all records of
late times of actions, chronicled to the everlasting fame and renown of
this nation, still the naval part is the thread that runs through the whole
wooft, the burden of the song, the scope of the text? . . ."
He proceeds to enumerate some particular commercial advantages due to our
mastery of the sea, and sums up in these words:--
"Suffice it thus far, nothing under God, who doth all, hath brought
so much, so great commerce to this Kingdom as the rightly noble
employments of our navy; a wheel, if truly turned, that sets to
work all Christendom by its motion; a mill, if well extended, that in a
sweet yet sovereign composure contracts the grist of all nations to its
own dominions, and requires only the tribute of its own people, not
for, but towards, its maintenance."

The eloquence may be turgid, but the attitude is dignified. The man
does not scold; does not terrify. He lays his stress on the benefits of
a strong navy--on the renown it has won for England in the past. He assumes
his readers to be intelligent men, amenable to advice which will help them
to perpetuate this renown and secure these benefits in time to come.
His exordium over, he settles down to an exposition of the abuses which are
impairing our naval efficiency, and suggests reforms, some wisely conceived,
others not so wisely, with the business-like, confident air of one who knows
what he is talking about.

Now I open the prospectus in which our Navy League started out to make
everyone's flesh creep, and come plump upon language of this sort:--
"It is the close, let us suppose, of our second month of war.
The fleet has been neglected, and has been overwhelmed, unready and
unprepared. We have been beaten twice at sea, and our enemies have
established no accidental superiority, but a permanent and overwhelming
one. The telegraph cables have been severed, one and all; these islands
are in darkness."--
For presumably the gas-mains, as well as the cables, have been 'severed'
(imposing word!)--
--"Under a heavy cloud of woe.

Invasion is in the air, our armies are mustering in the south. We are
cut off from the world, and can only fitfully perceive what is happening.
Our liners have been captured or sunk on the high seas; our ocean tramps
are in our enemies' hands; British trade is dead, killed by the wholesale
ravages of the hostile cruisers. Our ports are insulted or held up to
ransom, when news reaches us from India it is to the effect that the
enemy is before our troops, a native insurrection behind.
Malta has fallen, and our outlying positions are passing from our hands.
Food is contraband, and may not be imported. Amid the jeers of Europe
'the nation of shopkeepers' is writhing in its death agony."
Pretty, is it not? But let us have just a little more.

"COMMERCIAL COLLAPSE.

"And what of the internal, of the social position? Consols have fallen to
nearly 30; our vast investments in India have been lost; trade no
longer exists. . . . The railways have no traffic to carry.
. . . Banks and companies are failing daily. . . The East End of London
is clamouring for bread and peace at any price. If we fall, we fall for
ever. . . . The working man has to choose whether he will have lighter
taxation for the moment, starvation and irretrievable ruin for the future
. . ."
--And so on, till Z stands for Zero, or nothing at all. Or, as the
late Mr.

Lear preferred to write:--
"Z said, 'Here is a box of Zinc, Get in, my little master!
We'll shut you up; we'll nail you down: we will, my little master!
We think we've all heard quite enough of this your sad disaster!'"
To speak as seriously as may be, the language is no longer hortatory,
like Holland's, but minatory, even comminatory.

It is (as its author would not deny) the language of panic deliberately
employed, a calculated attempt to strengthen the _materiel_ of the
navy at the cost of Englishmen's fears.

Now let me define my feeling towards the Navy League. As an ordinary British
citizen, I must heartily approve its aim of strengthening the navy and
keeping it efficient. As an ordinary reasonable man, I must admit that
its efforts, if rightly directed, may be of great national service.
But language such as I have quoted must (so far as it is not merely
contemptible) be merely demoralising, and anyone who works on the fears
of a nation--and especially of a nation which declines conscription and
its one undoubted advantage of teaching men what war means--does a harm
which is none the less wicked for being incalculable. These Navy Leaguers
cry incessantly for more _material_ strength. They tell us that in
material strength we should at least be equal to any two other countries.

A few months pass, and then, their appetite growing with the terror it
feeds upon, they insist that we must be equal to any three other
countries. Also "it does not appear," they sagely remark, "that Nelson
and his contemporaries left any record as to what the proportion of the
blockading should bear (_sic_) to one blockaded,"--a curious
omission of Nelson's, to be sure!

    He may perhaps have held that it depended on the quality of the
antagonists.

    To this a few ordinary stupid Britons like myself have always
answered that no amount of _materiel_ can ever replace _morale_;
and that all such panic-making is a mischievous attempt to lower
the breed, and the more mischievous because its mischief may for a
while be imperceptible.

We can see our warships growing: we cannot see the stamina decaying;
yet it is our stamina on which we must rely finally in the fatal hour
of trial. We said this, and we were laughed at; insulted as unpatriotic--a
word of which one may say in kindness that it would not so readily
leap to the lips of professional patriots if they were able to
understand what it means and, by consequence, how much it hurts.

Yes, and behold, along comes Admiral Togo, and at one stroke proves
that we were simply, absolutely and henceforward incontestably
right!
What were our little three-power experts doing on the morrow of
Togo's victory?

They are making irrelevant noises in the halfpenny press, explaining how
Admiral Togo did it with an inferior force, and in a fashion that belies
all their axioms. But I turn to _The Times_ and I read:--
"The event shows that mere material equality is but as dust in the
balance when weighed in the day of battle against superiority of moral
equipment."
--Which, when you come to think of it, is precisely what Bacon meant when
he wrote:--
"Walled Townes, stored Arcenalls and Armouries, Goodly Races of Horse,
Chariots of Warre, Elephants, Ordnance, Artillery and the like: all this
is but a Sheep in a Lion's skin except the Breed and disposition of the
People be stout and warlike. Nay, Number (it selfe) in Armies importeth
not much where the People is of weake Courage: For (as _Virgil_ saith)
_it never troubles a Wolfe how many the Sheepe be_."

    Do our friends of the Navy League seriously believe that a principle
    as old as humankind can be suddenly upset by the invention of a submarine
    or of some novelty in guns? Even in their notions of what
    material strength means I hold them to be mistaken. The last resource
    which a nation ought to neglect is its financial credit. It was
    Walpole's long policy of peace which made possible Pitt's conquests.

But I hold with far stronger conviction that he does wickedly who trades
on a nation's cowardice to raise money for its protection. An old text,
my masters! It seems a long while that some of us were preaching it in
vain until Admiral Togo came along and proved it.

I observe that a Member of Parliament for a West of England
constituency (a better fellow than Mr.

Blank, too) has been using one of the arguments with which these precious
experts attacked me; that because I sometimes write novels I
cannot be supposed to think seriously on public affairs.
My only wonder is that those who hold this cloistral view of the
province of a man of letters consider him worthy to pay income-tax.

I pass over some tempting reflections on the queer anomaly that this
prohibition should be addressed (as it so often is) by writers to writers,
by newspaper writers to men who write books, and (so far as a distinction
can be drawn) by men who write in a hurry to men who write deliberately.

I wish to look quietly into the belief on which it rests and to
inquire how that belief was come by.

There certainly was a time when such a belief would have been laughed
at as scarcely reasonable enough to be worth discussing. And that time,
oddly enough, was almost conterminous with the greatest era of the
world's literature, the greatest era of political discovery, and the
greatest era of Empire-making. The men who made Athens and the men who made
Rome would have disputed (I fear somewhat contemptuously) the axiom on
which my friend the West Country member builds his case.
They held it for axiomatic that the artist and man of letters ought not
to work in cloistral isolation, removed from public affairs, and indifferent
to them; that on the contrary they are direct servants of their
State, and have a peculiar call to express themselves on matters of
public moment. To convince you that I am not advancing any pet theory
of my own let me present it in the words of a grave and judicious student,
Mr. W. J.

    Courthope, late Professor of Poetry at Oxford:--
    "The idea of the State lay at the root of every Greek conception
    of art and morals. For though, in the view of the philosopher, the
    virtue of the good citizen was not always necessarily identical with
    the virtue of the individual man, and though, in the city of Athens
    at all events, a large amount of life was possible to the individual
    apart from public interests, yet it is none the less true that
    the life of the individual in every Greek city was in reality moulded
    by the customary life, tradition and character, in one intranslatable
    word, by the _ethos_ of the State. Out of this native soil grew that
    recognised, though not necessarily public, system of education
    (_politike paideia_ ), consisting of reading and writing, music
    and gymnastic, which Plato and Aristotle themselves accepted as the
    basis of the constitution of the State.

But this preliminary education was only the threshold to a subsequent
system of
political training, of which, in Athens at least, every citizen had an
opportunity of availing himself by his right to participate in
public affairs; so that, in the view of Pericles, politics themselves were
an instrument of individual refinement. 'The magistrates,' said he, in his
great funeral oration, 'who discharge public trusts, fulfil their
domestic duties also; the private citizen, while engaged in
professional business, has competent knowledge of public affairs;
for we stand alone in regarding the man who keeps aloof from these
latter not as harmless, but as useless.

Moreover, we always hear and pronounce on public matters when discussed
by our leaders, or perhaps strike out for ourselves correct reasonings
upon them; far from accounting discussion an impediment to action, we
complain only if we are not told what is to be done before it becomes our
duty to do it.'
"The strenuous exertion of the faculties of the individual in the service
of the State, described in these eloquent words, reflects itself in the
highest productions of Greek art and literature, and is the source of that
'political' spirit which every one can detect, alike in the poems of
Homer and the sculpture of the Parthenon, as the inspiring cause of the
noblest efforts of imitation.
It prevailed most strongly through the period between the battle of
Marathon and the battle of Chaeronea, and has left its monuments in such
plays as the _Persae_ and _Eumeuides_ of AEschylus, the _Antigone_ of
Sophocles, the _Clouds_ of Aristophanes, the History of Thucydides
and the Orations of Demosthenes, its last embodiment being perhaps the
famous oath of that orator on the souls of those who risked their
lives at Marathon."

--_History of English Poetry_, vol. i., c 2.

In the most brilliant age of Greece, then, and of Greek art and letters,
the civic spirit was the inspiring spirit. But as the Greek cities sank one
by one before the Macedonian power and forfeited their liberties, this
civic spirit died for lack of nourishment and exercise, and literature was
driven to feed on itself--which is about the worst thing that can ever
happen to it, and one of the worst things that can happen to a
nation.
The old political education gave place to an 'encyclopaedic' education.
The language fell into the hands of grammarians and teachers of rhetoric,
whose inventions may have a certain interest of their own, but--to
quote Mr. Courthope again--no longer reflect the feelings and
energies of free political life. Roman literature drives home the
same, or a similar, moral. "The greatness of Rome was as entirely
civic in its origin as that of any Greek city, and, like the Greek
cities, Rome in the days of her freedom, and while she was still
fighting for the mastery, preserved a system of political education,
both in the hearth and the Senate, which was suited to her character.Of these, 8000 had only Church-of-England Voluntary
Schools.

In 1880 elementary education had been made fully compulsory, and in 1891
largely free. In 1893 the age for exemption from attendance was fixed at
eleven, and in 1899 this was raised to twelve. In 1888 county and borough
councils had been created, better to enforce the Act and to extend
supervision. The _Annual Codes_, from 1870 to 1902, gradually extended
governmental control through more and more detailed instructions as to
inspection, the addition of new subjects, and better compulsion to attend.
In 1899 a Central Board of Education, under a President and a
Parliamentary Secretary, was created, to consolidate in one body the work
formerly done by:

    a. The Committee of Council on Education (established 1839), which
       administered the grants for elementary education.

    b. The Department of Science and Art (established 1853), which
       administered the grants for special and evening instruction in
       science and art.

    c. The Charity Commissioners, to which had been given (1874)
       supervision of the old educational trusts and endowments for
       education.

    d. The educational functions of the Board of Agriculture.

This new Board unified the administration of elementary and secondary
education for the first time in English history.

By about 1895 the strain on the Voluntary Schools had become hard to bear.
The Church resented the encroachments of the State on its ancient
privilege of training the young, and the larger resources which the Board
Schools could command. In 1895 the Conservative party won the
parliamentary elections, and remained in power for some years. This was
the opportunity of the Voluntary Schools, and in 1897 a special national-
aid grant of five shillings per pupil in average daily attendance was made
to the Voluntary Schools. This simply increased the general
dissatisfaction, and there was soon a general demand for new legislation
that would reconcile the whole question of national education. The Law of
1902 was the ultimate result.

THE ANNEXATION LAW OF 1902. The Balfour Education Act of 1902 marks the
beginning of a new period in English education. For the first time in
English history education of all grades--elementary, secondary, and
higher; voluntary and state--was brought under the control of one single
local authority, and Voluntary Schools were taken over and made a charge
on the "rates" equally with the Board Schools. New local Educational
Committees and Councils replaced the old School Boards, and all secular
instruction in state-aided schools of all types was now placed under their
control. Religious instruction could continue where desired. In addition,
one third of the property of England, which had heretofore escaped all
direct taxation for education, was now compelled to pay its proper share.
The foundation principle that "the wealth of the. State must educate the
children of the State" was now applied, for the first time.

The State now abandoned the old policy of merely supervising and assisting
voluntary associations to maintain schools, in competition with state-
provided schools, and assumed the whole responsibility for the secular
instruction of the people. Though the law awakened intense opposition from
those who felt that it "riveted the hand of the cleric on the schools of
the land," it nevertheless equalized and unified educational provisions;
paved the way for much future progress; made the general provision of
secondary education possible; and represented an important new step in the
process of creating a national system of education for the people. Under
this Law much has been done by the new Central Board of Education, and
subsequent supplementary legislation, to increase materially the
efficiency of the education provided.

Since 1902 the cost for education per pupil has been increased more than
one half. The local authorities, to whom were given large powers of
control, have levied taxes liberally, and the State has also increased its
grants. Since 1902 also there has been a continual agitation for a
resettlement of the educational question along broad national lines. Bills
have been introduced, and important committees have considered the matter,
but no affirmative action was taken. By the time of the opening of the
World War it may be said that English opinion had about agreed upon the
principle of public control of all schools, absolute religious freedom for
teachers, local option as to religious instruction, large local liberty in
management and control, well-trained and well-paid teachers, and the
fusing of all types of schools into a democratic and truly national school
system, strong in its unity and national elements, but free from
centralized bureaucratic control. It was left for the World War to give
emphasis to this national need and to permit the final creation of such an
educational organization.

THE INCORPORATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION INTO THE NATIONAL SYSTEM. For
centuries the education of the small ruling class has been conducted by
the private tutor and the endowed secondary school, and had been completed
by a few years at Oxford or Cambridge. The Reform Bill of 1832 had raised
the middle commercial and industrial classes to power, and had created new
demands for secondary and higher education for the sons of this class. The
old endowed schools were now no longer sufficient in numbers, and the
result was the founding of many private and joint-stock-company secondary
schools to minister to the new educational needs. The Second Reform Bill
of 1867 enfranchised a very much greater number of citizens, and the
increasing wealth and the increasing demands for educational advantages
led to an insistence for a further extension along secondary and higher
lines. The result was seen in the investigation of the nine "Great Public
Schools" of England, [34] by the Lord Clarendon Commission (1861-64); and
the appointment of the British Schools Inquiry Commission of 1864-67, to
inquire into the 820 other endowed schools and the 122 proprietary or
joint-stock-company schools of the land. The Report of the first led to
the Public Schools Act of 1868, reforming abuses and regulating the use of
their old endowments. The second pointed out the great deficiency then
existing in secondary education, [35] and led to the enactment of the
Endowed Schools Act of 1869, placing all endowed schools under centralized
supervision. We see here the beginnings of state supervision and control
of the age-old endowments for Latin grammar schools and other types of
schools for secondary training. The repeal of the old Religious-Tests-for-
Degrees legislation, at the old universities (R. 305), in 1871,
transformed these from Church-of-England into national institutions, and
opened up the whole range of education to all who could meet the standards
and pay the fees.

Under the Act of 1870 many local school boards, especially in the
manufacturing cities, began to satisfy the new needs by the organization
of Higher Grade Schools, or High Schools, to supplement the work of the
elementary schools and to extend upward, in a truly democratic fashion,
the educational ladder. In this movement the manufacturing cities of
Sheffield, Birmingham, and Manchester were the leaders. In these three
cities also, as well as in four others (Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, and
London) [36] new modern-type universities were created. The Department of
Science and Art (created in 1853) also began, in 1872, to give large
grants to the cities for the establishment of a three-years' course in
science, for the encouragement of scientific training. These new
secondary-type schools, providing for the direct passage of children from
the elementary to the secondary schools, with many free places for capable
students, served to increase the friction between rate-aided schools on
the one hand, and voluntary and endowed and proprietary schools on the
other. Carrying out, as they did, Huxley's idea of a broad educational
ladder, [37] they also represented a very democratic innovation in English
educational procedure.

In 1894 a Commission--a favorite English method for considering vexatious
questions--was appointed, under the chairmanship of Mr. James (afterwards
Lord) Bryce, "to consider the best methods of establishing a well-
organized system of secondary education in England." The Report was
important and influential. It recommended the creation of a general Board
of Education under a responsible government Minister, with a permanent
Secretary and a Consultative Educational Council (as was done in 1899);
the establishment of local county and borough boards to provide adequate
secondary-school accommodations, with aid from the "rates"; the inspection
of secondary schools by the Central Board of Education; the professional
training of secondary-school teachers; and a great extension of the free-
scholarship plan to children from the elementary schools. On this last
point the Report said: [38]

    We have to consider the means whereby the children of the less well-
    to-do classes of our population may be enabled to obtain such
    secondary education as may be suitable and needful for them. As we
    have not recommended that secondary education shall be provided free
    of cost to the whole community, we deem it all the more needful that
    ample provision be made by every local authority for enabling selected
    children of poorer parents to climb the educational ladder.... The
    assistance we have contemplated should be given by means of a
    carefully graduated system of scholarships, varying in value in the
    age at which they are awarded and the class of school or institution
    at which they are tenable.

The Act of 1902 unified control of both elementary and secondary
education. Any private or endowed secondary school was left free to accept
or reject government aid and inspection, but, if the aid were accepted,
inspection and the following of government plans were required. Secondary
education must provide for scholars up to or beyond the age of sixteen. No
attempt was made to unify the work and character of the secondary schools,
it being clearly recognized that, in England at least, these must be
suited to the different requirements of the scholars, the means of the
parents, the age at which schooling will stop, and the probable place in
the social organism of England which the pupils will occupy. By 1910, out
of 841 secondary schools in England receiving grants of state aid, 325
were supported by local authorities and were the creations of the
preceding four decades. Most of the others represented old Latin grammar-
school foundations, thus incorporated into the national system, and
without that violence and destruction of endowments which characterized
the transformations in France and Italy.

[Illustration: FIG. 195. THE ENGLISH EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS FINALLY EVOLVED
The years, for the divisions of English education, are only approximate,
as English education is more flexible than that found in most other
lands.]

A NATIONAL SYSTEM AT LAST EVOLVED. It is a little more than two centuries
from the founding of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge
(1699) to the very important Fisher Education Act [39] of August, 1918.
The first marked the beginnings of the voluntary system; the second "the
first real attempt in England to lay broad and deep the foundations of a
scheme of education which would be truly national." This Act, passed by
Parliament in the midst of a war which called upon the English people for
heavy sacrifices, completed the evolution of two centuries and organized
the educational resources--elementary, secondary, evening, adult,
technical, and higher--into one national system, animated by a national
purpose, and aimed at the accomplishment for the nation of twentieth-
century ends on the most democratic basis of any school system in Europe.
In so doing Huxley's educational ladder has not only been changed into a
broad highway, but the educational traditions of England (R. 306) have
been preserved and moulded anew.

The central national supervisory authority has been still further
strengthened; the compulsion to attend greatly extended; and the voice of
the State has been uttered in a firmer tone than ever before in English
educational history. Taxes have been increased; the scope of the school
system extended; all elements of the system better integrated; laggard
local educational authorities subjected to firmer control; the training of
teachers looked after more carefully than ever before; and the foundations
for unlimited improvement and progress in education laid down. Still, in
doing all this, the deep English devotion to local liberties has been
clearly revealed. The dangers of a centralized French-type educational
bureaucracy have been avoided; necessary, and relatively high, minimum
standards have been set up, but without sacrificing that variety which has
always been one of the strong points of English educational effort; and
the legitimate claims of the State have been satisfied without destroying
local initiative and independence. In this story of two centuries and more
of struggle to create a really national system of education for the people
we see strongly revealed those prominent characteristics of English
national progress--careful consideration of new ideas, keen sensitiveness
to vested rights, strong sense of local liberties and responsibilities,
large dependence on local effort and good sense, progress by compromise,
and a slow grafting-on of the best elements of what is new without
sacrificing the best elements of what is old.

AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE UNITED STATES


I. EARLY NATIONAL ATTITUDES AND INTERESTS

THE AMERICAN PROBLEM. The beginnings of state educational organization in
the United States present quite a different history from that traced for
Prussia, France, Italy, or England. While the parochial school existed in
the Central Colonies, and in time had to be subordinated to state ends;
and while the idea of education as a charity had been introduced into all
the Anglican Colonies, and later had to be stamped out; the problem of
educational organization in America was not, as in Europe, one of bringing
church schools and old educational foundations into harmonious working
relations with the new state school systems set up. Instead the old
educational foundations were easily transformed to adapt them to the new
conditions, while only in the Central Colonies did the religious-charity
conception of education give any particular trouble. The American
educational problem was essentially that of first awakening, in a new
land, a consciousness of need for general education; and second, that of
developing a willingness to pay for what it finally came to be deemed
desirable to provide.

By the middle of the eighteenth century, as we have pointed out (p. 438),
the earlier religious interests in America had clearly begun to wane. In
the New England Colonies the school of the civil town had largely replaced
the earlier religious school. In the Middle Colonies many of the parochial
schools had died out. In the Southern Colonies, where the classes in
society and negro slavery made common schools impossible, and the lack of
city life and manufacturing made them seem largely unnecessary, the common
school had tended to disappear. Even in New England, where the Calvinistic
conception of the importance of education had most firmly established the
idea of school support, the eighteenth century witnessed a constant
struggle to prevent the dying-out of that which an earlier generation had
deemed it important to create.

EFFECT OF THE WAR ON EDUCATION. The effect of the American War for
Independence, on all types of schools, was disastrous. The growing
troubles with the mother country had, for more than a decade previous to
the opening of hostilities, tended to concentrate attention on other
matters than schooling. Political discussion and agitation had largely
monopolized the thinking of the time.

With the outbreak of the war education everywhere suffered seriously. Most
of the rural and parochial schools closed, or continued a more or less
intermittent existence. In New York City, then the second largest city in
the country, practically all schools closed with British occupancy and
remained closed until after the end of the war. The Latin grammar schools
and academies often closed from lack of pupils, while the colleges were
almost deserted. Harvard and Kings, in particular, suffered grievously,
and sacrificed much for the cause of liberty. The war engrossed the
energies and the resources of the peoples of the different Colonies, and
schools, never very securely placed in the affections of the people,
outside of New England, were allowed to fall into decay or entirely
disappear. The period of the Revolution and the period of reorganization
which followed, up to the beginning of the national government (1775-89),
were together a time of rapid decline in educational advantages and
increasing illiteracy among the people. Meager as had been the
opportunities for schooling before 1775, the opportunities by 1790, except
in a few cities and in the New England districts, had shrunk almost to the
vanishing point. For Boston (R. 307), Providence (Rs. 309, 310), and a
number of other places we have good pictures preserved of the schools
which actually did exist.

The close of the war found the country both impoverished and exhausted.
All the Colonies had made heavy sacrifices, many had been overrun by
hostile armies, and the debt of the Union and of the States was so great
that many thought it could never be paid. The thirteen States,
individually and collectively, with only 3,380,000 people, had incurred an
indebtedness of $75,000,000 for the prosecution of the conflict. Commerce
was dead, the Government of the Confederation was impotent, petty
insurrections were common, the States were quarreling continually with one
another over all kinds of trivial matters, England still remained more or
less hostile, and foreign complications began to appear. That during such
a crucial period, and for some years following, but little or no attention
was anywhere given to the question of education was only natural.

NO REAL EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS BEFORE ABOUT 1820. Regardless of the
national land grants for education made to the new States (p. 523), the
provisions of the different state constitutions (R. 259), the beginnings
made here and there in the few cities of the time, and the early state
laws (R. 262), it can hardly be said that the American people had
developed an educational consciousness, outside of New England and New
York, before about 1820, and in some of the States, especially in the
South, a state educational consciousness was not awakened until very much
later. Even in New England there was a steady decline in education during
the first fifty years of the national history.

There were many reasons in the national life for this lack of interest in
education among the masses of the people. The simple agricultural life of
the time, the homogeneity of the people, the absence of cities, the
isolation and independence of the villages, the lack of full manhood
suffrage in a number of the States, the want of any economic demand for
education, and the fact that no important political question calling for
settlement at the polls had as yet arisen, made the need for schools and
learning seem a relatively minor one. The country, too, was still very
poor. The Revolutionary War debt still hung in part over the Nation, and
the demand for money and labor for all kinds of internal improvements was
very large. The country had few industries, and its foreign trade was
badly hampered by European nations. Ways and means of strengthening the
existing Government and holding the Union together, [1] rather than plans
which could bear fruit only in the future, occupied the attention of the
leaders of the time.

When the people had finally settled their political and commercial future
by the War of 1812-14, and had built up a national consciousness on a
democratic basis in the years immediately following, and the Nation at
last possessed the energy, the money, and the interest for doing so, they
finally turned their energies toward the creation of a democratic system
of public schools. In the meantime, education, outside of New England, and
in part even there, was left largely to private individuals, churches,
incorporated school societies, and such state schools for the children of
the poor as might have been provided by private or state funds, or the two
combined.

THE REAL INTEREST IN ADVANCED EDUCATION. In so far as the American people
may be said to have possessed a real interest in education during the
first half-century of the national existence, it was manifested in the
establishment and endowment of academies and colleges rather than in the
creation of schools for the people. The colonial Latin grammar school had
been almost entirely an English institution, and never well suited to
American needs. As democratic consciousness began to arise, the demand
came for a more practical institution, less exclusive and less
aristocratic in character, and better adapted in its instruction to the
needs of a frontier society. Arising about the middle of the eighteenth
century, a number of so-called Academies had been founded before the new
National Government took shape. While essentially private institutions,
arising from a church foundation, or more commonly a local subscription or
endowment, it became customary for towns, counties, and States to assist
in their maintenance, thus making them semi-public institutions. Their
management, though, usually remained in private hands, or under boards or
associations. [2]

Beside offering a fair type of higher training [3] before the days of high
schools, the academies also became training-schools for teachers, and
before the rise of the normal schools were the chief source of supply for
the better grade of elementary teachers. These institutions rendered an
important service during the first half of the nineteenth century, but
were in time displaced by the publicly supported and publicly controlled
American high school, the first of which dates from 1821. This evolution
we shall describe more in detail a little later on.

THE COLLEGES OF THE TIME. Some interest also was taken in college
education during this early national period. College attendance, however,
was small, as the country was still new and the people were poor. As late
as 1815, Harvard graduated a class of but 66; Yale of 69; Princeton of 40;
Williams of 40; Pennsylvania of 15; and the University of South Carolina
of 37. After the organization of the Union the nine old colonial colleges
were reorganized, and an attempt was made to bring them into closer
harmony with the ideas and needs of the people and the governments of the
States. Dartmouth, Kings (now rechristened Columbia), and Pennsylvania
were for a time changed into state institutions, and an unsuccessful
attempt was made to make a state university for Virginia out of William
and Mary. Fifteen additional colleges were organized by 1800, and fourteen
more by 1820. Between 1790 and 1825 there was much discussion as to the
desirability of founding a national university at the seat of government,
and Washington in his will (1799) left, for that time, a considerable sum
to the Nation to inaugurate the new undertaking. Nothing ever came of it,
however. Before 1825 six States--Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Indiana, and Michigan--had laid the foundations of future state
universities. The National Government had also granted to each new Western
State two entire townships of land to help endow a university in each--a
stimulus which eventually led to the establishment of a state university
in every Western State.

A HALF-CENTURY OF TRANSITION. The first half-century of the national life
may be regarded as a period of transition from the church-control idea of
education over to the idea of education under the control of and supported
by the State. Though many of the early States had provided for state
school systems in their constitutions (R. 259), the schools had not been
set up, or set up only here and there. It required time to make this
change in thinking. Up to the period of the beginnings of our national
development education had almost everywhere been regarded as an affair of
the Church, somewhat akin to baptism, marriage, the administration of the
sacraments, and the burial of the dead. Even in New England, which formed
an exception, the evolution of the civic school from the church school was
not yet complete.

The church charity-school had become, as we have seen (p. 449), a familiar
institution before the Revolution. The English "Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts" (p. 449), which maintained
schools in connection with the Anglican churches in the Anglican Colonies
and provided an excellent grade of charity-school master, withdrew at the
close of the Revolutionary War from work in this country. The different
churches after the war continued their efforts to maintain their church
charity-schools, though there was for a time a decrease in both their
numbers and their effectiveness.

In the meantime the demand for education grew rather rapidly, and the task
soon became too big for the churches to handle. For long the churches made
an effort to keep up, as they were loath to relinquish in any way their
former hold on the training of the young. The churches, however, were not
interested in the problem except in the old way, and this was not what the
new democracy wanted. The result was that, with the coming of nationality
and the slow but gradual growth of a national consciousness, national
pride, national needs, and the gradual development of national resources
in the shape of taxable property--all alike combined to make secular
instead of religious schools seem both desirable and possible to a
constantly increasing number of citizens.


II. AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS

Between about 1810 and 1830 a number of new forces--philanthropic,
political, social, economic--combined to change the earlier attitude by
producing conditions which made state rather than church control and
support of education seem both desirable and feasible. The change, too,
was markedly facilitated by the work of a number of semi-private
philanthropic agencies which now began the work of founding schools and
building up an interest in education, the most important of which were:
(1) the Sunday-School movement; (2) the City School Societies; (3) the
Lancastrian movement; and (4) the Infant-School Societies. These will be
described briefly, and their influence in awakening an educational
consciousness pointed out.

THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL MOVEMENT. The Sunday School, as a means of providing the
merest rudiments of secular and religious learning, had been made, through
the initiative of Raikes of Gloucester (p. 617), a very important English
institution for providing the beginnings of instruction for the children
of the city poor. Raikes's idea was soon carried to the United States. In
1786 a Sunday School after the Raikes plan was organized in Hanover
County, Virginia. In 1787 a Sunday School for African children was
organized at Charleston, South Carolina. In 1791 "The First Day, or Sunday
School Society," was organized at Philadelphia, for the establishment of
Sunday Schools in that city. In 1793 Katy Ferguson's "School for the Poor"
was opened in New York, and this was followed by an organization of New
York women for the extension of secular instruction among the poor. In
1797 Samuel Slater's Factory School was opened at Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

Though there had been some Sunday instruction earlier at a few places in
New England, the introduction of the Sunday School from England, in 1786,
marked the real beginning of the religious Sunday School in America. After
the churches had once caught the idea of a common religious school on
Sundays for the instruction of any one, a number of societies were formed
to carry on and extend the work. The most important of these were:

    1808. The Evangelical Society of Philadelphia.
    1816. The Female Union for the Promotion of Sabbath Schools (New
          York).
    1816. The New York Sunday School Union.
    1816. The Boston Society for the Moral and Religious Instruction of
          the Poor.
    1817. The Philadelphia Sunday and Adult School Union.
    1824. The American Sunday School Union.

These different types of American Sunday Schools, being open to all
instead of only to the poor and lowly, had a small but an increasing
influence in leveling class distinctions and in making a common day school
seem possible. The movement for secular instruction on Sundays, though,
soon met in America with the opposition of the churches, and before long
they took over the idea, superseded private initiative and control, and
changed the character of the instruction from a day of secular work to an
hour or so of religious teaching. The Sunday School, in consequence, never
exercised the influence in educational development in America that it did
in England.

THE CITY SCHOOL SOCIETIES. These were patterned after the English charity-
school subscription societies, and were formed in a number of American
cities during the first quarter of the nineteenth century for the purpose
of providing the rudiments of an education to those too poor to pay for
schooling. These Societies were usually organized by philanthropic
citizens, willing to contribute something yearly to provide some little
education for a few of the many children in the city having no
opportunities for any instruction. A number of these Societies were able
to effect some financial connection with the city or the State.

One of the first of these School Societies was "The Manumission Society,"
organized in New York, in 1785, for the purpose of "mitigating the evils
of slavery, to defend the rights of the blacks, and especially to give
them the elements of an education." Alexander Hamilton and John Jay were
among its organizers. A free school for colored pupils was opened, in
1787. This grew and prospered and was aided from time to time by the city,
and in 1801 by the State. Finally, in 1834, all its schools were merged
with those of the "Public School Society" of the city. In 1801 the first
free school for poor white children "whose parents belong to no religious
society, and who, from some cause or other, cannot be admitted into any of
the charity schools of the city," was opened. This was provided by the
"Association of Women Friends for the Relief of the Poor," which engaged
"a widow woman of good education and morals as instructor" at £30 per
year. This Association also prospered, and received some city or state aid
up to 1824. By 1823 it was providing free elementary education for 750
children. Its schools also were later merged with those of the "Public
School Society."

"THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SOCIETY." Perhaps the most famous of all the early
subscription societies for the maintenance of schools for the poor was the
"New York Free School Society," which later changed its name to that of
"The Public School Society of New York."  This was organized, in 1805,
under the leadership of De Witt Clinton, then mayor of the city, he
heading the subscription list with a promise of $200 a year for support.
On May 14, 1806, the following advertisement appeared in the daily papers:

    FREE SCHOOL

    The Trustees of the Society for establishing a Free School in the city
    of New York, for the education of such poor children as do not belong
    to, or are not provided for by any religious Society, having engaged a
    Teacher, and procured a School House for the accommodation of a
    School, have now the pleasure of announcing that it is proposed to
    receive scholars of the descriptions alluded to without delay;
    applications may be made to, &c.

Four days later the officers of the Society issued a general appeal to the
public (R. 311), setting forth the purposes of the Society and soliciting
funds.

[Illustration: FIG. 196. THE FIRST SCHOOLHOUSE BUILT BY THE FREE SCHOOL
SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY
Built in 1809, in Tryon Row. Cost, without site, $13,000.]

This Society was chartered by the legislature "to provide schooling for
all children who are the proper objects of a gratuitous education." It
organized free public education in the city, secured funds, built
schoolhouses, provided and trained teachers, and ably supplemented the
work of the private and church schools. By its energy and its persistence
it secured for itself a large share of public confidence, and aroused a
constantly increasing interest in the cause of popular education. In 1853,
after it had educated over 600,000 children and trained over 1200
teachers, this Society, its work done, surrendered its charter and turned
over its buildings and equipment to the public-school department of the
city, which had been created by the legislature in 1842.

SCHOOL SOCIETIES ELSEWHERE. The "Benevolent Society of the City of
Baltimore for the Education of the Female Poor," founded in 1799, and the
"Male Free Society of Baltimore," organized a little later, were other of
these early school societies, though neither became so famous as the
Public School Society of New York. The schools of the city of Washington
were started by subscription, in 1804, and for some time were in part
supported by subscriptions from public-spirited citizens. [4] This society
did an important work in accustoming the people of the capital city to the
provision of some form of free education.

In 1800 "The Philadelphia Society [5] for the Free Instruction of Indigent
Boys" was formed, which a little later changed to "The Philadelphia
Society for the Establishment and Support of Charity Schools." In 1814
"The Society for the Promotion of a Rational System of Education" was
organized in Philadelphia, and four years later the public sentiment
awakened by a combination of the work of this Society and the coming of
the Lancastrian system of instruction enabled the city to secure a special
law permitting Philadelphia to organize a system of city schools for the
education of the children of its poor. Other societies which rendered
useful educational service include the "Mechanics and Manufacturers
Association," of Providence, Rhode Island, organized in 1789 (Rs. 308,
310); "The Albany Lancastrian School Society," organized in 1826, for the
education of the poor of the city in monitorial schools; and the school
societies organized in Savannah in 1818, and Augusta, in 1821, "to afford
education to the children of indigent parents." Both these Georgia
societies received some support from state funds.

The formation of these school societies, the subscriptions made by the
leading men of the cities, the bequests for education, and the grants of
some city and state aid to these societies, all of which in time became
somewhat common, indicate a slowly rising interest in providing schools
for the education of all. This rising interest in education was greatly
stimulated by the introduction from England, about this time, of a new and
what for the time seemed a wonderful system for the organization of
education, the Lancastrian monitorial plan.

THE LANCASTRIAN MONITORIAL SCHOOLS. Church-of-England ideas were not in
much favor in the United States for some time after the close of the
Revolutionary War, and in consequence it was the Lancastrian plan which
was brought over and popularized. In 1806 the first monitorial school was
opened in New York City, and, once introduced, the system quickly spread
from Massachusetts to Georgia, and as far west as Cincinnati, Louisville,
and Detroit. In 1826 Maryland instituted a state system of Lancastrian
schools, with a Superintendent of Public Instruction, but in 1828
abandoned the idea and discontinued the office. A state Lancastrian system
for North Carolina was proposed in 1832, but failed of adoption by the
legislature. In 1829 Mexico organized higher Lancastrian schools for the
Mexican State of Texas. In 1818 Lancaster himself went to America, and was
received with much distinction. Most of the remaining twenty years of his
life were spent in organizing and directing schools in various parts of
the United States.

In many of the rising cities of the eastern part of the country the first
free schools established were Lancastrian schools. The system provided
education at so low a cost (p. 629) that it made the education of all for
the first time seem possible. [6] The first free schools in Philadelphia
(1818) were an outgrowth of Lancastrian influence, as was also the case in
many other Pennsylvania cities. Baltimore began a Lancastrian school six
years before the organization of public schools was permitted by law. A
number of monitorial high schools were organized in different parts of the
United States, and it was even proposed that the plan should be adopted in
the colleges. A number of New England cities, that already had other type
schools, investigated the new monitorial plan and were impressed with its
many important points of superiority over methods then in use. The Report
of the Investigating Committee (1828) for Boston (R. 312), forms a good
example of such. As in England, the system was very popular from about
1810 to 1830, but by 1840 its popularity was over.

THE INTEREST THE NEW PLAN AWAKENED. It is not strange that the new plan
aroused widespread enthusiasm in many discerning men, and for almost a
quarter of a century was advocated as the best system of education then
known. Two quotations will illustrate what leading men of the time thought
of it. De Witt Clinton, for twenty-one years president of the New York
"Free School Society," and later governor of the State, wrote, in 1809:

    When I perceive that many boys in our school have been taught to read
    and write in two months, who did not before know the alphabet, and
    that even one has accomplished it in three weeks--when I view all the
    bearings and tendencies of this system--when I contemplate the habits
    of order which it forms, the spirit of emulation which it excites, the
    rapid improvement which it produces, the purity of morals which it
    inculcates--when I behold the extraordinary union of celerity in
    instruction and economy of expense--and when I perceive one great
    assembly of a thousand children, under the eye of a single teacher,
    marching with unexampled rapidity and with perfect discipline to the
    goal of knowledge, I confess that I recognize in Lancaster the
    benefactor of the human race. I consider his system as creating a new
    era in education, as a blessing sent down from heaven to redeem the
    poor and distressed of this world from the power and dominion of
    ignorance.

In a message to the legislature of Connecticut, a State then fairly well
supplied with schools of the Massachusetts district type, Governor Wolcott
said, in 1825:

    If funds can be obtained to defray the expenses of the necessary
    preparations, I have no doubt that schools on the Lancastrian model
    ought, as soon as possible, to be established in several parts of this
    state. Wherever from 200 to 1000 children can be convened within a
    suitable distance, this mode of instruction in every branch of
    reading, speaking, penmanship, arithmetic, and bookkeeping, will be
    found much more efficient, direct, and economical than the practices
    now generally pursued in our primary schools.

The Lancastrian schools materially hastened the adoption of the free
school system in all the Northern States by gradually accustoming people
to bearing the necessary taxation which free schools entail. They also
made the common school common and much talked of, and awakened thought and
provoked discussion on the question of public education. They likewise
dignified the work of the teacher by showing the necessity for teacher-
training. The Lancastrian Model Schools, first established in the United
States in 1818, were the precursors of the American normal schools.

COMING OF THE INFANT SCHOOL. A curious early condition in America was
that, in some of the cities where public schools had been established, by
one agency or another, no provision had been made for beginners. These
were supposed to obtain the elements of reading at home, or in the Dame
Schools. In Boston, for example, where public schools were maintained by
the city, no children could be received into the schools who had not
learned to read and write (R. 314 a). This made the common age of
admission somewhere near eight years. The same was in part true of
Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities. When the
monitorial schools were established they tended to restrict their
membership in a similar manner, though not always able to do so.

In 1816 there came to America, also from England, a valuable supplement to
education as then known in the form of the so-called Infant Schools (p.
630). First introduced at Boston (R. 313), the Infant Schools proved
popular, and in 1818 the city appropriated $5000 for the purpose of
organizing such schools to supplement the public-school system. These were
to admit children at four years of age, were to be known as primary
schools, were to be taught by women, were to be open all the year round,
and were to prepare the children for admission to the city schools, which
by that time had come to be known as English grammar schools. Providence,
similarly, established primary (Infant) schools in 1828 for children
between the ages of four and eight, to supplement the work of the public
schools, there called writing schools.

THE DAME SCHOOL ABSORBED. For New England the establishment of primary
schools virtually took over the Dame School instruction as a public
function, and added the primary grades to the previously existing school.
We have here the origin of the division, often still retained at least in
name in the Eastern States, of the "primary grades" and the "grammar
grades" of the elementary school.

[Illustration: FIG. 197 "MODEL" SCHOOL BUILDING OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SOCIETY
Erected in 1843. _
We sailed into Salcombe on Saturday evening, in a hired yacht of twenty-eight
tons, after beating around the Start and Prawl against a sou'westerly wind
and a strong spring tide. Now the tide off the Start has to be studied.
To begin with, it does not coincide in point of time with the tide
inshore. The flood, or east stream, for instance, only starts to run
there some three hours before it is high water at Salcombe; but, having
started, runs with a vengeance, or, to be more precise, at something
like three knots an hour during the high springs; and the consequence
is a very lively race.

Moreover, the bottom all the way from Start Point to Bolt Tail is extremely
rough and irregular, which means that some ten or twelve miles of vicious
seas can be set going on very short notice. Altogether you may spend a
few hours here as uncomfortably as anywhere up or down Channel, with the
single exception of Portland Race. If you turn aside for Salcombe, there
is the bar to be considered; and Salcombe bar is a danger to be treated
with grave respect. The _Channel Pilot_ will tell us why:--
"There is 8 ft. water at L.W. springs on the bar at the entrance, but
there are patches of 6 feet. Vessels drawing 20 ft. can cross it (_when
the sea is smooth_) at H.W. springs, and those of 16 ft. at H.W. neaps.
In S. gales there is a breaking, heavy sea, and no vessel should then
attempt the bar; in moderate S.
winds vessels may take it at high water."

The bearing of these observations on the present narrative will appear anon.
For the present, entering Salcombe with plenty of water and a moderate
S.W. breeze, we had nothing to distract our attention from the beauty of
the spot. I suppose it to be the most imposing river-entrance on the south
coast; perhaps the most imposing on any of the coasts of Britain.

But being lazy and by habit a shirker of word-painting, I must have
recourse to the description given in Mr.

Arthur Underhill's _Our Silver Streak_, most useful and pleasant of
handbooks for yachtsmen cruising in the Channel:--
"As we approach Salcombe Head (part of Bolt Head), its magnificent form
becomes more apparent. It is said to be about four hundred and thirty
feet in height, but it looks very much more. Its base is hollowed
out into numerous caverns, into which the sea dashes, while the profile
of the head, often rising some forty or fifty feet sheer from the water,
slopes back at an angle of about forty-five degrees in one long upward
sweep, broken in the most fantastic way into numerous pinnacles and
needles, which remind one forcibly of the _aiguilles_ of the
valley of Chamounix. I do not think that any headland in the Channel is
so impressive as this."

As we passed it, its needles stood out darkly against a rare amber sky--
such a glow as is only seen for a brief while before a sunset following
much rain; and it had been raining, off and on, for a week past.

I daresay that to the weatherwise this glow signified yet dirtier weather
in store; but we surrendered ourselves to the charm of the hour.

Unconscious of their doom the little victims played.

We crossed the bar, sailed past the beautiful house in which Froude spent
so many years, sailed past the little town, rounded a point, saw a long
quiet stretch of river before us, and cast anchor in deep water. The address
at the head of this paper is no sportive invention of mine. You
may verify it by the Ordnance Map. We were in the Bag.

I awoke that night to the hum of wind in the rigging and the patter of
rain on deck. It blew and rained all the morning, and at noon took
a fresh breath and began to blow viciously.

After luncheon we abandoned our project of walking to Bolt Head,
and chose such books from the cabin library as might decently excuse an
afternoon's siesta. A scamper of feet fetched me out of my berth and
up on deck. By this time a small gale was blowing, and to our slight dismay
the boat had dragged her anchors and carried us up into sight of Kingsbridge.
Luckily our foolish career was arrested for the moment; and, still more
luckily, within handy distance of a buoy--laid there, I believe,
for the use of vessels under quarantine.

We carried out a hawser to this buoy, and waited until the tide should
ease and allow us to warp down to it. Our next business was with the
peccant anchors. We had two down--the best anchor and kedge; and supposed
at first that the kedge must have parted. But a couple of minutes at
the capstan reassured us. It was the kedge which had been holding us, to
the extent of its small ability. And the Bag is an excellent anchorage
after all, but not if you happen to get your best anchor foul of its
chain. We hauled up, cleared, warped down to the buoy; and then, hoisting
mizzen and headsails, cast loose and worked back to our old quarters.

The afternoon's amusement, though exciting enough in its way, was
not what we had come to Salcombe to seek.

And since the weather promised nothing better, and already a heap
of more or less urgent letters must be gathering dust in the post office
at Plymouth, we resolved to beat over the bar at high water next morning
(_this_ morning), and, as Mr. Lang puts it, 'know the brine salt on our
lips, and the large air again': for there promised to be plenty of both
between Bolt Head and the Mewstone.

'Shun delays, they breed remorse,' and 'Time wears all his locks before'
(or, as the Fourth-form boy translated it in pentameter, "_Tempus
habet nullat posteriori comas_"). The fault was mine for wasting an invaluable
hour among the 'shy traffickers' of Salcombe. By the time we worked down
to the bar the tide had been ebbing for an hour and a half.

The wind still blew strong from the south-west, and the seas on the bar
were not pleasant to contemplate. Let alone the remoter risk of
scraping on one of the two shallow patches which diversify the west (and
only practicable) side of the entrance, it one of those big fellows happened
to stagger us at the critical moment of 'staying' it would pretty
certainly mean disaster. Also the yacht (as I began by saying) was a hired
one, and the captain tender about his responsibility. Rather ignominiously,
therefore, we turned tail; and just as we did so, a handsome sea, arched
and green, the tallest of the lot, applauded our prudence. All the same,
our professional pride was wounded. To stay at anchor is one thing: to
weigh and stand for the attempt and then run home again 'hard up,' as a
sailor would say, is quite another. There was a Greek mariner, the other
day, put on his trial with one or two comrades for murder and mutiny on the
high seas. They had disapproved of their captain's altering the
helm, and had pitched him incontinently overboard.

On being asked what he had to say in his defence, the prisoner merely
cast up his hands and sobbed, "Oh, cursed hour in which we put about!" We
recalled this simple but apposite story.

Having seen to our anchor and helped to snug down the mainsail, I went
below in the very worst of tempers, to find the cabin floor littered
with the contents of a writing-case and a box of mixed biscuits, which
had broken loose in company. As I stooped to collect the _debris_, this
appeal (type-written) caught my eye:--
"Dear Sir,--Our paper is contemplating a Symposium of literary and eminent
men--"
(Observe the distinction.)
"--On the subject of 'What is your favourite Modern Lyric?' I need not say
how much interest would attach to the opinion of one who," etc.

I put my head up the companion and addressed a friend who was lacing tight
the cover of the mainsail viciously, with the help of his teeth.

"Look here, X," I said. "What is your favourite Modern Lyric?"
"That one," he answered (still with the lace between his teeth), "which
begins--

"'Curse the people, blast the people, Damn the lower orders!'"
X as a rule calls himself a Liberal-Conservative: but a certain
acerbity of temper may be forgiven in a man who has just assisted (against
all his instincts) in an act of poltroonery. He explained, too, that
it was a genuine, if loosely remembered, quotation from Ebenezer Elliott,
the Corn Law Rhymer. "Yet in circumstances of peril," he went on, "and
in moments of depression, you cannot think what sustenance I have
derived from those lines."
"Then you had best send them up," said I, "to the _Daily Post_.

It is conducting a Symposium."
"If two wrongs do not make a right," he answered tartly, "even less will
an assembly of deadly dry persons make something to drink."

That evening, in the cabin, we held a symposium on our own account and in
the proper sense of the term, while the rain drummed on the deck and
the sky-lights.

X said, "The greatest poem written on love during these fifty years--and
we agree to accept love as the highest theme of lyrical poetry--is
George Meredith's _Love in the Valley_. I say this and decline to argue
about it."
"Nor am I disposed to argue about it," I answered, "for York Powell--peace
to his soul for a great man gone--held that same belief. In his rooms
in Christ Church, one night while _The Oxford Book of Verse_ was preparing
and I had come to him, as everyone came, for counsel. . . . I take it,
though, that we are not searching for the absolute best but for our own
prime favourite. You remember what Swinburne says somewhere of Hugo's
_Gastibelza_:--
"'Gastibelza, l'homme a la carabine, Chantait ainsi:

Quelqu'un a-t-il connu Dona Sabine?
Quelqu'un d'ici?
Dansez, chantez, villageois! la nuit gagne Le mont Falou-- Le vent qui
vient a travers la montagne Me rendra fou!'
"'The song of songs which is Hugo's,' he calls it; and goes on to
ask how often one has chanted or shouted or otherwise declaimed it
to himself, on horseback at full gallop or when swimming at his
best as a boy in holiday time; and how often the matchless music,
ardour, pathos of it have not reduced his own ambition to a sort
of rapturous and adoring despair--yes, and requickened his old
delight in it with a new delight in the sense that he will always
have this to rejoice in, to adore, and to recognise as something
beyond the reach of man.

Well, that is the sense in which our poem should be our favourite poem.
Now, for my part, there's a page or so of Browning's _Saul_--"
"What do you say to Meredith's _Phoebus with Admetus?

_" interrupted X.

I looked up at him quickly, almost shamefacedly. "Now, how on earth did you
guess--"
X laid down his pipe, stared up at the sky-light, and quoted, almost under
his breath:--
"'Bulls that walk the pasture in kingly-flashing coats!
Laurel, ivy, vine, wreath'd for feasts not few!'"

Why is it possible to consider Mr.

Meredith--whose total yield of verse has been so scanty and the most
of it so 'harsh and crabbed,' as not only 'dull fools' suppose--beside
the great poets who have been his contemporaries, and to feel no
impropriety in the comparison?

    That was the question X and I found ourselves discussing, ten minutes
    later.
    
    "Because," maintained X, "you feel at once that with Meredith you
    have hold of a man. You know--as surely, for example, as while you
    are listening to Handel--that the stuff is masculine, and great at
    that."
    "That is not all the secret," I maintained, "although it gets near to
    the secret. Why is it possible to consider Coleridge alongside of
    Wordsworth and Byron, yet feel no impropriety? Coleridge's yield
    of verse was ridiculously scanty beside theirs, and a deal more
sensuous than Wordsworth's, at any rate, and yet more manly, in a
sense, than Byron's, which again was thoroughly manly within the
range of emotion?

Why?
Because Coleridge and Meredith both have a philosophy of life: and he
who has a philosophy of life may write little or much; may on the one
hand write _Christabel_ and leave it unfinished and decline upon opium;
or may, on the other hand, be a Browning or a Meredith, and 'keep up his
end' (as the saying is) nobly to the last, and vex us all the while
with his asperities; and yet in both cases be as certainly a masculine
poet.

    Poetry (as I have been contending all my life) has one right
    background and one only: and that background is philosophy. You say,
    Coleridge and Meredith are masculine. I ask, Why are they masculine?
    The answer is, They have philosophy."
    "You are on the old tack again: the old 'to katholoy'!"
    "Yes, and am going to hold upon it until we fetch land, so you may e'en
    fill another pipe and play the interlocutor. . . . You remember my
    once asking why our Jingo poets write such rotten poetry (for that their
    stuff is rotten we agreed).

The reason is, they are engaged in mistaking the part for the whole, and
that part a non-essential one; they are setting up the present potency
of Great Britain as a triumphant and insolent exception to laws which
(if we believe in any gods better than anarchy and chaos) extend at least
over all human conduct and may even regulate 'the most ancient
heavens.' You may remember my expressed contempt for a recent poem which
lauded Henry VIII because--"
"'He was lustful, he was vengeful, he was hot and hard and proud; But
he set his England fairly in the sight of all the crowd.'
"--A worse error, to my mind, than Froude's, who merely idolised him for
chastising the clergy. Well, after our discussion, I asked myself this
question: 'Why do we not as a great Empire-making people, ruling the world
for its good, assassinate the men who oppose us?' We do not; the
idea revolts us. But why does it revolt us?

"We send our armies to fight, with the certainty (if we think at all) that
we are sending a percentage to be killed. We recently sent out two hundred
thousand with the sure and certain knowledge that some thousands
must die; and these (we say) were men agonising for a righteous
cause.

Why did it not afflict us to send them?

--whereas it would have afflicted us inexpressibly to send a man to end
the difficulty by putting a bullet or a knife into Mr. Kruger, who
_ex hypothesi_ represented an unrighteous cause, and who certainly was
but one man.

"Why? Because a law above any that regulates the expansion of Great Britain
says, 'That shalt do no murder.' And that law, that Universal, takes
the knife or the pistol quietly, firmly, out of your hand. You send
a battalion, with Tom Smith in it, to fight Mr. Kruger's troops; you know
that some of them must in all likelihood perish; but, thank your
stars, you do not know their names. Tom Smith, as it happens, is killed;
but had you known with absolute certainty that Tom Smith would be
killed, you could not have sent him. You must have withdrawn him,
and substituted some other fellow concerning whom your prophetic
vision was less uncomfortably definite. You can kill Tom Smith if
he has happened to kill Bob Jones: you are safe enough then, being
able to excuse yourself--how?
By Divine law again (as you understand it). Divine law says that
whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed--that
is to say, by you: so you can run under cover and hang Tom Smith.
But when Divine law does not protect you, you are powerless. At the
most you can send him off to take his ten-to-one chance in a
battalion, and when you read his name in the returns, come mincing
up to God and say: 'So poor old Tom's gone!
How the deuce was _I_ to know?'
"I say nothing of the cowardice of this, though it smells to Heaven.Excepting the battle for the abolition
of slavery, perhaps no question has ever been before the American people
for settlement which caused so much feeling or aroused such bitter
antagonisms. The friends of free schools were at first commonly regarded
as fanatics, dangerous to the State, and the opponents of free schools
were considered by them as old-time conservatives or as selfish members of
society.

Naturally such a bitter discussion of a public question forced an
alignment of the people for or against publicly supported and controlled
schools, and this alignment of interests may be roughly stated to have
been about as follows:

    _I. For Public Schools._
    Men considered as:
    1. "Citizens of the Republic."
    2. Philanthropists and humanitarians.
    3. Public men of large vision.
    4. City residents.
    5. The intelligent workingmen in the cities.
    6. Non-taxpayers.
    7. Calvinists.
    8. "New England men."

    _II. Lukewarm, or against Public Schools._
    Men considered as:
    1. Belonging to the old aristocratic class.
    2. The conservatives of society.
    3. Politicians of small vision.
    4. Residents of rural districts.
    5. The ignorant, narrow-minded, and penurious.
    6. Taxpayers.
    7. Lutherans, Reformed-Church, Mennonites, and Quakers.
    8. Southern men.
    9. Proprietors of private schools.
    10. The non-English-speaking classes.

THE WORK OF PROPAGANDA. To meet the arguments of the objectors, to change
the opinions of a thinking few into the common opinion of the many, to
overcome prejudice, and to awaken the public conscience to the public need
for free and common schools in such a democratic society, was the work of
a generation. To convince the masses of the people that the scheme of
state schools was not only practicable, but also the best and most
economical means for giving their children the benefits of an education;
to convince propertied citizens that taxation for education was in the
interests of both public and private welfare; to convince legislators that
it was safe to vote for free-school bills; and to overcome the opposition
due to apathy, religious jealousies, and private interests, was the work
of years. In time, though, the desirability of common, free, tax-
supported, non-sectarian, state-controlled schools became evident to a
majority of the citizens in the different American States, and as it did
the American State School, free and equally open to all, was finally
evolved and took its place as the most important institution in the
national life working for the perpetuation of a free democracy and the
advancement of the public welfare.

For this work of propaganda hundreds of School Societies and Educational
Associations were organized; many conventions were held, and many
resolutions favoring state schools were adopted; many "Letters" and
"Addresses to the Public" were written and published; public-spirited
citizens traveled over the country, making addresses to the people
explaining the advantages of free state schools; many public-spirited men
gave the best years of their lives to the state-school propaganda; and
many governors sent communications on the subject to legislatures not yet
convinced as to the desirability of state action. At each meeting of the
legislatures for years a deluge of resolutions, memorials, and petitions
for and against free schools met the members.

The invention of the steam printing press came at about this time, and the
first modern newspapers at a cheap price now appeared. These usually
espoused progressive measures, and tremendously influenced public
sentiment. Those not closely connected with church or private-school
interests usually favored public tax-supported schools.

CHAPTER XXVI

THE AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS


The problem which confronted those interested in establishing state-
controlled schools was not exactly the same in any two States, though the
battle in many States possessed common elements, and hence was somewhat
similar in character. Instead of tracing the struggle in detail in each of
the different States, it will be much more profitable for our purposes to
pick out the main strategic points in the contest, and then illustrate the
conflict for these by describing conditions in one or two States where the
controversy was most severe or most typical. The seven strategic points in
the struggle for free, tax-supported, non-sectarian, state-controlled
schools in the United States were:

    1. The battle for tax support.
    2. The battle to eliminate the pauper-school idea.
    3. The battle to make the schools entirely free.
    4. The battle to establish state supervision.
    5. The battle to eliminate sectarianism.
    6. The battle to extend the system upward.
    7. Addition of the state university to crown the system.

We shall consider each of these, briefly, in order.


I. THE BATTLE FOR TAX SUPPORT

EARLY SUPPORT AND ENDOWMENT FUNDS. In New England, land endowments, local
taxes, direct local appropriations, license taxes, and rate-bills had long
been common. Land endowments began early in the New England Colonies,
while rate-bills date back to the earliest times and long remained a
favorite means of raising money for school support. These means were
adopted in the different States after the beginning of our national
period, and to them were added a variety of license taxes, while
occupational taxes, lotteries, and bank taxes also were employed to raise
money for schools. A few examples of these may be cited:

Connecticut, in 1774, turned over all proceeds of liquor licenses to the
towns where collected, to be used for schools. New Orleans, in 1826,
licensed two theaters on condition that they each pay $3000 annually for
the support of schools in the city. New York, in 1799, authorized four
state lotteries to raise $100,000 for schools, a similar amount again in
1801, and numerous other lotteries before 1810. New Jersey (R. 246) and
most of the other States did the same. Congress passed fourteen joint
resolutions, between 1812 and 1836, authorizing lotteries to help support
the schools of the city of Washington. Bank taxes were a favorite source
of income for schools, between about 1825 and 1860, banks being chartered
on condition that they would pay over each year for schools a certain sum
or percentage of their earnings. These all represent what is known as
indirect taxation, and were valuable in accustoming the people to the idea
of public schools without appearing to tax them for their support.

The National Land Grants, begun in the case of Ohio in 1802, soon
stimulated a new interest in schools. Each State admitted after Ohio also
received the sixteenth section for the support of common schools, and two
townships of land for the endowment of a state university. The new Western
States, following the lead of Ohio (R. 260) and Indiana (R. 261),
dedicated these section lands and funds to free common schools. The
sixteen older States, however, did not share in these grants, so most of
them now set about building up a permanent school fund of their own,
though at first without any very clear idea as to how the income from the
fund was to be used. [1]

THE BEGINNINGS OF SCHOOL TAXATION. The early idea, which seems for a time
to have been generally entertained, that the income from land grants,
license fees, and these permanent endowment funds would in time entirely
support the necessary schools, was gradually abandoned as it was seen how
little in yearly income these funds and lands really produced, and how
rapidly the population of the States was increasing. By 1825 it may be
said to have been clearly recognized by thinking men that the only safe
reliance of a system of state schools lay in the general and direct
taxation of all property for their support. "The wealth of the State must
educate the children of the State" became a watchword, and the battle for
direct, local, county, and state taxation for education was clearly on by
1825 to 1830 in all the Northern States, except the four in New England
where the principle of taxation for education had for long been
established. [2] Even in these States the struggle to increase taxation
and provide better schools called for much argument and popular education
(R. 316), and occasional backward movements (Rs. 317, 318) were
encountered.

[Illustration: FIG. 200. THE FIRST FREE PUBLIC SCHOOL IN DETROIT
A one-room school, opened in the Second Ward, in 1838. No action was taken
in any other ward until 1842.]

The struggle to secure the first legislation, weak and ineffective as it
seems to us to-day, was often hard and long. "Campaigns of education" had
to be prepared for and carried through. Many thought that tax-supported
schools would be dangerous for the State, harmful to individual good, and
thoroughly undemocratic. Many did not see the need for schools at all.
Portions of a town or a city would provide a free school, while other
portions would not. Often those in favor of taxation were bitterly
assailed, and even at times threatened with personal violence. Often those
in favor of improving the school had to wait patiently for the opposition
slowly to wear itself out (R. 319) before any real progress could be made.

STATE SUPPORT FIXED THE STATE SYSTEM. With the beginnings of state aid in
any substantial sums, either from the income from permanent endowment
funds, state appropriations, or direct state taxation, the State became,
for the first time, in a position to enforce quite definite requirements
in many matters. Communities which would not meet the State's requirements
would receive no state funds.

One of the first requirements to be thus enforced was that communities or
districts receiving state aid must also levy a local tax for schools.
Commonly the requirement was a duplication of state aid. Generally
speaking, and recognizing exceptions in a few States, this represents the
beginnings of compulsory local taxation for education. As early as 1797
Vermont had required the towns to support their schools on penalty of
forfeiting their share of state aid. New York in 1812, Delaware in 1829,
and New Jersey in 1846 required a duplication of all state aid received.
Wisconsin, in its first constitution of 1848, required a local tax for
schools equal to one half the state aid received. The next step in state
control was to add still other requirements, as a prerequisite to
receiving state aid. One of the first of such was that a certain length of
school term, commonly three months, must be provided in each school
district. Another was the provision of free heat, and later on free
schoolbooks and supplies.

When the duplication-of-state-aid-received stage had been reached,
compulsory local taxation for education had been established, and the
great central battle for the creation of a state school system had been
won. The right to tax for support, and to compel local taxation, was the
key to the whole state system of education. From this point on the process
of evolving an adequate system of school support in any State has been
merely the further education of public opinion to see new educational
needs.


II. THE BATTLE TO ELIMINATE THE PAUPER-SCHOOL IDEA

THE PAUPER-SCHOOL IDEA. The pauper-school idea was a direct inheritance
from England, and its home in America was in the old Central and Southern
Colonies, where the old Anglican Church had been in control. New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia were the chief
representatives, though the idea had friends among certain classes of the
population in other of the older States. The new and democratic West would
not tolerate it. The pauper-school conception was a direct inheritance
from English rule, belonged to a society based on classes, and was wholly
out of place in a Republic founded on the doctrine that "all men are
created equal, and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights." Still more, it was a very dangerous conception of education for a
democratic form of government to tolerate or to foster. Its friends were
found among the old aristocratic or conservative classes, the heavy
taxpayers, the supporters of church schools, and the proprietors of
private schools. Citizens who had caught the spirit of the new Republic,
public men of large vision, intelligent workingmen, and men of the New
England type of thinking were opposed on principle to a plan which drew
such invidious distinctions between the future citizens of the State. To
educate part of the children in church or private pay schools, they said,
and to segregate those too poor to pay tuition and educate them at public
expense in pauper schools, often with the brand of pauper made very
evident to them, was certain to create classes in society which in time
would prove a serious danger to our democratic institutions.

Large numbers of those for whom the pauper schools were intended would not
brand themselves as paupers by sending their children to the schools, and
others who accepted the advantages offered, for the sake of their
children, despised the system. [3]

The battle for the elimination of the pauper-school idea was fought out in
the North in the States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and the struggle
in these two States we shall now briefly describe.

THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATION. In Pennsylvania we find the pauper-school
idea fully developed. The constitution of 1790 (R. 259) had provided for a
state system of pauper schools, but nothing was done to carry even this
constitutional direction into effect until 1802. A pauper-school law was
then enacted, directing the overseers of the poor to notify such parents
as they deemed sufficiently indigent that, if they would declare
themselves to be paupers, their children might be sent to some specified
private or pay school and be given free education (R. 315). The expense
for this was assessed against the education poor-fund, which was levied
and collected in the same manner as were road taxes or taxes for poor
relief. No provision was made for the establishment of public schools,
even for the children of the poor, nor was any standard set for the
education to be provided in the schools to which they were sent. No other
general provision for elementary education was made in the State until
1834.

With the growth of the cities, and the rise of their special problems,
something more than this very inadequate provision for schooling became
necessary. "The Philadelphia Society for the Establishment and Support of
Charity Schools" had long been urging a better system, and in 1814 "'The
Society for the Promotion of a Rational System of Education" was organized
in Philadelphia for the purpose of educational propaganda. Bills were
prepared and pushed, and in 1818 Philadelphia was permitted, by special
law, to organize as "the first school district" in the State of
Pennsylvania, and to provide, with its own funds, a system of Lancastrian
schools for the education of the children of its poor. [4]

THE LAW OF 1834. In 1827 "The Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of
Public Schools" began an educational propaganda which did much to bring
about the Free-School Act of 1834. In an "Address to the Public" it
declared its object to be the promotion of public education throughout the
State of Pennsylvania, and the "Address" closed with these words:

This Society is at present composed of about 250 members, and a
correspondence has been commenced with 125 members, who reside in every
district in the State. It is intended to direct the continued attention of
the public to the importance of the subject; to collect and diffuse all
information which may be deemed valuable; and to persevere in their labors
until they shall be crowned with success.

Memorials were presented to the legislature year after year, governors
were interested, "Addresses to the Public" were prepared, and a vigorous
propaganda was kept up until the Free-School Law of 1834 was the result.

This law, though, was optional. It created every ward, township, and
borough in the State a school district, a total of 987 being created for
the State. Each school district was ordered to vote that autumn on the
acceptance or rejection of the law. Those accepting the law were to
organize under its provisions, while those rejecting the law were to
continue under the educational provisions of the old Pauper-School Act.

[Illustration: FIG. 201. THE PENNSYLVANIA SCHOOL ELECTIONS OF 1835
Showing the percentage of school districts in each county organizing under
and accepting the School Law of 1834. Percentage of districts accepting
indicated on the map for a few of the counties.]

The results of the school elections of 1834 are shown, by counties, on the
below map. Of the total of 987 districts created, 502, in 46 of the then
52 counties (Philadelphia County not voting), or 52 per cent of the whole
number, voted to accept the new law and organize under it; 264 districts,
in 31 counties, or 27 per cent of the whole, voted definitely to reject
the law; and 221 districts, in 46 counties, or 21 per cent of the whole,
refused to take any action either way. In 3 counties, indicated on the
map, every district accepted the law, and in 5 counties, also indicated
every district rejected or refused to act on the law. It was the
predominantly German counties, located in the east-central portion of the
State, which were strongest in their opposition to the new law. One reason
for this was that the new law provided for English schools; another was
the objection of the thrifty Germans to taxation; and another was the fear
that the new state schools might injure their German parochial schools.

The real fight for free _versus_ pauper schools, though, was yet to come.
Legislators who had voted for the law were bitterly assailed, and, though
it was but an optional law, the question of its repeal and the
reinstatement of the old Pauper-School Law became the burning issue of the
campaign in the autumn of 1834. Many legislators who had favored the law
were defeated for reelection. Others, seeing defeat, refused to run.
Petitions for the repeal of the law, [5] and remonstrances against its
repeal, flooded the legislature when it met. The Senate at once repealed
the law, but the House, largely under the leadership of a Vermonter by the
name of Thaddeus Stevens, [6] refused to reconsider, and finally forced
the Senate to accept an amended and a still stronger bill. This defeat
finally settled, in principle at least, the pauper-school question in
Pennsylvania, [7] though it was not until 1873 that the last district in
the State accepted the new system.

ELIMINATING THE PAUPER-SCHOOL IDEA IN NEW JERSEY. No constitutional
mention of education was made in New Jersey until 1844, and no educational
legislation was passed until 1816. In that year a permanent state school
fund was begun, and in 1820 the first permission to levy taxes "for the
education of such poor children as are paupers" was granted. In 1828 an
extensive investigation showed that one third of the children of the State
were without educational opportunities, and as a result of this
investigation the first general school law for the State was enacted, in
1829. This provided for district schools, school trustees and visitation,
licensed teachers, local taxation, and made a state appropriation of
$20,000 a year to help establish the system. The next year, however, this
law was repealed and the old pauper-school plan reëstablished, largely due
to the pressure of church and private-school interests. In 1830 and 1831
the state appropriation was made divisible among private and parochial
schools, as well as the public pauper schools, and the use of all public
money was limited "to the education of the children of the poor."

Between 1828 and 1838 a number of conventions of friends of free public
schools were held in the State, and much work in the nature of propaganda
was done. At a convention in 1838 a committee was appointed to prepare an
"Address to the People of New Jersey" on the educational needs of the
State (R. 320), and speakers were sent over the State to talk to the
people on the subject. The campaign against the pauper school had just
been fought to a conclusion in Pennsylvania, and the result of the appeal
in New Jersey was such a popular manifestation in favor of free schools
that the legislature of 1838 instituted a partial state school system. The
pauper-school laws were repealed, and the best features of the short-lived
Law of 1829 were reënacted. In 1844 a new state constitution limited the
income of the permanent state school fund exclusively to the support of
public schools.

With the pauper-school idea eliminated from Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
the North was through with it. The wisdom of its elimination soon became
evident, and we hear little more of it among Northern people. The
democratic West never tolerated it. It continued some time longer in
Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia, and at places for a time in other
Southern States, but finally disappeared in the South as well in the
educational reorganizations which took place following the close of the
Civil War.


III. THE BATTLE TO MAKE THE SCHOOLS ENTIRELY FREE

THE SCHOOLS NOT YET FREE. The rate-bill, as we have previously stated, was
an old institution, also brought over from England, as the term "rate"
signifies. It was a charge levied upon the parent to supplement the school
revenues and prolong the school term, and was assessed in proportion to
the number of children sent by each parent to the school. In some States,
as for example Massachusetts and Connecticut, its use went back to
colonial times; in others it was added as the cost for education
increased, and it was seen that the income from permanent funds and
authorized taxation was not sufficient to maintain the school the
necessary length of time. The deficiency in revenue was charged against
the parents sending children to school, _pro rata_, and collected as
ordinary tax-bills (R. 321). The charge was small, but it was sufficient
to keep many poor children away from the schools.

The rising cities, with their new social problems, could not and would not
tolerate the rate-bill system, and one by one they secured special laws
from legislatures which enabled them to organize a city school system,
separate from city-council control, and under a local "board of
education." One of the provisions of these special laws nearly always was
the right to levy a city tax for schools sufficient to provide free
education for the children of the city.

[Illustration: FIG. 202. THE NEW YORK REFERENDUM OF 1850
Total vote: For free schools, 17 counties and 209,346 voters; against free
schools, 42 counties and 184,308 voters.]

THE FIGHT AGAINST THE RATE-BILL IN NEW YORK. The attempt to abolish the
rate-bill and make the schools wholly free was most vigorously contested
in New York State, and the contest there is most easily described. From
1828 to 1868, this tax on the parents produced an average annual sum of
$410,685.66, or about one half of the sum paid all the teachers of the
State for salary. While the wealthy districts were securing special
legislation and taxing themselves to provide free schools for their
children, the poorer and less populous districts were left to struggle to
maintain their schools the four months each year necessary to secure state
aid. Finally, after much agitation, and a number of appeals to the
legislature to assume the rate-bill charges in the form of general state
taxation, and thus make the schools entirely free, the legislature, in
1849, referred the matter back to the people to be voted on at the
elections that autumn. The legislature was to be thus advised by the
people as to what action it should take. The result was a state-wide
campaign for free, public, tax-supported schools, as against partially
free, rate-bill schools.

The result of the 1849 election was a vote of 249,872 in favor of making
"the property of the State educate the children of the State," and 91,952
against it. This only seemed to stir the opponents of free schools to
renewed action, and they induced the next legislature to resubmit the
question for another vote, in the autumn of 1850.

The result of the referendum of 1850 is shown on the map on page 685. The
opponents of tax-supported schools now mustered their full strength,
doubling their vote in 1849, while the majority for free schools was
materially cut down. The interesting thing shown on this map was the clear
and unmistakable voice of the cities. They would not tolerate the rate-
bill, and, despite their larger property interests, they favored tax-
supported free schools. The rural districts, on the other hand, opposed
the idea.

THE RATE-BILL IN OTHER STATES. These two referenda virtually settled the
question in New York, though for a time a compromise was adopted. The
state appropriation for schools was very materially increased, the rate-
bill was retained, and the organization of "union districts" to provide
free schools by local taxation where people desired them was authorized.
Many of these "union free districts" now arose in the more progressive
communities of the State, and finally, in 1867, after rural and other
forms of opposition had largely subsided, and after almost all the older
States had abandoned the plan, the New York legislature finally abolished
the rate-bill and made the schools of New York entirely free.

The dates for the abolition of the rate-bill in the other older Northern
States were:

    1834. Pennsylvania.    1867. New York.
    1852. Indiana.         1868. Connecticut.
    1853. Ohio.            1868. Rhode Island.
    1855. Illinois.        1869. Michigan.
    1864. Vermont.         1871. New Jersey.

The New York fight of 1849 and 1850 was the pivotal fight; in the other
States it was abandoned by legislative act, and without a serious contest.
In the Southern States free education came with the educational
reorganizations following the close of the Civil War.


IV. THE BATTLE TO ESTABLISH SCHOOL SUPERVISION

BEGINNINGS OF STATE CONTROL. The great battle for state schools was not
only for taxation to stimulate their development where none existed, but
was also indirectly a battle for some form of state control of the local
systems which had already grown up. The establishment of permanent state
school funds by the older States, to supplement any other aid which might
be granted, also tended toward the establishment of some form of state
supervision and control of the local school systems. The first step was
the establishment of some form of state aid; the next was the imposing of
conditions necessary to secure this state aid.

State oversight and control, however, does not exercise itself, and it
soon became evident that the States must elect or appoint some officer to
represent the State and enforce the observance of its demands. It would be
primarily his duty to see that the laws relating to schools were carried
out, that statistics as to existing conditions were collected and printed,
and that communities were properly advised as to their duties and the
legislature as to the needs of the State. We find now the creation of a
series of school officers to represent the State, the enactment of new
laws extending control, and a struggle to integrate, subordinate, and
reduce to some semblance of a state school system the hundreds of little
community school systems which had grown up.

THE FIRST STATE SCHOOL OFFICERS. The first American State to create a
state officer to exercise supervision over its schools was New York, in
1812. In enacting the new law [8] providing for state aid for schools the
first State Superintendent of Common Schools in the United States was
created. So far as is known this was a distinctively American creation,
uninfluenced by the practice in any other land. It was to be the duty of
this officer to look after the establishment and maintenance of the
schools throughout the State. [9] Maryland created the office in 1826, but
two years later abolished it and did not re-create it until 1864. Illinois
directed its Secretary of State to act, _ex officio_, as Superintendent of
Schools in 1825, as did also Vermont in 1827, Louisiana in 1833,
Pennsylvania in 1834, and Tennessee in 1835. Illinois did not create a
real State Superintendent of Schools, though, until 1854, Vermont until
1845, Louisiana until 1847, Pennsylvania until 1857, or Tennessee until
1867. The first States to create separate school officials who have been
continued to the present time were Michigan and Kentucky, both in 1837.
Often quite a legislative struggle took place to secure the establishment
of the office, and later on to prevent its abolition.

[Illustration: FIG. 203. STATUS OF SCHOOL SUPERVISION IN THE UNITED STATES
BY 1861
For a list of the 28 City Superintendencies established up to 1870, see
Cubberley's _Public School Administration_, p. 58. For the history of the
state educational office in each State see Cubberley and Elliott, _State
and County School Administration, Source Book_, pp. 283-87.]

By 1850 there were _ex-officio_ state school officers in nine and regular
school officers in seven of the then thirty-one States, and by 1861 there
were _ex-officio_ officers in nine and regular officers in nineteen of the
then thirty-four States, as well as one of each in two of the organized
Territories. The above map shows the growth of supervisory oversight by
1861--forty-nine years from the time the first American state school
officer was created. The map also shows the ten of the thirty-four States
which had, by 1861, also created the office of County Superintendent of
Schools, as well as the twenty-five cities which had, by 1861, created the
office of City Superintendent of Schools. Only three more cities--Albany,
Washington, and Kansas City--were added before 1870, making a total of
twenty-eight, but since that date the number of city superintendents has
increased to something like fourteen hundred to-day.

THE FIRST STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. Another important form for state
control which was created a little later was the State Board of Education,
with an appointed Secretary, who exercised about the same functions as a
State Superintendent of Schools. This form of organization first arose in
Massachusetts, in 1837, in an effort to subordinate the district schools
and reduce them to a semblance of an organized system. "Well go along and
get them." Off I started; but, before I had run fifty feet, he called me
back. "Stop," said he; "you go on getting the grain in. When we get
off, I'll lay to over opposite that island, and send a boat back. There's
a lot of regular nigger-catchers in the town below, and they might suspect
if you brought your party out of the bush by daylight." I worked away with
a will. Soon the two or three hundred bushels of corn were aboard,
the hatches fastened down, the anchor raised, and the sails hoisted.
I watched the vessel with intense interest as she left her moorings. Away
she went before the free breeze. Already she seemed beyond the spot
at which the captain agreed to lay to, and still she flew along. My heart
sank within me; so near deliverance, and again to have my hopes blasted,
again to be cast on my own resources. I felt that they had been making a
mock of my misery. The sun had sunk to rest, and the purple and gold of
the west were fading away into gray.

Suddenly, however, as I gazed with weary heart the vessel swung round into
the wind, the sails flapped, and she stood motionless. A moment more, and
a boat was lowered from her stern, and with steady stroke made for the point
at which I stood. I felt that my hour of release had come. On she came, and
in ten minutes she rode up handsomely on the beach. My black friend and
two sailors jumped out, and we started on at once for my wife and children.
To my horror, they were gone from the place where I left them. Overpowered
with fear, I supposed they had been found and carried off. There was
no time to lose, and the men told me I would have to go alone.
Just at the point of despair, however, I stumbled on one of the
children. My wife it seemed, alarmed at my long absence, had given up
all for lost, and supposed I had fallen into the hands of the
enemy. When she heard my voice, mingled with those of the others, she
thought my captors were leading me back to make me discover my
family, and in the extremity of her terror she had tried to hide herself.
I had hard work to satisfy her. Our long habits of concealment and anxiety
had rendered her suspicious of every one; and her agitation was so
great that for a time she was incapable of understanding what I said,
and went on in a sort of paroxysm of distress and fear.

This, however, was soon over, and the kindness of my companions did much
to facilitate the matter."--Father Henson's Story of his own Life, p.
121.

[5] Henson, "_Uncle Tom's Story of his Life_," p. 162.
[6] Years thereafter when taking dinner with a distinguished gentleman
in London the thought of enjoying such privileges while his only
brother was in slavery dawned suddenly and impressed itself so
forcefully upon him that he immediately arose from the table, unable
to eat.No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people
the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, and
free, and that its aim should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and
character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.
Under his practical leadership an unorganized and heterogeneous series of
community school systems was reduced to organization and welded together
into a state school system, and the people of Massachusetts were
effectively recalled to their ancient belief in and duty toward the
education of the people.

HENRY BARNARD IN CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND. Almost equally important,
though of a somewhat different character, was the work of Henry Barnard
(1811-1900) in Connecticut and Rhode Island. A graduate of Yale, and also
educated for the law, he turned aside to teach and became deeply
interested in education. The years 1835-37 he spent in Europe studying
schools, particularly the work of Pestalozzi's disciples. On his return to
America he was elected a member of the Connecticut legislature, and at
once formulated and secured passage of the Connecticut law (1839)
providing for a State Board of Commissioners for Common Schools, with a
Secretary, after the Massachusetts plan. Mr. Barnard was then elected as
its first Secretary, and reluctantly gave up the law and accepted the
position at the munificent salary of $3 a day and expenses. Until the
legislature abolished both the Board and the position, in 1842, he
rendered for Connecticut a service scarcely less important than the
better-known reforms which Horace Mann was at that time carrying on in
Massachusetts.

UNITED STATES.

HORACE MANN (1796-1859)
(From the painting at the Westfield, Massachusetts, Normal School)

HENRY BARNARD (1811-1900)]

In 1843 he was called to Rhode Island to examine and report upon the
existing schools, and from 1845 to 1849 acted as State Commissioner of
Public Schools there, where he rendered a service similar to that
previously rendered in Connecticut. In addition he organized a series of
town libraries throughout the State. For his teachers' institutes he
devised a traveling model school, to give demonstration lessons in the art
of teaching. From 1851 to 1855 he was again in Connecticut, as principal
of the newly established state normal school and _ex-officio_ Secretary of
the Connecticut State Board of Education. He now rewrote the school laws,
increased taxation for schools, checked the power of the districts, there
known as "school societies," and laid the foundations of a state system of
schools. The work of Mann and Barnard had its influence throughout all the
Northern States, and encouraged the friends of education everywhere.
Almost contemporaneous with them were leaders in other States who helped
fight through the battles of state establishment and state organization
and control, and the period of their labors has since been termed the
period of the "great awakening."


V. THE BATTLE TO ELIMINATE SECTARIANISM

THE SECULARIZATION OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. The Church, it will be
remembered, was from the earliest colonial times in possession of the
education of the young. Not only were the earliest schools controlled by
the Church and dominated by the religious motive, but the right of the
Church to dictate the teaching in the schools was clearly recognized by
the State. Still more, the State looked to the Church to provide the
necessary education, and assisted it in doing so by donations of land and
money. The minister, as a town official, naturally examined the teachers
and the instruction in the schools. After the establishment of the
National Government this relationship for a time continued. [10] New York
and the New England States specifically set aside lands to help both
church and school. After about 1800 these land endowments for religion
ceased, but grants of state aid for religious schools continued for nearly
a half-century longer. Then it became common for a town or city to build a
schoolhouse from city taxation, and let it out rent-free to any
responsible person who would conduct a tuition school in it, with a few
free places for selected poor children. Still later, with the rise of the
state schools, it became quite common to take over church and private
schools and aid them on the same basis as the new state schools.

In colonial times, too, and for some decades into our national period, the
warmest advocates of the establishment of schools were those who had in
view the needs of the Church. Then gradually the emphasis shifted to the
needs of the State, and a new class of advocates of public education now
arose. If but a solitary voice Should say "These verses polyglot Are not
so bad," I should rejoice; But oh, my publishers would not!
* * * * * And I, though shy and unanointed, Should be a little
disappointed._

The local right to
demand religious instruction was insisted upon.

Mr. Mann felt that a great public issue had been raised which should be
answered carefully and fully. In three public statements he answered the
criticisms and pointed out the errors in the argument (R. 322). The Bible,
he said, was an invaluable book for forming the character of children, and
should be read without comment in the schools, but it was not necessary to
teach it there. He showed that most of the towns had given up the teaching
of the Catechism before the establishment of the Board of Education. He
contended that any attempt to decide what creed or doctrine should be
taught would mean the ruin of the schools. The attack culminated in the
attempts of the religious forces to abolish the State Board of Education,
in the legislatures of 1840 and 1841, which failed dismally. Most of the
orthodox people of the State took Mr. Mann's side, and Governor Briggs, in
one of his messages, commended his stand by inserting the following:

    Justice to a faithful public officer leads me to say that the
    indefatigable and accomplished Secretary of the Board of Education has
    performed services in the cause of common schools which will earn him
    the lasting gratitude of the generation to which he belongs.

THE ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE THE SCHOOL FUNDS. As was stated earlier, in the
beginning it was common to aid church schools on the same basis as the
state schools, and sometimes, in the beginnings of state aid, the money
was distributed among existing schools without at first establishing any
public schools. In many Eastern cities church schools at first shared in
the public funds. In Pennsylvania church and private schools were aided
from poor-law funds up to 1834. In New Jersey the first general school law
of 1829 had been repealed a year later through the united efforts of
church and private-school interests, who unitedly fought the development
of state schools, and in 1830 and 1831 new laws had permitted all private
and parochial schools to share in the small state appropriation for
education.

After the beginning of the forties, when the Roman Catholic influence came
in strongly with the increase in Irish immigration to the United States, a
new factor was introduced and the problem, which had previously been a
Protestant problem, took on a somewhat different aspect in the form of a
demand for a division of the school funds. Between 1825 and 1842 the fight
was especially severe in New York City. In 1825 the City Council refused
to grant public money to any religious Society, [11] and in 1840 the
Catholics carried the matter to the State Legislature.

The legislature deferred action until 1842, and then did the unexpected
thing. The heated discussion of the question in the city and in the
legislature had made it evident that, while it might not be desirable to
continue to give funds to a privately organized corporation, to divide
them among the quarreling and envious religious sects would be much worse.
The result was that the legislature created for the city a City Board of
Education, to establish real public schools, and stopped the debate on the
question of aid to religious schools by enacting that no portion of the
school funds was in the future to be given to any school in which "any
religious sectarian doctrine or tenet should be taught, inculcated, or
practiced." Thus the real public-school system of New York City was
evolved out of this attempt to divide the public funds among the churches.
The Public School Society continued for a time, but its work was now done,
and, in 1853, surrendered its buildings and property to the City Board of
Education and disbanded.

THE CONTEST IN OTHER STATES. As early as 1830, Lowell, Massachusetts, had
granted aid to the Irish Catholic parochial schools in the city, and in
1835 had taken over two such schools and maintained them as public
schools. In 1853 the representatives of the Roman Catholic Church made a
demand on the state legislature for a division of the school fund of the
State. To settle the question once for all a constitutional amendment was
submitted by the legislature to the people, providing that all state and
town moneys raised or appropriated for education must be expended only on
regularly organized and conducted public schools, and that no religious
sect should ever share in such funds. This measure failed of adoption at
the election of 1853 by a vote of 65,111 for and 65,512 against, but was
re-proposed and adopted in 1855. This settled the question in
Massachusetts, as Mann had tried to settle it earlier, and as New
Hampshire had settled it in its constitution of 1792, Connecticut in its
constitution of 1818, and Rhode Island in its constitution of 1842.

Other States now faced similar demands, but no demand for a share in or a
division of the public-school funds, after 1840, was successful. The
demand everywhere met with intense opposition, and with the coming of
enormous numbers of Irish Catholics after 1846, and German Lutherans after
1848, the question of the preservation of the schools just established as
unified state school systems now became a burning one. Petitions for a
division of the funds deluged the legislatures (R. 323), and these were
met by counter-petitions (R. 324). Mass meetings on both sides of the
question were held. Candidates for office were forced to declare
themselves. Anti-Catholic riots occurred in a number of cities. The
Native-American Party was formed, in 1841, "to prevent the union of Church
and State," and to "keep the Bible in the schools." In 1841 the Whig
Party, in New York, inserted a plank in its platform against sectarian
schools. In 1855 the national council of the Know-Nothing Party, meeting
in Philadelphia, in its platform favored public schools and the use of the
Bible therein, but opposed sectarian schools. This party carried the
elections that year in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Maryland, and Kentucky.

To settle the question in a final manner legislatures now began to propose
constitutional amendments to the people of their several States which
forbade a division or a diversion of the funds, and these were almost
uniformly adopted at the first election after being proposed. No State
admitted to the Union after 1858, except West Virginia, failed to insert
such a provision in its first state constitution. [12]

VI.
THE BATTLE TO ESTABLISH THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL

The elementary or common schools which had been established in the
different States, by 1850, supplied an elementary or common school
education to the children of the masses of the people, and the primary
schools which were added, after about 1820, carried this education
downward to the needs of the beginners. In the rural schools the American
school of the 3 Rs provided for all the children, from the little ones up,
so long as they could advantageously partake of its instruction. Education
in advance of this common school training was in semi-private
institutions--the academies and colleges--in which a tuition fee was
charged. The next struggle came in the attempt to extend the system upward
so as to provide to pupils, free of charge, a more complete education than
the common schools afforded.

[Illustration: FIG. 204. A TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND ACADEMY
Pittsfield Academy, New Hampshire.]

THE TRANSITION ACADEMY. About the middle of the eighteenth century a
tendency manifested itself, in Europe as well as in America, to establish
higher schools offering a more practical curriculum than the old Latin
schools had provided. In America it became particularly evident, after the
coming of nationality, that the old Latin grammar-school type of
instruction, with its limited curriculum and exclusively college-
preparatory ends, was wholly inadequate for the needs of the youth of the
land. "Perhaps it may be," said one of the mothers, Who seemed more
considerate and wise than the others, "Perhaps," said she, trembling at
even the thought, "We give our dear young ones less food than we
ought; We may be impatient; I have really some fears That we rock
them too little, the poor little dears; Our milk may cause fever,
and their stomachs not suit, Or perhaps they are weakened and injured
by fruit.

Perhaps the whole mischief is caused by the air, And who 'gainst
this evil can ever prepare?
In their earliest years, it may poison instil, And through their whole
lifetime produce every ill.
Perhaps it may be, before we are aware, They breathe in a pestilence, borne
on the air.
Perhaps, for the nerves of us monkeys are weak, In jumping, or leaping,
some bone they may break In their breasts." Here, for weeping, she
scarcely could speak, And she snatched up her little one long to
her breast; With such vehement love the poor victim she pressed,
That all its complainings and troubles were stilled; Alas the poor
mother!

her pet she had killed.

Said the bear,--"No longer I think you need seek For the cause why
your young ones are sickly and weak; It is not the milk, nor the
fruit, nor the air, Nor fault of the stomach, and 'tis no lack of
care.

Your blind fondness it is that cuts short their days.
How is it that we such multitudes raise?
As soon as our young ones are able to run, We take them out with us to
play in the sun.
We take them through floods, through heat, and through cold, And so they
are healthy, and live to be old."

NOTICES OF THE PRESS.

"A more interesting and instructive biographical work we have never
read. High as was our opinion of Channing,--of his intellectual and
moral worth,--the perusal of this work has convinced us that we
never duly estimated him.... His letters reveal his character more
fully than his sermons and essays. In his letters he lays his heart
entirely open; and no man, no matter what his opinions or prejudices,
can read them without saying,--'Channing was, indeed, a great and
good man,--one who lived for the world!'"--_Christian Messenger._

"Only one who was similar in purpose and temper,--who felt like
aspirations, hopes, and faith,--could at all do justice to the
distinguished subject. The present book must, therefore, we are
sure, give us Channing's character in its completeness, and true
harmony and proportions of parts."--_Salem Observer._
"These memoirs of a great and good man will, we apprehend, obtain
an uncommonly extensive circulation, not only among the denomination
of Christians in which he ranked himself, but with all who reverence
purity of character, an enlarged philanthropy, and eminent talents,
guided by virtue and piety."--_Salem Register._
"If we mistake not, now is the very time in God's providence when
the biography of William Ellery Channing could best make its
appearance.
We have heard that a distinguished divine, of different speculative
religious views from Dr.The settlement of
the question of general taxation for education, the elimination of the
rate-bill by the cities and later by the States, the establishment of the
American common school as the result of a long native evolution, and the
complete establishment of public control over the entire elementary-school
system, all tended to bring the semi-private tuition academy into
question. Many asked why not extend the public-school system upward to
provide the necessary higher education for all in one common state-
supported school. [15]

The demand for an upward extension of the public school, which would
provide academy instruction for the poor as well as the rich, and in one
common public higher school, now made itself felt. As the colonial Latin
grammar school had represented the educational needs of a society based on
classes, and the academies had represented a transition period and marked
the growth of a middle class, so the rising democracy of the second
quarter of the nineteenth century now demanded and obtained the democratic
high school, supported by the public and equally open to all, to meet the
educational needs of a new society built on the basis of a new and
aggressive democracy. Where, too, the academy had represented in a way a
missionary effort--that of a few providing something for the good of the
people (Rs. 319, 325)--the high school on the other hand represented a
coöperative effort on the part of the people to provide something for
themselves.

[Illustration: FIG. 205. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE
UNITED STATES
The transitional character of the Academy is well shown in this diagram.]

THE FIRST AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL. The first high school in the United States
was established in Boston, in 1821 (R. 326). For three years it was known
as the "English Classical School"  (R. 327), but in 1824 the school
appears in the records as the "English High School." In 1826 Boston also
opened the first high school for girls, but abolished it in 1828, due to
its great popularity, and instead extended the course of study for girls
in the elementary schools.

[Illustration: FIG. 206 THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES
Established at Boston in 1821.]

THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW OF 1827. Though Portland, Maine, established a high
school in 1821, Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1824, and New Bedford,
Haverhill, and Salem, Massachusetts, in 1827, copying the Boston idea, the
real beginning of the American high school as a distinct institution dates
from the Massachusetts Law of 1827 (R. 328), enacted through the influence
of James G. Carter. This law formed the basis of all subsequent
legislation in Massachusetts, and deeply influenced development in other
States. The law is significant in that it required a high school in every
town having 500 families or over, in which should be taught United States
history, bookkeeping, algebra, geometry, and surveying, while in every
town having 4000 inhabitants or over, instruction in Greek, Latin,
history, rhetoric, and logic must be added. A heavy penalty was attached
for failure to comply with the law. In 1835 the law was amended so as to
permit any smaller town to form a high school as well.

This Boston and Massachusetts legislation clearly initiated the public
high-school movement in the United States. It was there that the new type
of higher school was founded, there that its curriculum was outlined,
there that its standards were established, and there that it developed
earliest and best.

THE STRUGGLE TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN HIGH SCHOOLS. The development of
the American high school, even in its home, was slow. Up to 1840 not much
more than a dozen high schools had been established in Massachusetts, and
not more than an equal number in the other States. The Academy was the
dominant institution, the cost of maintenance was a factor, and the same
opposition to an extension of taxation to include high schools was
manifested as was earlier shown toward the establishment of common
schools. The early state legislation, as had been the case with the common
schools, was nearly always permissive and not mandatory. Massachusetts
forms a notable exception in this regard.  The support for the schools had
to come practically entirely from increased local taxation, and this made
the struggle to establish and maintain high schools in any State for a
long time a series of local struggles. Years of propaganda and patient
effort were required, and, after the establishment of a high school in a
community, constant watchfulness was necessary to prevent its abandonment
(R. 329).

[Illustration: FIG. 207. HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES BY 1860
Based on the table given in the _Report of the United States Commissioner
of Education_, 1904, vol. II, pp. 1782-1989. This table is only
approximately correct, as exact information is difficult to obtain. This
table gives 321 high schools by 1860, and all but 35 of these were in the
States shown on the above map. There were two schools in California and
three in Texas, and the remainder not shown were in the Southern States.
Of the 321 high schools reported, over half (167) were in the three States
of Massachusetts (78), New York (41), and Ohio (48).]

In many States, legislation providing for the establishment of high
schools was attacked in the courts. One of the clearest cases of this came
in Michigan, in a test case appealed from the city of Kalamazoo, and
commonly known as the Kalamazoo case. The opinion of the Supreme Court of
the State (R. 330) was so favorable and so positive that this decision
deeply influenced development in almost all of the Upper Mississippi
Valley States. The struggle to establish and maintain high schools in
Massachusetts and New York preceded the development in most other States,
because there the common school had been established earlier. In
consequence, the struggle to extend and complete the public-school system
came there earlier also. The development was likewise more peaceful there,
and came more rapidly. In Massachusetts this was in large part a result of
the educational awakening started by James G. Carter and Horace Mann. In
New York it was due to the early support of Governor De Witt Clinton, and
the later encouragement and state aid which came from the Regents of the
University of the State of New York. Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire
were like Massachusetts in spirit, and followed closely its example. In
Rhode Island and New Jersey, due to old conditions, and in Connecticut,
due to the great decline in education there after 1800, the high school
developed much more slowly, and it was not until after 1865 that any
marked development took place in these States. The democratic West soon
adopted the idea, and established high schools as soon as cities developed
and the needs of the population warranted. In the South the main high-
school development dates from relatively recent times.

Gradually the high school has been accepted as a part of the state common-
school system by all the American States, and the funds and taxation
originally provided for the common schools have been extended to cover the
high school as well. The new States of the West have based their
legislation largely on what the Eastern and Central States earlier fought
out.


VII. THE STATE UNIVERSITY CROWNS THE SYSTEM

THE COLONIAL COLLEGES. The earlier colleges--Harvard, William and Mary,
Yale--had been created by the religious-state governments of the earlier
colonial period, and continued to retain some state connections for a time
after the coming of nationality. As it early became evident that a
democracy demands intelligence on the part of its citizens, that the
leaders of democracy are not likely to be too highly educated, and that
the character of collegiate instruction must ultimately influence national
development, efforts were accordingly made to change the old colleges or
create new ones, the final outcome of which was the creation of state
universities in all the new and in most of the older States. The evolution
of the state university, as the crowning head of the free public school
system of the State, represents the last phase which we shall trace of the
struggle of democracy to create a system of schools suited to its peculiar
needs.

The close of the colonial period found the Colonies possessed of nine
colleges. These, with the dates of their foundation, the Colony founding
them, and the religious denomination they chiefly represented were:

    1636.     Harvard College           Massachusetts   Puritan
    1693.     William and Mary          Virginia        Anglican
    1701.     Yale College              Connecticut     Congregational
    1746.     Princeton                 New Jersey      Presbyterian
    1753-55   Academy and College       Pennsylvania    Non-denominational
    1754.     King's College (Columbia) New York        Anglican
    1764.     Brown                     Rhode Island    Baptist
    1765.     Rutgers                   New Jersey      Reformed Dutch
    1769.     Dartmouth                 New Hampshire   Congregational

The religious purpose had been dominant in the founding of each
institution, though there was a gradual shading-off in strict
denominational control and insistence upon religious conformity in the
foundations after 1750. Still the prime purpose in the founding of each
was to train up a learned and godly body of ministers, the earlier
congregations at least "dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the
churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust." In a pamphlet,
published in 1754, President Clap of Yale declared that "Colleges are
_Societies of Ministers_, for training up Persons for the Work of the
_Ministry_" and that "The great design of founding this School (Yale), was
to Educate Ministers in our _own Way_." In the advertisement published in
the New York papers announcing the opening of King's College, in 1754, it
was stated that:

    IV. The chief Thing that is aimed at in this College, is, to teach and
    engage the Children _to know God in Jesus Christ_, and to love
    and serve him in all _Sobriety, Godliness_, and _Richness of
    Life_, with a perfect Heart and a Willing Mind: and to train them
    up in all Virtuous Habits, and all such useful Knowledge as may render
    them creditable to their Families and Friends, Ornaments to their
    Country, and useful to the Public Weal in their generation.

These colonial institutions were all small. For the first fifty years of
Harvard's history the attendance at the college seldom exceeded twenty,
and the President did all the teaching. The first assistant teacher
(tutor) was not appointed until 1699, and the first professor not until
1721, when a professorship of divinity was endowed. By 1800 the
instruction was conducted by the President and three professors--divinity,
mathematics, and "Oriental languages"--assisted by a few tutors who
received only class fees, and the graduating classes seldom exceeded
forty. The course was four years in length, and all students studied the
same subjects. The first three years were given largely to the so-called
"Oriental languages"  Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. In addition, Freshmen
studied arithmetic; Sophomores, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry; and
Juniors, natural (book) science; and all were given much training in
oratory, and some general history was added. The Senior year was given
mainly to ethics, philosophy, and Christian evidences. [16] The
instruction in the eight other older colleges, before 1800, was not
materially different.

[Illustration: FIG. 208. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ESTABLISHED BY 1860
Compiled from data given in the _Reports of the United States Commissioner
of Education_. Of the 246 colleges shown on the map, but 17 were state
institutions, and but two or three others had any state connections.]

GROWTH OF COLLEGES BY 1860. Fifteen additional colleges were founded
before 1800, and it has been estimated that by that date the two dozen
American colleges then existing did not have all told over one hundred
professors and instructors, not less than one thousand nor more than two
thousand students, or property worth over one million dollars. Their
graduating classes were small.  No one of the twenty-four admitted women
in any way to its privileges.  After 1820, with the firmer establishment
of the Nation, the awakening of a new national consciousness, the
development of larger national wealth, and a court decision which
safeguarded the endowments, interest in the founding of new colleges
perceptibly quickened, as may be seen from the adjoining table, and
between 1820 and 1880 came the great period of denominational effort. The
map shows the colleges established by 1860, from which it will be seen how
large a part the denominational colleges played in the early history of
higher education in the United States. Up to about 1870 the provision of
higher education, as had been the case earlier with the provision of
secondary education by the academies, had been left largely to private
effort. There were, to be sure, a few state universities before 1870,
though usually these were not better than the denominational colleges
around them, and often they maintained a non-denominational character only
by preserving a proper balance between the different denominations in the
employment of their faculties. Speaking generally, higher education in the
United States before 1870 was provided very largely in the tuitional
colleges of the different religious denominations, rather than by the
State. Of the 246 colleges founded by the close of the year 1860, as shown
on the map, but 17 were state institutions, and but two or three others
had any state connections.

    Total           494

    (After a table by Dexter corrected by U.S. Comr. Educ. data. Only
    approximately correct.)

THE NEW NATIONAL ATTITUDE TOWARD THE COLLEGES. After the coming of
nationality there gradually grew up a widespread dissatisfaction with the
colleges as then conducted, because they were aristocratic in tendency,
because they devoted themselves so exclusively to the needs of a class,
and because they failed to answer the needs of the States in the matter of
higher education. Due to their religious origin, and the common
requirement that the president and trustees must be members of some
particular denomination, they were naturally regarded as representing the
interests of some one sect or faction within the State rather than the
interests of the State itself. With the rise of the new democratic spirit
after about 1820 there came a  demand, felt least in New England and most
in the South and the new States in the West, for institutions of higher
learning which should represent the State. It was argued that colleges
were important instrumentalities for moulding the future, that the kind of
education given in them must ultimately influence the welfare of the
State, and that higher education cannot be regarded as a private matter.
The type of education given in these higher institutions, it was argued,
"will appear on the bench, at the bar, in the pulpit, and in the senate,
and will unavoidably affect our civil and religious principles." For these
reasons, as well as to crown our state school system and to provide higher
educational advantages for its leaders, it was argued that the State
should exercise control over the colleges.

This new national spirit manifested itself in a number of ways. In New
York we see it in the reorganization of King's College, the rechristening
of the institution as Columbia, and the placing of it under at least the
nominal supervision of the governing educational body of the State. In
Pennsylvania an attempt was made to bring the university into closer
connection with the State, but this failed. In New Hampshire the
legislature tried, in 1816, to transform Dartmouth College into a state
institution. This act was contested in the courts, and the case was
finally carried to the Supreme Court of the United States. There it was
decided, in 1819, that the charter of a college was a contract, the
obligation of which a legislature could not impair.

EFFECT OF THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE DECISION. The effect of this decision
manifested itself in two different ways. On the one hand it guaranteed the
perpetuity of endowments, and the great period of private and
denominational effort (see table) now followed. On the other hand, since
the States could not change charters and transform old establishments,
they began to turn to the creation of new state universities of their own.
Virginia created its state university the same year as the Dartmouth case
decision. The University of North Carolina, which had been established in
1789, and which began to give instruction in 1795, but which had never
been under direct state control, was taken over by the State in 1821. The
University of Vermont, originally chartered in 1791, was rechartered as a
state university in 1838. The University of Indiana was established in
1820. Alabama provided for a state university in its first constitution,
in 1819, and the institution opened for instruction in 1831. Michigan, in
framing its first constitution preparatory to entering the Union, in 1835,
made careful provisions for the safeguarding of the state university and
for establishing it as an integral part of its state school system, as
Indiana had done in 1816. Wisconsin provided for the creation of a state
university in 1836, and embodied the idea in its first constitution when
it entered the Union in 1848, and Missouri provided for a state university
in 1839, Mississippi in 1844, Iowa in 1847, and Florida in 1856. The state
university is today found in every "new" State and in some of the
"original" States, and practically every new Western and Southern State
followed the patterns set by Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin and made
careful provision for the establishment and maintenance of a state
university in its first state constitution.

There was thus quietly added another new section to the American
educational ladder, and the free public-school system was extended farther
upward. Though the great period of state university foundation came after
1860, and the great period of state university expansion after 1885, the
beginnings were clearly marked early in our national history. Of the
sixteen States having state universities by 1860 (see Figure 208), all
except Florida had established them before 1850. For a long time small,
poorly supported by the States, much like the church colleges about them
in character and often inferior in quality, one by one the state
universities have freed themselves alike from denominational restrictions
on the one hand and political control on the other, and have set about
rendering the service to the State which a state university ought to
render. Michigan, the first of our state universities to free itself, take
its proper place, and set an example for others to follow, opened in 1841
with two professors and six students. In 1844 it was a little institution
of three professors, one tutor, one assistant, and one visiting lecturer,
had but fifty-three students, and offered but a single course of study,
consisting chiefly of Greek, Latin, mathematics, and intellectual and
moral science (R. 331). As late as 1852 it had but seventy-two students,
but by 1860, when it had largely freed itself from the incubus of Baptist
Latin, Congregational Greek, Methodist intellectual philosophy,
Presbyterian astronomy, and Whig mathematics, and its remarkable growth as
a state university had begun, it enrolled five hundred and nineteen.

THE AMERICAN FREE PUBLIC-SCHOOL SYSTEM NOW ESTABLISHED. By the close of
the second quarter of the nineteenth century, certainly by 1860, we find
the American public-school system fully established, in principle at
least, in all our Northern States (R. 332). Much yet remained to be done
to carry into full effect what had been established in principle, but
everywhere democracy had won its fight, and the American public school,
supported by general taxation, freed from the pauper-school taint, free
and equally open to all, under the direction of representatives of the
people, free from sectarian control, and complete from the primary school
through the high school, and in the Western States through the university
as well, was established permanently in American public policy. It was a
real democratic educational ladder that had been created, and not the
typical two-class school system of continental European States. The
establishment of the free public high school and the state university
represent the crowning achievements of those who struggled to found a
state-supported educational system fitted to the needs of great democratic
States. Probably no other influences have done more to unify the American
People, reconcile diverse points of view, eliminate state jealousies, set
ideals for the people, and train leaders for the service of the States and
of the Nation than the academies, high schools, and colleges scattered
over the land. They have educated but a small percentage of the people, to
be sure, but they have trained most of the leaders who have guided the
American democracy since its birth.

American school system will be apparent.]

CHAPTER XXVII

EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL


I. SPREAD OF THE STATE-CONTROL IDEA

THE FIVE TYPE NATIONS. We have now traced, in some detail, the struggles
of forward-looking men to establish national systems of education in five
great world nations. In each we have described the steps by means of which
the State gradually superseded the Church in the control of education, and
the motives and impulses which finally led the State to take over the
school as a function of the State. The steps and impelling motives and
rate of transfer were not the same in any two nations, but in each of the
five the political necessities of the State in time made the transfer seem
desirable. Time everywhere was required to effect the change. The movement
began earliest and was concluded earliest in the German States, and was
concluded last in England. In the German States, France, and Italy the
change came rapidly and as a result of legislative acts or imperial
decrees. In England and the United States the transfer took place, as we
have seen, only in response to the slow development of public opinion.

This change in control and extension of educational advantages was
essentially a nineteenth-century movement, and a resultant of the new
political philosophy and the democratic revolutions of the later
eighteenth century, combined with the industrial revolution of the
nineteenth century. A new political impulse now replaced the earlier
religious motive as the incentive for education, and education for
literacy and citizenship became, during the nineteenth century, a new
political ideal that has, in time, spread to progressive nations all over
the world.

The five great nations whose educational evolution has been described in
the preceding chapters may be regarded as having formed types which have
since been copied, in more or less detail, by the more progressive nations
in different parts of the world. The continental European two-class school
system, the American educational ladder, and the English tendency to
combine the two and use the best parts of each, have been reproduced in
the different national educational systems which have been created by the
various political governments of the world. The continental European idea
of a centralized ministry for education, with an appointed head or a
cabinet minister in control, has also been widely copied. The Prussian
two-class plan has been most influential among the Teutonic and Slavic
peoples of Europe, and has also deeply influenced educational development
among the Japanese; English ideas have been extensively copied in the
English self-governing dominions; and the American plan has been clearly
influential in Canada, the Argentine, and in China. The French centralized
plan for organization and administration has been widely copied in the
state educational organizations of the Latin nations of Europe and South
America. In a general way it may be stated that the more democratic the
government of a nation has become the greater has been the tendency to
break away from the two-class school system, to introduce more of an
educational ladder, and to bring in more of the English conception of
granting to localities a reasonable amount of local liberty in educational
affairs.

SPREAD OF THE STATE CONTROL IDEA AMONG NORTHERN NATIONS. The development
of schools under the control of the government, and the extension of state
supervision to the existing religious schools, took place in the different
cantons of Switzerland, and in Holland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,
somewhat contemporaneously with the development described for the five
type nations. The work of Pestalozzi and Fellenberg, and of their
disciples and followers, had given an early impetus to the establishment
of schools and teacher-training in the Swiss cantons, most being done in
the German-speaking portions.

In Holland, where the Reformation zeal for schools largely died out in the
eighteenth century, the organization of the "Society of Public Good," in
1784, by a Mennonite clergyman, did much to awaken a new interest in
schools for the people and to inaugurate a new movement for educational
organization. In 1795 a revolution took place in Holland, a republic was
established, and the extension of educational advantages followed. From
1806 to 1815 Holland was under the rule of Napoleon. A school law of 1806
forms the basis of public education in Holland. This asserted the
supremacy of the State in education, and provided for state inspection of
schools. In 1812 the French scientist, M. Cuvier, reported to Napoleon
that there were 4451 schools in little Holland, and that one tenth of the
total population was in school. In 1816 a normal school was established at
Haarlem. Both the constitutions of 1815 and 1848 provided for state
control of education, which has been steadily extended since the beginning
of the revival in 1784. Today Holland provides a good system of public
instruction for its people.

[Illustration: Fig. 210. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF DENMARK]

In Denmark and Sweden the development of state schools has been worked
out, much as in England, in coöperation with the Church, and the Church
still assists the State in the administration and supervision of the
school systems which were eventually evolved. In each of these countries,
too, the continental two-class school system has been somewhat modified by
an upward movement of the transfer point between the two and the
development of people's high schools, so as to produce a more democratic
type of school and afford better educational opportunities to all classes
of the population. The annexed diagram, showing the organization of
education in Denmark, is typical of this modification and extension.

Finland should also be classed with these northern nations in matters of
educational development. Lutheran ideas as to religion and the need for
education took deep hold there at an early date (p. 297). A knowledge of
reading and the Catechism was made necessary for confirmation as early as
1686, and democratic ideas also found an early home among this people. In
consequence the Finns have for long been a literate people. The law making
elementary education a function of the State, however, dates only from
1866, and secondary education was taken over from the ecclesiastical
authorities only in 1872.

Similarly, Scotland, another northern nation, began schools as a phase of
its Reformation fervor. During the eighteenth century the parish schools,
created by the Acts of 1646 (R. 179; p. 335) and 1696, proved
insufficient, and voluntary schools were added to supplement them.
Together these insured for Scotland a much higher degree of literacy than
was the case in England. The final state organization of education in
Scotland dates from the Scottish Education Act of 1872.

[Illustration: FIG. 211. THE PROGRESS OF LITERACY IN EUROPE BY THE CLOSE
OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY]

The map reproduced here, showing the progress of general education by the
close of the nineteenth century, as measured by the spread of the ability
to read and write, reveals at a glance the high degree of literacy of the
northern Teutonic and mixed Teutonic nations. It was among these nations
that the Protestant Reformation ideas made the deepest impression; it was
in these northern States that the Protestant elementary vernacular school,
to teach reading and religion, attained its earliest start; it was there
that the school was taken over from the Church and erected into an
effective national instrument at an early date; and it was these nations
which had been most successful, by the close of the nineteenth century, in
extending the elements of education to all and thus producing literate
populations.

THE STATE-CONTROL IDEA IN THE SOUTH AND EAST OF EUROPE. As we pass to the
south and east of Europe we pass not only to lands which remained loyal to
the Roman Church, or are adherents of the Greek Church, and hence did not
experience the Reformation fervor with its accompanying zeal for
education, but also to lands untouched by the French-Revolution movement
and where democratic ideas have only recently begun to make any progress.
Greece alone forms an exception to this statement, a constitutional
government having been established there in 1843. Removed from the main
stream of European civilization, these nations have been influenced less
by modern forces; the hold of the Church on the education of the young has
there been longest retained; and the taking-over of education by the State
has there been longest deferred. In consequence, the schools provided have
for long been inadequate both in number and scope, and the progress of
literacy and democratic ideas among the people has been slow.

Despite the beginnings made by Maria Theresa (p. 475) in the late
eighteenth century, Austria dropped backward to a low place in matters of
education during the period of reaction following the Napoleonic wars, and
the real beginnings of state elementary-schools there date from the law of
1867. The beginnings in Hungary date from 1868. The beginnings of other
state elementary school systems are: Greece, 1823; Portugal, 1844; Spain,
1857; Roumania, 1859; Bulgaria, 1881; and Serbia, 1882. In many of these
States, despite early beginnings, but little real progress has even yet
been made in developing systems of national education that will provide
gratuitous elementary-school training for all and inculcate the national
spirit. In many of these States the illiteracy of the people is still
high, [1] the people are poor, the nations are economically backward, the
military and clerical classes still dominate, and intelligent and
interested governments have not as yet been evolved.

In Russia, though Catherine II and her successors made earnest efforts to
begin a system of state education, the period following Napoleon was one
of extreme repressive reaction. The military class and the clergy of the
Greek Church joined hands in a government interested in keeping the people
submissive and devout. In consequence, at the time of the emancipation of
the serfs, in 1861, it was estimated that not one per cent of the total
population of Russia was then under instruction, and the ratio of
illiteracy by the close of the nineteenth century was the highest in
Europe outside of Spain, Portugal, and the Balkan States.

THE STATE-CONTROL IDEA IN THE ENGLISH SELF-GOVERNING DOMINIONS. The
English and French settlers in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces
of Canada brought the English and French parochial-school ideas from their
home-lands with them, but these home conceptions were materially modified,
at an early date, by settlers from the northern States of the American
Union. These introduced the New England idea of state control and public
responsibility for education. In part copying precedents recently
established in the new American States, as an outcome of the struggles
there to establish free, tax-supported, and state-controlled schools, both
Ontario and Quebec early began the establishment of state systems of
education for their people. A superintendent of education was appointed in
Ontario in 1844, and the Common School Act of 1846 laid the foundation of
the state school system of the Province. In the law of 1871 a system of
uniform, free, compulsory, and state-inspected schools was definitely
provided for. Quebec, in 1845, made the ecclesiastical parish the unit for
school administration; in 1852 appointed government inspectors for the
church schools; and in 1859 provided for a Council of Public Instruction
to control all schools in the Province. The Dominion Act of 1867 left
education, as in the United States, to the several Provinces to control,
and state systems of education, though with large liberty in religious
instruction, or the incorporation of the religious schools into the state
school systems, have since been erected in all the Canadian Provinces.
Following American precedents, too, a thoroughly democratic educational
ladder has almost everywhere been created, substantially like that shown
in the Figure on page 708.

In Australia and New Zealand education has similarly been left to the
different States to handle, but a state centralized control has been
provided there which is more akin to French practice than to English
ideas. In each State, primary education has been made free, compulsory,
secular, and state-supported. The laws making such provision in the
different States date from 1872, in Victoria; 1875, in Queensland; 1878,
in South Australia, West Australia, and New Zealand; and 1880, in New
South Wales. Secondary education has not as yet been made free, and many
excellent privately endowed or fee-supported secondary schools, after the
English plan, are found in the different States.

In the new Union of South Africa all university education has been taken
over by the Union, while the existing school systems of the different
States are rapidly being taken over and expanded by the state governments,
and transformed into constructive instruments of the States.

THE STATE-CONTROL IDEA IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. As we have seen in
Chapter XX, the spirit of nationality awakened by the French Revolution
spread to South America, and between 1815 and 1821 all of Spain's South
American colonies revolted, declared their independence from the mother
country, and set up constitutional republics. Brazil, in 1822, in a
similar manner severed its connections from Portugal. The United States,
through the Monroe Doctrine (1823), helped these new States to maintain
their independence. For approximately half a century these States,
isolated as they were and engaged in a long and difficult struggle to
evolve stable forms of government, left such education as was provided to
private individuals and societies and to the missionaries and teaching
orders of the Roman Church. After the middle of the nineteenth century,
the new forces stirring in the modern world began to be felt in South
America as well, and, after about 1870, a well-defined movement to
establish state school systems began to be in evidence.

The Argentine constitution of 1853 had directed the establishment of
primary schools by the State, but nothing of importance was done until
after the election of Dr. Sarmiento as President, in 1868. Under his
influence an American-type normal school was established, teachers were
imported from the United States, and liberal appropriations for education
were begun. In 1873 a general system of national aid for primary education
was established, and in 1884 a new law laid the basis of the present state
school system. Though some earlier beginnings had been made in some of the
other South American nations, Argentine is regarded as the leader in
education among them. This is largely due to the democratic nature of the
government which, in connection with the deep interest in education of
President Sarmiento, [2] found educational expression in the creation of
an American-type educational ladder, as the accompanying diagram shows.
Large emphasis has been placed on scientific and practical studies in the
secondary _colegios_. The normal school has been given large importance,
and made a parallel and connecting link in the educational ladder between
the primary schools and the universities. The Argentine school system,
probably due to American influences acting through President Sarmiento,
forms an exception to the usual South American state school system, as
nearly all the other States have followed the French model and created a
European two-class school system.

[Illustration: FIG. 212. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC]

In Chili, the constitution of 1833 declared education to be of supreme
importance, and a normal school was established in Santiago, as early as
1840. The basic law for the organization of a state system of primary
instruction, however, dates from 1860, and the law organizing a state
system of secondary and higher education from 1872.

In Peru, an educational reform movement was inaugurated in 1876, but the
war with Chili (1879-84) checked all progress. In 1896 an Educational
Commission was appointed to visit the United States and Europe, and the
law of 1901 marked the creation of a ministry for education and the real
beginnings of a state school system.

The Brazilian constitution of 1824 left education to the several States
(twenty and one Federal District), and a permissive law of 1827 allowed
the different States to establish schools. It was not until 1854, however,
that public schools were organized in the Federal District, and these mark
the real beginning of state education in Brazil. Since then the
establishment of state schools has gradually extended to the coast States,
and inland with the building of railway lines and the opening-up of the
interior to outside influences. The basis for state-controlled education
has now been laid in all the States, but the attendance at the schools as
yet is small. [3]

In some of the other South American States, such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and
Venezuela, but little progress in extending state-controlled schools has
as yet been made, and the training of the young is still left largely to
private effort, the Church, and the religious orders. The illiteracy in
all the South American States is still high, in part due to the large
native populations, and much remains to be done before education becomes
general there. The state-control idea, though, has been definitely
established in principle in these countries. With the establishment of
stable governments, the building of railroads and steamship lines, and the
development of an important international commerce--events which there
have characterized the first two decades of the twentieth century--early
and important progress in state educational organization and in the
extension of educational advantages may be expected.

THE STATE-SCHOOL IDEA IN EASTERN ASIA. In 1854 Admiral Perry effected the
treaty of friendship with Japan which virtually opened that nation to the
influences of western civilization, and one of the most wonderful
transformations of a people recorded in history soon began. In 1867 a new
Mikado came to the throne, and in 1868 the small military class, which had
ruled the nation for some seven hundred years, gave up their power to the
new ruler. A new era in Japan, known as the _Meiji_, dates from this
event. In 1871 the centuries-old feudal system was abolished, and all
classes in the State were declared equal before the law. This same year
the first newspaper in Japan was begun. In 1872 the first educational code
for the nation was promulgated by the Mikado. This ordered the general
establishment of schools, the compulsory education of the people (R. 334
a), and the equality of all classes in educational matters. Students were
now sent abroad, especially to Germany and the United States; foreign
teachers were imported; an American normal-school teacher was placed in
charge of the newly opened state normal school; the American class method
of instruction was introduced; schoolbooks and teaching apparatus were
prepared, after American models; middle schools were organized in the
towns; higher schools were opened in the cities; and the old Academy of
Foreign Languages was evolved (1877) into the University of Tokyo. In 1884
the study of English was introduced into the courses of the public
schools. In 1889 a form of constitution was granted to the people, and a
parliament established. [4]

[Illustration: FIG. 213. THE JAPANESE TWO-CLASS SCHOOL SYSTEM.]

Adapting the continental European idea of a two-class school system to the
peculiar needs of the nation, the Japanese have worked out, during the
past half-century, a type of state-controlled school system which has been
well adapted to their national needs. [5] Instruction in national
morality, based on the ancestral virtues, brotherly affection, and loyalty
to the constitution and the ruling class (R. 334 b-c), has been well
worked out in their schools. Though the government has remained largely
autocratic in form, the Japanese have, however, retained throughout all
their educational development the fundamental democratic principle
enunciated in the Preamble to the Educational Code of 1872 (R. 334 a),
_viz_., that every one without distinction of class or sex shall receive
primary education at least, and that the opportunity for higher education
shall be open to all children. So completely has the education of the
people been conceived of as one of the most important functions of the
State that all education has been placed under a centralized state
control, with a Cabinet Minister in charge of all administrative matters
connected with the education of the nation.

[Illustration: FIG. 214. THE CHINESE EDUCATIONAL LADDER]

Since near the end of the nineteenth century what promises to be an even
more wonderful transformation of a people-political, social, scientific,
and industrial--has been taking place in China (R. 335). A much more
democratic type of national school system than that of the Japanese has
been worked out, and this the new (1912) Republic of China is rapidly
extending in the provinces, and making education a very important function
of the new democratic national life. [6] In the beginning, when displacing
the centuries-old Confucian educational system, [7] the Chinese adopted
Japanese ideas and organized their schools (1905) somewhat after the
Japanese model. Later on, responding to the influence of many American-
educated Chinese and to the more democratic impulses of the Chinese
people, the new government established by the Republic of 1912 changed the
school system at first established so as to make it in type more like the
American educational ladder. The new Chinese school system is shown in the
drawing on page 721. The university instruction is modern and excellent,
and the addition of the cultural and scientific knowledge worked out in
western Europe to the intellectual qualities of this capable people can
hardly fail to result, in time, in the production of a wonderful modern
nation, [8] probably in one of the greatest nations of the mid-twentieth
century.

In 1891 the independent Kingdom of Siam, [9] awakened from its age-long
isolation by new world influences, sent a prince to Europe to study and
report on the state systems of education maintained there. As a result of
his report a department of public education was created, which later
evolved into a ministry of public instruction, and elementary schools were
opened by the State in the thirteen thousand old Buddhist temples. These
schools offered a two-year course in Siamese, followed by a five-year
course in English, given by imported English teachers. Schools for girls
were provided, as well as for boys. Since this beginning, higher schools
of law, medicine, agriculture, engineering, and military science have been
added, taught largely by imported English and American teachers. In
consequence of the new educational organization, and the new influences
brought in, the whole life of this little kingdom has been transformed
during the past three decades.

GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE STATE-FUNCTION CONCEPTION. The different
national school systems, the creation of which has so far been briefly
described, are typical and represent a great world movement which
characterized the latter half of the nineteenth century. This movement is
still under way, and increasing in strength. Other state school
organizations might be added to the list, but those so far given are
sufficient. Beginning with the nations which were earliest to the front of
the onward march of civilization, the movement for the state control of
education, itself an expression of new world forces and new national
needs, has in a century spread to every continent on the globe. To-day
progressive nations everywhere conceive of education for their people as
so closely associated with their social, political, and industrial
progress, and their national welfare and prosperity (R. 336), that the
control of education has come to be regarded as an indispensable function
of the State. State constitutions (R. 333) have accordingly required the
creation of comprehensive state school systems; legislators have turned to
education with a new interest; bulky state school codes have given force
to constitutional mandates; national literacy has become a goal; the
diffusion of political intelligence by means of the school has naturally
followed the extension of the suffrage; while the many new forces and
impulses of a modern world have served to make the old religious type of
education utterly inadequate, and to call for national action to a degree
never conceived of in the days when religious, private, and voluntary
educational effort sufficed to meet the needs of the few who felt the call
to learn. What a few of the more important of these new nineteenth-century
forces have been, which have so fundamentally modified the character and
direction of education, it may be worth while to set forth briefly, before
proceeding further.


II. NEW MODIFYING FORCES

THE ADVANCE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. The first and most important of these
nineteenth-century forces, and the one which preceded and conditioned all
the others, was the great increase of accurate knowledge as to the forces
and laws of the physical world, arising from the application of scientific
method to the investigation of the phenomena of the material world (R.
337). During the nineteenth century the intellect of man was stimulated to
activity as it had not been before since the days when little Athens was
the intellectual center of the world. What the Revival of Learning was to
the classical scholars of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the
movement for scientific knowledge and its application to human affairs was
to the nineteenth. It changed the outlook of man on the problems of life,
vastly enlarged the intellectual horizon, and gave a new trend to
education and to scholarly effort. What the scholars of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries had been slowly gathering together as interesting
and classified phenomena, the scientific scholars of the nineteenth
century organized, interpreted, expanded, and applied. Since the day of
Copernicus (p. 386) and Newton (p. 388) a growing appreciation of the
permanence and scope of natural law in the universe had been slowly
developing, and this the scholars of the nineteenth century fixed as a
principle and applied in many new directions. A few of the more important
of these new directions may profitably be indicated here.

[Illustration: FIG. 215. BARON JUSTUS VON LIEBIG (1803-73)]

In the domain of the physical sciences very important advances
characterized the century. Chemistry, up to the end of the first quarter
of the nineteenth century largely a collection of unrelated facts, was
transformed by the labors of such men as Dalton (1766-1844), Faraday
(1791-1867), and Liebig into a wonderfully well-organized and vastly
important science. Liebig carried chemistry over into the study of the
processes of digestion and the functioning of the internal organs, and
reshaped much of the instruction in medicine. Liebig is also important as
having opened, at Giessen, in 1826, the first laboratory instruction in
chemistry for students provided in any university in the world. And when
some day you deign to pay The call that's overdue, I'll wave a landlord's
easy hand And say, "Admire _my_ view!"
Now I do not deny that a part of the content expressed in these lines may
come of resignation. In some moods, were I to indulge them, it were
pleasant to fancy myself owner of a vast estate, champaign and
woodland; able to ride from sea to sea without stepping off my own
acres, with villeins and bondmen, privileges of sak and soke,
infangthef, outfangthef, rents, tolls, dues, royalties, and a private
gallows for autograph-hunters.

These things, however, did not come to me by inheritance, and for a number
of sufficient reasons I have not amassed them. As for those other
ambitions which fill the dreams of every healthy boy, a number of
them had become of faint importance even before a breakdown of health
seemed definitely to forbid their attainment.
Here at home, far from London, with restored strength, I find myself less
concerned with them than are my friends and neighbours, yet more keenly
interested than ever in life and letters, art and politics--all that
men and women are saying and doing. Only the centre of gravity has
shifted, so to speak.

I dare say, then, that resignation may have some share in this content;
but if so 'tis an unconscious and happy one. A man who has been writing
novels for a good part of his life should at least be able to
sympathise with various kinds of men; and, for an example or two,
I can understand-- 
1.

Why Alexander cried (if he ever did) because he had no second world to
conquer.

2. Why Shakespeare, as an Englishman, wanted a coat of arms and a
respectable estate in his own native country town.

3. What and how deep are the feelings beneath that _cri du coeur_ of Mr.
Wilfrid Blunt's 'Old Squire:'--

"I like the hunting of the hare Better than that of the fox; I like the
joyous morning air, And the crowing of the cocks.

"I covet not a wider range Than these dear manors give; I take my pleasures
without change, And as I lived I live.

"Nor has the world a better thing, Though one should search it
round, Than thus to live one's own sole king Upon one's own sole
ground.

"I like the hunting of the hare; It brings me day by day The memory
of old days as fair, With dead men past away.

"To these as homeward still I ply, And pass the churchyard gate, Where all
are laid as I must lie, I stop and raise my hat.

"I like the hunting of the hare:
New sports I hold in scorn.
I like to be as my fathers were In the days ere I was born."
4.

What--to start another hare--were Goldsmith's feelings when he
wrote--
"And as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue Pants to the place from
whence at first she flew, I still had hopes, my long vexations past,
Here to return--and die at home at last." 
5.

With what heart Don Quixote rode forth to tilt at sheep and windmills,
and again with what heart in that saddest of all last chapters he
bade his friends look not for this year's birds in last year's nests.

6. Why the young man went away sadly, because he had great possessions
and could not see his way to bestowing them all on the poor; why, on the
contrary, St. Paulinus of Nola and St. Francis of Assisi joyfully renounced
their wealth; what Prudhon meant by saying that 'property is theft'; and
what a poor Welsh clergyman of the seventeenth century by proclaiming
in verse and prose that he was heir of all the world, and properties, hedges,
boundaries, landmarks meant nothing to him, since all was his that
his soul enjoyed; yes, and even what inspired him to pen this golden
sentence--
"_You will never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth
in your veins, till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned
with the stars._"
My window, then, looks out from a small library upon a small harbour
frequented by ships of all nations--British, Danish, Swedish,
Norwegian, Russian, French, German, Italian, with now and then an
American or a Greek--and upon a shore which I love because it is
my native country.

Of all views I reckon that of a harbour the most fascinating and the most
easeful, for it combines perpetual change with perpetual repose. It amuses
like a panorama and soothes like an opiate, and when you have realised
this you will understand why so many thousands of men around this island
appear to spend all their time in watching tidal water. Lest you
should suspect me of taking a merely dilettante interest in the view, I
must add that I am a Harbour Commissioner.

As for the house, it is a plain one; indeed, very like the house a
child draws on a slate, and therefore pleasing even externally to me, who
prefer the classical to any Gothic style of architecture. Why so many
strangers mistake it with its modest dimensions for a hotel, I cannot
tell you.
I found one in the pantry the other day searching for a brandy-and-soda;
another rang the dining-room bell and dumbfoundered the maid by
asking what we had for lunch; and a third (a lady) cried when I
broke to her that I had no sitting-room to let.

We make it a rule to send out a chair whenever some unknown invader
walks into the garden and prepares to make a water-colour sketch
of the view.

There are some, too, whose behaviour cannot be reconciled with the
hallucination of a hotel, and they must take the house for a public
institution of some kind, though of what kind I cannot guess.
There was an extremely bashful youth, for instance, who roamed the garden
for a while on the day after the late Duke of Cambridge's funeral,
and, suddenly dashing in by the back door, wanted to know why our flag
was not at half-mast. There was also a lady who called on the excuse
that she had made a life-study of the Brontes, and after opining (in
a guarded manner) that they came, originally, from somewhere in Yorkshire,
desired to be informed how many servants we kept. I have sometimes
thought of rechristening our house The Hotel of the Four Seasons, and
thereby releasing its true name (The Haven) to a friend who covets
it for his own.

On the whole, however, these visitors disturb the house and the
view from my window very little. The upper halves of them, as they pass up
and down the road, appear above my garden wall much as the shadows that
passed in Plato's cave. They come, enjoy their holiday, and go, leaving
the window intent upon the harbour, its own folk and its own business.

And now for the book, which is really not a book at all, but a chapter of
one.

Last autumn I returned from a holiday to find that the publishing season
had begun. This was announced by a stack of new books, review copies and
presentation copies, awaiting me on my window-seat. I regarded it sourly.

A holiday is the most unsettling thing in the world. At the end of it I
regain the well-worn chair with a sigh of pleasure and reach for the
familiar tobacco-jar, wondering how I could have been fool enough to leave
them; yet somehow this lively sense of repurchased habit does not
go far enough and compel me to work.

Being at home is a game, and so good a game that I play at it merely,
rearranging my shelves and, under pretence of dealing with arrears of
correspondence, skimming the literary papers and book-catalogues found
amid the pile of letters.

It happened that the first postal-wrapper to be broken enclosed a copy of
_The Academy_, and _The Academy_ opened with this sentence: "Since our
last issue we have received one hundred and nineteen new books and reprints."
I looked across to the pile on my window-seat and felt it to be
insignificant, though it interfered with my view of the English Channel.
One hundred and nineteen books in a single week! Yet who was I to exclaim
at their number?--I, who (it appeared) had contributed one of them? With
that I remembered something which had happened just before my holiday, and
began to reflect on it, for the first time seriously.

A publisher had asked me for a complete list of my published works, to
print it on the fly-leaf of another of them. I sat down with the best
intention and compiled it for him, and, in honest oblivion, omitted a
couple--of books, mind you--not of pamphlets, reviews, stray articles, short
stories, or any such trifles, but of books solemnly written for this
and future ages, solemnly printed, bound, and put into circulation at the
shops and libraries. (Here, for the due impressiveness of the tale, it
becomes necessary to tell you that their author is an indolent and painful
writer, slow at the best of times.)

Well, the discovery that I had forgotten two of my own books
at first amused and then set me thinking. "Here you are," said I
to myself, "a writer of sorts; and it's no use to pretend that you
don't wish to be remembered for a while after you are dead and done
with."

"Quite right," the other part of me assented cheerfully.

"Well, then," urged the inquisitor, "this is a bad look-out. If you had been
born a Dumas--I am speaking of fecundity, if you please, and of nothing
else--if you had been born a Dumas, and could rattle off a romance in
a fortnight, you might be excused for not keeping tally of your productions.
Pitiful, dilatory worker that you are, if _you_ cannot remember them, how
can you expect the world (good Heavens!) to take the trouble?"
"I suppose it won't," responded the other part of me, somewhat dashed;
then, picking up its spirits again, "But, anyhow, I shall know where to
lay the blame."
"On yourself?"
"Most assuredly not."
"Where, then?"

"Why, on the publishers."
"Ah, of course!" (This with fine irony.)
"Yes, on the publishers. Most authors do this during life, and now I
begin to see that all authors do it sooner or later. For my part, I shall
defer it to the future state."
"Why?"
"Obviously because there will be no publishers thereabouts to contradict
me."
"And of what will you accuse them?"
"That they never issued my work in the form it deserved."
"I see. Poor fellow! You have the 'Edinburgh' Stevenson or something
of that sort on your mind, and are filled with nasty envy."
Upon this the other part of me fairly lost its temper.

"The 'Edinburgh' Stevenson! The 'Edinburgh' Ste--, and you have known
me all these years! The 'Edinburgh' Stevenson is a mighty handsome edition
of a mighty fine writer, but I have no more desire to promenade the ages
in that costume than to jump the moon. No, I am not going to break any
more of the furniture.

I am handing you this chair that you may seat yourself and listen . . .
Now! The book which I shall accuse my publishers of not having produced
will be in one volume--"
"Come, come. Modesty is all very well, but don't overdo it."
"--folio."
"Oh!"
"--Of three thousand odd pages, printed (blunt type) in double columns, and
here and there in triple."
"O--oh!"
"--with marginalia by other hands, and footnotes running sometimes to twenty
thousand words, and, including above six thousand quotations from the
best poets--every one, in short, which has given me pleasure of a certain
quality, whether gentle or acute, at one time or another in my life."

"!!!"
"--The whole profusely, not to say extravagantly, adorned with woodcuts
in the text, not to mention fifty or sixty full-page illustrations in
copper."
"By eminent artists?"

"Some of them by eminent artists, for the reason only
that I number such among my friends; the rest by amateurs and
members of my household who would help, out of mere affection, in
raising this monument."

"They would do it execrably."
"I dare say; but that would not matter in the least. The book should be bound
in leather and provided with serviceable clasps, as well as with a
couple of inner pockets for maps and charts. The maps should contain
plenty of sea, with monsters rising from it--leviathans and
sea-serpents-- as they do in Speed's map of Cornwall which hangs in the
hall."
"Your book will need a window-seat to hold it."
"Ah, now you talk intelligently! It was designed for a window-seat, and
its fortunate possessor will take care to provide one. Have you any further
objections?"
"Only this: that a book of such a size written by one man (I make the
objection as little personal as I can) must perforce contain many
dull pages."
"Hundreds of them; whole reams of dull pages."

"They will be skipped."
"They will be inserted with that object."

"Oh!"
"It is one of the conditions of becoming a classic."
"Who will read you?"
"Look here. Do you remember the story of that old fellow--a Dutchman, I
think--who took a fancy to be buried in the church porch of his native town,
that he might hear the feet of the townsfolk, generation after generation,
passing over his head to divine service?"
"Well?"
"Well. I shall stand on my shelf, bound in good leather, between (say)
_Bayle's Dictionary_ and _Sibrandus Schnafnaburgensis, his Delectable
Treatise_; and if some day, when the master of the house has been coaxed
by his womenfolk to take a holiday, and they descend upon the books,
which he (the humbug) never reads, belabour and bang the dust out of
them and flap them with dusters, and all with that vindictiveness which
is the good housewife's right attitude towards literature--"
"Had you not better draw breath?"
"Thank you. I will: for the end of the protasis lies yet some way
off.
If, I say, some child of the family, having chosen me out of the heap
as a capital fellow for a booby-trap, shall open me by hazard and,
attracted by the pictures, lug me off to the window-seat, why then God bless
the child!
I shall come to my own. He will not understand much at the time, but he
will remember me with affection, and in due course he will give me
to his daughter among her wedding presents (much to her annoyance, but
the bridegroom will soothe her).

This will happen through several generations until I find myself an
heirloom. . . ."
"You begin to assume that by this time you will be valuable.
Also permit me to remark that you have slipped into the present indicative."

"As for the present indicative, I think you began it."
"No."
"Yes. But it doesn't matter. I begin precisely at the right moment to
assume a value which will be attached to me, not for my own sake, but
on account of dear grandpapa's book-plate and autograph on the
fly-leaf. (He was the humbug who never read me--a literary person; he
acquired me as a 'review copy,' and only forbore to dispose of me
because at the current railway rates I should not have fetched the
cost of carriage.)"
"Why talk of hindrances to publishing such a book, when you know full
well it will never be written?"
"I thought you would be driven to some such stupid knock-down argument.
Whether or not the book will ever be finished is a question that lies on
the knees of the gods. I am writing at it every day. And just such a
book was written once and even published; as I discovered the other
day in an essay by Mr. Austin Dobson. The author, I grant you, was
a Dutchman (Mr. Dobson calls him 'Vader Cats,') and the book
contains everything from a long didactic poem on Marriage (I also have
written a long didactic poem on Marriage) to a page on Children's
Games.

(My book shall have a chapter on Children's Games, with their proper
tunes.) As for poetry--poetry, says Mr. Dobson, with our Dutch poet is not
by any means a trickling rill from Helicon: 'it is an inundation _a
la mode du pays_, a flood in a flat land, covering everything far and
near with its sluggish waters.' As for the illustrations, listen
to this for the kind of thing I demand:--
"Perhaps the most interesting of these is to be found in the large
head-piece to the above-mentioned Children's Games, the background
of which exhibits the great square of Middleburgh, with its old
Gothic houses and central clump of trees.
This is, moreover, as delightful a picture as any in the gallery.
Down the middle of the foreground, which is filled by a crowd of
figures, advances a regiment of little Dutchmen, marching to drum
and fife, and led by a fire-eating captain of fifteen. Around this
central group are dispersed knots of children playing leap-frog,
flying kites, blowing bubbles, whipping tops, walking on stilts,
skipping, and the like.
In one corner the children are busy with blind man's buff; in the
other the girls, with their stiff head-dresses and vandyked aprons,
are occupied with their dolls. Under the pump some seventeenth-century
equivalent for chuck-farthing seems to be going on vigorously; and,
not to be behind-hand in the fun, two little fellows in the distance
are standing upon their heads. The whole composition is full of
life and movement, and--so conservative is childhood--might, but
for the costume and scene, represent a playground of to-day."
"Such are the pictures which shall emerge, like islands, among my
dull pages. And there shall be other pages, to be found for the
looking. . . .
I must make another call upon your memory, my friend, and refer it
to a story of Hans Andersen's which fascinated the pair of us in
childhood, when we were not really a pair but inseparables, and
before you had grown wise; the story of the Student and the Goblin
who lodged at the Butterman's. The Student, at the expense of his
dinner, had rescued a book from the butter-tub and taken it off to
his garret, and that night the Goblin, overcome by curiosity, peeped
through the keyhole, and lo! the garret was full of light.It was almost a century from the time instruction in Greek was revived in
Florence (1396) until Linacre first lectured on Greek at Oxford (c. 1492);
six months after the X-ray was perfected in Germany it was in use in the
hospitals of San Francisco. In the Middle Ages thousands might have died
of starvation in Persia or Egypt, a famous city in Asia Minor might have
been destroyed by an earthquake and many people killed, or war might have
raged for years in the Orient without a citizen of western Europe knowing
of it all his life. Today any important event anywhere within the range of
the telegraph or the cable would be reported in tomorrow morning's paper,
and carefully described and illustrated in the magazines at an early date.
Man is no longer a citizen of a town or a state, but of a nation and of
the world. How intelligently he can use this larger citizenship depends
today largely upon the character and the extent of the education he has
received.

[Illustration: FIG. 222. AN EXAMPLE OF THE SHIFTING OF OCCUPATIONS.
Sawing boards by hand, before the introduction of steam power.]

EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON THE LABORING-CLASSES. At first the effect of
the introduction of factory-made goods and labor-saving devices was to
upset the old established institutions. Trades practiced by the guilds
since the Middle Ages were destroyed, because factories could turn out
goods faster and cheaper than guild workmen could make them. The age-old
apprenticeship system began to break down. Everywhere people were thrown
out of employment, and a vast shifting of occupations took place. There
was much discontent, and laborers began to unite, where allowed to do so,
[20] with a view to improving their economic and political condition by
concerted action. The political revolutions of 1848 throughout Europe were
in part a manifestation of this discontent, and the right to organize was
everywhere demanded and in time generally obtained. Among the planks in
their platform were equality of all before the law; the limitation of
child and woman labor; better working conditions and wages; the provision
of schools for their children at public expense; and the extension of the
right of suffrage.

Despite certain unfortunate results following the change from age-old
working conditions, the century of transition has seen the laboring man
making gains unknown before in history, and the peasant has seen the
abolition of serfdom [21] and feudal dues. Homes have gained tremendously.
The drudgery and wasteful toil have been greatly mitigated. To-day there
is a standard of comfort and sanitation, even for those in the humblest
circumstances, beyond all previous conceptions. The poorest workman to-day
can enjoy in his home lighting undreamed of in the days of tallow candles;
warmth beyond the power of the old smoky soft-coal grate; food of a
variety and quality his ancestors never knew; kitchen conveniences and an
ease in kitchen work wholly unknown until recently; and sanitary
conveniences and conditions beyond the reach of the wealthiest half a
century ago. The caste system in industry has been broken down, and men
and their children may now choose their occupations freely, [22] and move
about at will. Wages have greatly increased, both actually and relatively
to the greatly improved standard of living. The work of women and children
is easier, and all work for shorter hours. Child labor is fast being
eliminated in all progressive nations. In consequence of all these changes
for the better, people to-day have a leisure for reading and thinking and
personal enjoyment entirely unknown before the middle of the nineteenth
century, and governments everywhere have found it both desirable and
necessary to provide means for the utilization of this leisure and the
gratification of the new desires. Along with these changes has gone the
development of the greatest single agent for spreading liberalizing ideas
--the modern newspaper--"the most inveterate enemy of absolutism and
reaction." Despite censorships, suppressions, and confiscations, the press
has by now established its freedom in all enlightened lands, and the
cylinder press, the telegraph, and the cable have become "indispensable
adjuncts to the development of that power which every absolutist has come
to dread, and with which every prime minister must daily reckon."


III. EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON EDUCATION

GENERAL RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. The general result of the vast and far-
reaching changes which we have just described is that the intellectual and
political horizon of the working classes has been tremendously broadened;
the home has been completely altered; children now have much leisure and
do little labor; and the common man at last is rapidly coming into his
own. Still more, the common man seems destined to be the dominant force in
government in the future. To this end he and his children must be
educated, his wife and children cared for, his home protected, and
governments must do for him the things which satisfy his needs and advance
his welfare. The days of the rule of a small intellectual class and of
government in the interests of such a class have largely passed, and the
political equality which the Athenian Greeks first in the western world
gave to the "citizens" of little Athens, the Industrial Revolution has
forced modern and enlightened governments to give to all their people. In
consequence, real democracy in government, education, justice, and social
welfare is now in process of being attained generally, for the first time
in the history of the world.

The effect of all these changes in the mode of living of peoples is
written large on the national life. The political and industrial
revolutions which have marked the ushering-in of the modern age have been
far-reaching in their consequences. The old home life and home industries
of an earlier period are passing, or have passed, never to return. Peoples
in all advanced nations are rapidly swinging into the stream of a new and
vastly more complex world civilization, which brings them into contact and
competition with the best brains of all mankind. At the same time a great
and ever-increasing specialization of human effort is taking place on all
sides, and with new and ever more difficult social, political,
educational, industrial, commercial, and human-life problems constantly
presenting themselves for solution. The world has become both larger and
smaller than it used to be, and even its remote parts are now being linked
up, to a degree that a century ago would not have been deemed possible,
with the future welfare of the nations which so long bore the brunt of the
struggle for the preservation and advancement of civilization.

THESE CHANGES AND THE SCHOOL. It is these vast and far-reaching political,
industrial, and social changes which have been the great actuating forces
behind the evolution and expansion of the state school systems which we
have so far described. The American and French political revolutions, with
their new philosophy of political equality and state control of education,
clearly inaugurated the movement for taking over the school from the
Church and the making of it an important instrument of the State. The
extension of the suffrage to new classes gave a clear political motive for
the school, and to train young people to read and write and know the
constitutional bases of liberty became a political necessity. The
industrial revolution which followed, bringing in its train such extensive
changes in labor and in the conditions surrounding home and child life,
has since completely altered the face of the earlier educational problem.
What was simple once has since become complex, and the complexity has
increased with time. Once the ability to read and write and cipher
distinguished the educated man from the uneducated; to-day the man or
woman who knows only these simple arts is an uneducated person, hardly fit
to cope with the struggle for existence in a modern world, and certainly
not fitted to participate in the complex political and industrial life of
which, in all advanced nations, he or she [23] to-day forms a part.

It is the attempt to remould the school and to make of it a more potent
instrument of the State for promoting national consciousness (R. 340) and
political, social, and industrial welfare that has been behind the many
changes and expansions and extensions of education which have marked the
past half-century in all the leading world nations, and which underlie the
most pressing problems in educational readjustment to-day. These changes
and expansions and problems we shall consider more in detail in the
chapters which follow. Suffice it here to say that from mere teaching
institutions, engaged in imparting a little religious instruction and some
knowledge of the tools of learning, the school, in all the leading
nations, has to-day been transformed into an institution for advancing
national welfare. The leading purpose now is to train for political and
social efficiency in the more democratic types of governments being
instituted among peoples, and to impart to the young those industrial and
social experiences once taught in the home, the trades, and on the farm,
but which the coming of the factory system and city life have deprived
them otherwise of knowing.

NEW PROBLEMS TO BE MET BY EDUCATION. As participation in the political
life of nations has been extended to larger and larger groups of the
people, and as the problems of government have become more and more
complex, the schools have found it necessary to add instruction in
geography, history, government, and national ideals and culture to the
earlier instruction. In the less democratic nations which have evolved
national school systems, this new instruction has often been utilized to
give strength to the type of government and social conditions which the
ruling class desired to have perpetuated. This has been the evident
purpose in Japan (R. 334), though the government of Imperial Germany
formed perhaps the best illustration of such perversion. This was seen and
pointed out long ago by Horace Mann (R. 281). There the idea of
nationality through education (R. 342) was carried to such an extreme as
made the government oppressive to subject peoples and a menace to
neighboring States. [24] On the other hand, the French have used their
schools for national ends (R. 341) in a manner that has been highly
commendable.

As the social life of nations has become broader and more complex, a
longer period of guidance has become necessary to prepare the future
citizens of the State for intelligent participation in it. As a result,
child life everywhere has and is still experiencing a new lengthening of
the period of dependence and training, and all national interests now
indicate that the period devoted to preparing for life's work will need to
be further lengthened. All recent thinking and legislation, as well as the
interests of organized labor and the public welfare, have in recent
decades set strongly against child labor. The pleasure they have given in
a limited circle has tempted the writer to print them. Some have never
before appeared in public, but most of them have been already published
in different works; some few, without the author's knowledge.

It will be found that these poems are intended for children of different
ages and characters. It may be objected to the book, that gay and
serious pieces are bound up together; but so it is in human life and human
nature, and it is essential to the healthful action of a child's mind that
it should be so. The smile that overtakes its tears is as necessary to
the child as the sun after a spring shower is to the young plant;
and without it a blight will fall upon the opening blossom.As large numbers of immigrants from distant lands have entered some of the
leading nations, notably England and the United States, and particularly
immigrants from less advanced nations where general education is not as
yet common, and where far different political, social, judicial, and
hygienic conditions prevail, a new duty has been thrust upon the school of
giving to such incoming peoples, and their children, some conception of
the meaning and method and purpose of the national life of the people they
have come among. The national schools have accordingly been compelled to
give attention to the needs of these new elements in the population, and
to direct their attention less exclusively to satisfying the needs of the
well-to-do classes of society. Educational systems have in consequence
tended more and more to become democratic in character, and to serve in
part as instruments for the assimilation of the stranger within the
nation's gates and for the perpetuation and improvement of the national
life.

EDUCATION A CONSTRUCTIVE NATIONAL TOOL. One result of the many political,
social, and industrial changes of a century has been to evolve education
into the great constructive tool of modern political society. For ages a
church and private affair, and of no great importance for more than a few,
it has to-day become the prime essential to good government and national
progress, and is so recognized by the leading nations of the world. As
people are freed from autocratic rule and take upon themselves the
functions of government, and as they break loose from their age-old
political, social, and industrial moorings and swing out into the current
of the stream of modern world-civilization, the need for the education of
the masses to enable them to steer safely their ship of state, and take
their places among the stable governments of a modern world, becomes
painfully evident. In the hands of an uneducated people a democratic form
of government is a dangerous instrument, while the proper development of
natural resources and the utilization of trade opportunities by backward
peoples, without being exploited, is almost impossible. In Russia, Mexico,
and the Central American "republics" we see the results of a democracy in
the hands of an uneducated people. There, too often, the revolver instead
of the ballot box is used to settle public issues, and instead of orderly
government under law we find injustice and anarchy. A general system of
education that will teach the fundamental principles of constitutional
liberty, and apply science to production in agriculture and manufacturing,
is almost the only solution for such conditions. By contrast with the
surrounding "republics" one finds in Guatemala [25] a country that has
used education intelligently as a tool to advance the interests of its
people.

[Illustration: FIG. 223. THE PHILIPPINE SCHOOL SYSTEM
A teacher-training course is given as one of the vocational courses in the
Intermediate School, and the Normal School at Manila represents one of the
secondary school courses. The University, besides the combined five-year
college course, has eight professional courses of from three to five years
in length.]

When the United States freed Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines from
Spanish rule, a general system of public education, modeled after the
American educational ladder, was created as a safeguard to the liberty
just brought to these islands, and to education the United States added
courts of justice and bureaus of sanitation as important auxiliary
agencies. As a result the peoples of these islands have made a degree of
progress in self-government and industry in three decades not made in
three centuries under Spanish rule. The good results of the work done in
these islands in establishing schools, building roads and bridges,
introducing police courts, establishing good sanitary conditions, building
hospitals and training nurses, applying science to agriculture, developing
tropical medicine, and training the people in the difficult art of self-
government, will for long be a monument to the political foresight and
intelligent conceptions of government held by the American people. The
trustees who got control of it promised to make something new of it but
did not administer the affairs successfully and they were involved in law
suits there with the Negroes, who endeavored to obtain control of it. It
finally failed, despite the fact that the court of chancery appointed
a new board of trustees and granted a bill to incorporate the institution
as Wilberforce University, which existed a few years.

Henson showed his patriotism in serving as captain to the second Essex
company of colored volunteers in the Canadian Rebellion, going to the
aid of the government which gave them asylum from slavery. His company
held Fort Maiden from Christmas until the following May and also took the
schooner _Ann_ with three hundred arms and two cannons, musketry
and provisions for the rebel troops. They held the fort until they were
relieved by the colonel of the 44th regiment from England. Then came the
Civil War. Henson was too old to go, but his relatives enlisted. He was
charged with having violated the foreign enlistment act and was arrested
and acquitted after some harrowing experiences.

Henson made a third trip to England near the close of his career. Many of
his friends had passed away, but he met his old supporter, Samuel Morley.
He made the acquaintance also of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton Hart, R. C.
L. Bevan, and Professor Fowler. But he was then the hero of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin." The English people had read of him. They then wanted to see him.
He spoke at the Victoria Park Tabernacle and held in London a farewell
meeting in Spurgeon's Tabernacle. The buildings were thronged to
their utmost capacity and eager crowds on the outside made desperate
efforts to see him. He was then called to Scotland that the people
farther north might also see this hero.With one gambler's throw he dashed his future to the ground,
and unmasked himself before the world!

EXPANSION OF THE EDUCATIONAL IDEA. In all lands to-day where there is an
intelligent government, the education of the people through a system of
state-controlled schools is regarded as of the first importance in
moulding and shaping the destinies of the nation and promoting the
country's welfare. Beginning with education to impart the ability to read
and write and cipher, and as an aid to the political side of government,
the education of the masses has been so expanded in scope during the
century that today it includes aims, classes, types of schools, and forms
of service scarcely dreamed of at the time the State began to take over
the school from the Church, with a view to extending elementary
educational advantages and promoting literacy and citizenship. What some
of the more important of these expansions have been we shall state in a
following chapter, but before doing so let us return to another phase of
the problem--that of the progress of educational theory--and see what have
been the main lines of this progress in the theory as to the educational
purpose since the time when Pestalozzi formulated a theory for the secular
school.
