Typographically, effort has been made to change the text as
little as possible. The 'long s' has been converted, but none of
the original spelling has been modified. Text which was centred
has been indented eight spaces from the left margin. Right
justified text is indifferently aligned in the original text; here
all right justified text is aligned to the right-hand margin.
The horizontal and vertical indentation of lines reflects the
original text.

Italics are indicated by underscores, and punctuation has not
been included inside the italics except for periods which indicate
an abbreviation, or when an entire sentence is italicised.

There is a macron over an 'e' on the last line of E3v, which has
been rendered as 'ê' in this transcription.]

The Tragicall Historie of
HAMLET
Prince of Denmarke.


        _Enter two Centinels._

1. Stand: who is that?
2. T'is I.
1. O you come most carefully vpon your watch,
2. And if you meet _Marcellus_ and _Horatio_,
The partners of my watch, bid them make haste.
1. I will: See who goes there.
        _Enter Horatio and Marcellus._
_Hor._ Friends to this ground.
_Mar._ And leegemen to the Dane,
O farewell honest souldier, who hath releeued you?
1. _Barnardo_ hath my place, giue you goodnight.
_Mar._ Holla, _Barnardo_.
2. Say, is _Horatio_ there?
_Hor._ A peece of him.
2. Welcome _Horatio_, welcome good _Marcellus_.
_Mar._ What hath this thing appear'd againe to night.
2. I haue seene nothing.
_Mar._ _Horatio_ says tis but our fantasie,
And wil not let beliefe take hold of him,
Touching this dreaded sight twice seene by vs,
Therefore I haue intreated him a long with vs                         [B1v]
To watch the minutes of this night,
That if againe this apparition come,
He may approoue our eyes, and speake to it.
  _Hor._ Tut, t'will not appeare.
  2. Sit downe I pray, and let vs once againe
Assaile your eares that are so fortified,
What we haue two nights seene.
  _Hor._ Wel, sit we downe, and let vs heare _Bernardo_ speake
of this.
  2. Last night of al, when yonder starre that's west-
ward from the pole, had made his course to
Illumine that part of heauen. Where now it burnes,
The bell then towling one.

        _Enter Ghost._

  _Mar._ Breake off your talke, see where it comes againe.
  2. In the same figure like the King that's dead,
  _Mar._ Thou art a scholler, speake to it H_oratio_.
  2. Lookes it not like the king?
  _Hor._ Most like, it horrors mee with feare and wonder.
  2. It would be spoke to.
  _Mar._ Question it H_oratio_.
  _Hor._ What art thou that thus vsurps the state, in
Which the Maiestie of buried _Denmarke_ did sometimes
Walke? By heauen I charge thee speake.
  _Mar._ It is offended.                                 _exit Ghost._
  2. See, it stalkes away.
  _Hor._ Stay, speake, speake, by heauen I charge thee
speake.
  _Mar._ Tis gone and makes no answer.
  2. How now H_oratio_, you tremble and looke pale,
Is not this something more than fantasie?
What thinke you on't?
  _Hor._ Afore my God, I might not this beleeue, without
the sensible and true auouch of my owne eyes.
  _Mar._ Is it not like the King?                                     [B2]
  _Hor._ As thou art to thy selfe,
Such was the very armor he had on,
When he the ambitious _Norway_ combated.
