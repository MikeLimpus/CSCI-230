THE APOSTLES CHOSEN


As soon as he returned victorious from the temptation in the
wilderness, Jesus entered on the work of his public ministry. We find
him, at once, preaching to the people, healing the sick, and doing
many wonderful works. The commencement of his ministry is thus
described by St. Matt. iv: 23-25. "And Jesus went about all Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the
kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of
disease among the people. And his fame went throughout all Syria; and
they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers
diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils,
and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he
healed them. And there followed him great multitudes of people from
Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and
from beyond Jordan." What a blessed beginning of the most blessed of
all ministries this was! He came to bless our world. He did bless it,
as no one else could have done. And here, we see, how he entered on
his work.

And one of the first things he did, after thus beginning his
ministry, was to gather his disciples round him. Having this letter
safely in the hands of the Government, the General waited for
developments; then as soon as the ministry under General Azcarraga
had gone out of office and that of Señor Sagasta had come in,
he cabled to the new Prime Minister, saying that he had no intention
of resigning his office, but instead, begged to offer his services
to the new ministry.

A great excitement is being worked up over him in Cuba, which his
enemies declare is being done by his orders. Soldiers are parading
the streets, crying, "Long live Weyler!"

Merchants are hurrying to the palace, begging him not to resign,
and a rumor having been circulated that it is the United States that
has been asking that he be sent away from Cuba, the soldiers are
adding cries of "Death to the United States!"
The Cuban and American residents of Havana are terror-stricken. Much
as they desired to be free of the tyrant, they now dread his
downfall lest it shall cause more trouble for them.

It is said that Señor Sagasta will try to bring the war to a close by
offering liberal terms of Home Rule to Cuba.

In fact, the new cabinet has already held a council in which
it was agreed to establish reforms in the island with as little delay
as possible.

The Colonial Minister has been instructed to prepare a draft of the
scheme for Home Rule, and to have it ready to present to the cabinet
officers at their next meeting.

The Cubans, however, declare that they do not want Home Rule.

They have been fighting for freedom, and nothing less will satisfy
them. They are willing to buy their freedom from Spain, but they declare
that they will never lay down their arms until Cuba is free.

A despatch from the Philippine Islands brings the news that Spain is
faring badly in that direction also.

In a recent battle four hundred Spanish soldiers were killed.

It seems that the rebels in the Philippines fight in the American
Indian fashion; that is to say, they get under cover, behind bushes
or trees, and, taking careful aim at their enemy, make every
shot tell. In this manner they are able to inflict great injury
without suffering much themselves.

It is reported that an entire battalion of Spanish soldiers, eight
hundred strong, has deserted in a body to the rebels.

The soldiers in the Philippines are suffering just as severely
for food and pay as their brother soldiers in Cuba, and finding
that the rebels feed their soldiers well, and treat them better
than the Spaniards, great numbers are constantly deserting and
joining the rebel ranks

Affairs in Greece are still unsettled.

When the Prime Minister told the Boulé[A] or parliament the terms
of the treaty, there was much dissatisfaction expressed by the
members.

Mr. Ralli, the Prime Minister, stated that he was fully aware how
hard the terms of the treaty were, but he thought that Greece must
accept and make the best of them.

He told the Boulé that it was not possible for Greece to continue
the war; she had neither men nor money to do it with; but he wished
it understood that he was merely stating his opinion; he would not
attempt to advise the nation on such a serious point.

If the Boulé decided to accept the terms offered by Turkey, he
stated that the ministry was prepared to carry them out, and do all
in its power to assist the country in the crisis; he, however, asked
the Boulé, on behalf of the ministry, for a vote of confidence,
that is, an expression of belief that the ministers were doing the
best that could be done for the good of the country.

When Mr.

Ralli had finished speaking, a member of the House rose to his feet,
and began to blame the ministry for all the ills that Greece was
called upon to endure.

This turned the members against Mr.

Ralli and the rest of the ministers, and the vote of confidence
was refused. Mr. Ralli was thereupon obliged to send his resignation
to the King.

King George has already chosen the new Premier, and a Greek prince of
high rank has been selected to go to Constantinople and arrange the
treaty, the Boulé having decided to accept the terms offered.

Both Spain and Greece now have new ministers who are undertaking the
difficult task of piloting their countries through their
difficulties.

It was just as well that we did not put too much faith in the story
that the war on the Indian frontier would be ended with the defeat
of the Haddah Mullah.

News has reached us that the British forces have once again been
checked by the tribesmen.

This time it was the Mohmads who were the victors. These men, if you
remember, professed themselves ready to submit to English rule, and
when the troops arrived in their neighborhood, offered their allegiance
to the British officers.

They were, however, told that to prove their good faith they must, one
and all, give up their rifles. Upon hearing this they became sulky,
and refused to do anything of the sort.

The British waited the two days they had promised, and then began to
destroy the villages of the rebellious tribesmen.

On one of these expeditions they were in turn attacked by the
Afridis, and defeated.

In the meanwhile the Ameer of Afghanistan is uneasy over the advance
of the British into the hills that form his frontier. He is afraid
that the British will not be satisfied with punishing the tribesmen,
but will endeavor to take possession of lands belonging to him.

He has therefore sought the aid of Russia, and has obtained the
Czar's promise to help him in case the British attempt to encroach
on Afghanistan.

He is at the same time keeping faith with the English. He has issued
a proclamation, forbidding his subjects to leave the country under
penalty of a heavy fine, so that it will not be possible for them to
go and join the tribesmen. He is doing all in his power to keep faith
with England, but it is said that he is much pleased that he has secured
the aid of Russia to protect him in case of need.

In the Soudan, the English are steadily advancing on Khartoum.

The Mahdists are making a strong stand there, and it is expected that
the decisive battle will be fought in the near neighborhood of that
city.

A newspaper correspondent who is with the Soudan expedition writes
a most interesting account of the rapid way the soldiers are building
a railroad across the desert.

The road is being finished at the rate of nearly two miles a day, and
when completed will enable the army to bring men and supplies from
Cairo in a few days instead of the many weary weeks which are now
required.

The building of the railway through the desert has been entrusted
to the engineer corps.

These engineers are soldiers whose duty it is to build fortifications,
railroads, bridges, or any works which the commander of the force
may think necessary.

In building a railroad the first thing to be done is to prepare the
road-bed, so that it will not give way under the weight of the trains
that are to pass over it. This is done by digging out or banking up
the earth so that the bed shall be level. When the earth-bank has
been made as high and as solid as necessary, huge wooden beams,
called sleepers, are placed across it at regular intervals, and on
these sleepers the rails are laid.

The correspondent describes the laying of the rails as follows:

"A great sight was the actual work of laying the line. We went out
in a car drawn by a spare engine, to see this at the place where the
work was in progress.

The second construction train had reached the scene of active
operations just before we arrived, and the desert fairly hummed
with busy turmoil. It has been given but to few to see a railway
line made and used while you wait.

Yet we had that experience on this afternoon. Everything was done
at once. The long train moves slowly toward the end of the rails,
getting as near to the bare bank as is possible. So soon as she
stops, an eager army of workers attack her, with, of course, much
wild noise of strange rhythmic chant.

To the uninitiated this onslaught of the workers on the train bears
all the appearance of a raid, yet, should one watch awhile, it
gradually dawns upon one that marvellous orderliness and most studied
method underlie every seemingly wild movement. The engine stops--say,
ten rail lengths from the end of the track--and the game begins. The
rail-cars are in front, just behind the tender, with the rails neatly
ranged on racks.

At once to either side of each rail-car rushes a party of, if Egyptians,
eight men, if blacks, ten, upon whose padded shoulders the ton of
sun-heated metal is placed by the car party. Then they run--they
do literally run--away with the unwieldy thing to its destined
place, where, once it is placed on the sleepers, the gaugers and
strikers get at it, and it is put in position and pinned (to each
alternate sleeper, the operation being completed after the heavy
train has passed over the newly laid rails) in an incredibly short
time, at the end of which a bugle sounds, the steam whistle blows,
the engine moves slowly forward over the rails that less than five
minutes ago were stacked on the cars behind her, and the whole
operation is repeated

."

Hawaiian affairs continue to progress peacefully, notwithstanding
the fact that the story of Japanese soldiers being introduced in
Hawaii disguised as laborers has been confirmed by so many people
that our Government has no longer any doubt of its truth.

  Orders have therefore been
    sent to the commander of
  the fleet at Honolulu to be on
    the alert, and in case Japan should attempt any hostile movement
to land a company of marines and sailors, run up the American flag,
and take possession of the island in the name of the United States.

  The gunboats _Wheeling_ and
    _Concord_ have been sent
  to the Sandwich Islands, and a
    cruiser and several gunboats will be kept at Honolulu until all
fear of trouble is over.

  The Japanese ship, the _Naniwa_,
    has gone back to her own country
  to be cleaned and repaired, but will
    return to Hawaii as soon as this has been done.

  During her absence our Government
    is taking advantage of the
  opportunity to make some necessary
    changes in the ships stationed at Honolulu, and when the Japanese
cruiser returns she will find quite a fleet of American ships waiting
to receive her.

  A statement has been made that the
    Japanese Government is willing
  to settle the immigration dispute
    with Hawaii for $100,000.

  
    Hawaii is not anxious to make any
  such arrangement. She is a little afraid
    that if she consents to do so, Japan will declare that she is bound
in future to let in as many Japanese immigrants as the Mikado chooses
to send.

She is anxious to reserve the right of declaring what citizens she
will allow within her boundaries.

The annexation of the islands is by some people regarded as assured.

The Senators and Congressmen who have visited the islands declare that
there is no opposition to the idea. Some few followers of the Queen
Liliuokalani would prefer to have her once more on the throne
rather than to be under the government of a foreign president, but
there is no serious opposition to the treaty.

With this news comes the information that Mr.

Spreckels, the Sugar King of Hawaii, has offered to withdraw his
opposition to the treaty when he is convinced that his rights in the
island are not to be interfered with.

Mr. Spreckels is a millionaire who has made most of his money through
his vast sugar interests in the Sandwich Islands. He was so afraid
that his business would be hurt by annexation, that he threatened
to spend half his fortune to prevent it.

Besides his sugar interests, he owns a line of steamers between
Hawaii and San Francisco, and he controlled so many votes in Hawaii
that he was a dangerous enemy to the project.

President Dole of the Sandwich Islands has been endeavoring to break
Mr.
Spreckels' power, but has made very little progress until the other
day, when he granted permission to one of the Pacific mail steamers
to enter into competition with Mr. Spreckels' boats for the carrying
trade of the islands. The permission stated that the President would
allow the Pacific Mail Company to increase the number of vessels on
the line if they desired to do so.

This was a dreadful blow to Mr. Spreckels.

The carrying trade with Hawaii is hardly large enough for several
companies to make money at it, and as the new line will endeavor by
reduced rates and increased accommodations to get the trade away from
Mr. Spreckels, the chances are that he will lose a good deal of money
through it.

It is in consequence of this that he is reported to have promised
not to oppose the annexation of Hawaii if his interests are not
interfered with.

It is said that President Dole is so anxious that nothing shall
interfere with the annexation treaty that he is willing to promise
Mr.
Spreckels anything he asks in return for his assistance.

Central America is in a very disturbed condition once more.

Revolutions are in progress, or have just been suppressed in
Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua; and Honduras is again
in an unsettled state.

In addition to this, there is bad feeling between Costa Rica and
Nicaragua, which may break out into war at any moment.

As this last quarrel concerns the Nicaraguan Canal, in which our
country is so much interested, it is perhaps better to tell you
about it before we speak of the more serious troubles in Guatemala.

The cause of the unpleasantness between Nicaragua and Costa Rica
is the boundary line which divides them.

This boundary question involves the mouth of the Nicaragua Canal.

In 1858 it was agreed between the two countries that the channel of
the Rio San Juan del Norte at its exit into the ocean should be the
dividing line between them.

Owing to changes of current and other causes, the course of this
river has changed, until it is now several miles farther south
than it was in 1858.

Costa Rica claimed that the boundary should be the spot where the
old channel was; Nicaragua, that the treaty called for the channel
of the river where it emptied itself into the sea, and that therefore
the new mouth of the river is the boundary.

It is a serious matter for Nicaragua, for the opening to the Nicaragua
Canal on the Atlantic Ocean side is through the Rio San Juan del
Norte.

If Costa Rica were to own the mouth of the canal while Nicaragua
owns its body, there would be no end to the complications and
troubles which would arise.

The matter was therefore submitted to arbitration, President Cleveland
appointing the arbitrator.

The decision has just been rendered, and is against Costa Rica.

The arbitrator decides that the old treaty holds good, and that the
boundary line of Nicaragua is the channel of the river as it flows
into the ocean, and that no matter how far the Rio San Juan del
Norte creeps down into Costa Rican territory, Nicaragua will always
own to the channel where it flows into the sea.

Costa Rica is of course angry that the decision was against her, and
she may try to secure her lost territory by force of arms.

This is the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican trouble. The disturbance in
Guatemala is in the shape of a revolution, which, if the accounts we
hear are true, is of a serious nature.

We have told you before of the many revolutions that are constantly
taking place in South America, and that the people have become so
accustomed to them that they take very little notice of such things,
and no one regards a Central American revolution as a serious
affair.

Now while it is amusing to make fun of these toy revolutions, some
of the best people of the country suffer severely through them,
and to these people they are very real and terrible.

Those who suffer most are the merchants. During the disturbances
caused by constant changes of government, trade cannot properly
flourish, and many of the merchants of Central America wish heartily
that a means may be found to restore order and give them a government
which will be likely to last.

Some time ago a plan was made to form the five republics of Guatemala,
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica into one republic,
under one government.

  At this time Mexico objected to the plan.
    She was afraid that a strong
  republic at her doors might give her
    more trouble than she was likely to have from the five weak little
countries.

  Attempts were made to carry the plan
    through, but it was finally
  abandoned.
    

  It was not, however, forgotten, and
    in January of this year the
  first step was taken toward such
    an arrangement, by the union of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador,
forming together the Greater Republic of Central America.

  It was hoped that Guatemala and Costa
    Rica would also join in, and
  in June of this year Guatemala did join
    the other republics.

Mexico still disapproved of the plan, and was not at all pleased
that the Greater Republic of Central America had been formed.

The level-headed men of Central America then suggested that Mexico
should be asked to join the union, and one vast Central American
Republic be formed.

To this President Barrios of Guatemala objected. He is perhaps the
most ambitious man in Central America, and undoubtedly aims to be
the president of the Central American Republic. Were Mexico to become
a part of this great federation, Barrios would have a strong
rival in the beloved President Diaz of Mexico, and so he steadfastly
set his face against union with Mexico.

The friends of solid government were much disappointed at this, and it
is stated on good authority that they then formed a plot, which has
resulted in the present disturbances throughout Central America.

It was decided that as Barrios of Guatemala and Diaz of Mexico
were opposed to the plan, they must both be removed from office as
soon as it could be managed.

According to this story, Barrios was the first to give his enemies the
opportunity they sought.

We have told you that he is a very ambitious man. In Guatemala
presidents are elected for six years, and are not allowed to be
re-elected.
President Barrios is very near the end of his term, and he could
not bear to think that in a few months he would go out of office,
and lose all chance of rising to the heights he wished to attain.
He therefore had himself proclaimed dictator of Guatemala, and
announced that he intended to have a law passed which would allow
a president to be elected for a second term.
This meant of course that he intended to be elected again, and that
it would be another six years before there was any hope of forming
the federation.
The people of Guatemala strongly disapproved of Barrios' action in
making himself a dictator instead of a president. A president is
guided by the wishes of the legislature, and though he has the power
to veto, or forbid the passing of, a law made by congress, that
body has also power to overrule his veto, and pass the laws in spite
of him. So you see the power is pretty equally balanced. Then, too,
a president can be impeached, or called to account, if he neglects
the duties which he has agreed to fulfil.
With a dictator it is very different. He has absolute power in the
government of the state. His word is law, and he is not accountable
to the legislature for his actions.There is
no passage in the Bible that has given me so much comfort and
encouragement in trying to work for God as this I refer here to Is.
xli: 10. "Fear thou not; for I am with thee; be not dismayed; for I
am thy God; I will strengthen thee; yea--I WILL HELP THEE." This
promise was not given for prophets and apostles only, but for all
God's people to the end of time. You and I, if we are trying to serve
God, may take it as ours. God meant it for us. And when we get this
promised help from God, we can do any work he has for us to do, and
be happy in doing it.

"For Thine is the Power." "I can't do it--it's quite impossible. I've
tried five times, and can't get it right"--and Ben Hartley pushed his
book and slate away in despair. Ben was a good scholar. He was at
the head of his class, and was very anxious to stay there. But the
sums he had now to do were very hard. He could not do them, and was
afraid of losing his place in the class. Most of the boys had some
one at home to help them; but Ben had no one. His father was dead,
and his mother, though a good Christian woman, had not been to school
much when a girl, and she could not help Ben.

Mrs. Hartley felt sorry for her son's perplexity, and quietly said,
"Then, Ben, you don't believe in the Lord's prayer?"

"The Lord's prayer, mother! Why, there's nothing there to help a
fellow do his sums."

"O, yes; there is. There is help for every trouble in life in the
Lord's prayer, if we only know how to use it. I was trying a long
time before I found out what the last part of this prayer really
means. I'm no minister, or scholar, Ben, but I'll try and show you.
You know that in this prayer we ask God for our daily bread; we ask
him to keep us from evil; and to forgive us our sins; and then we
say: 'for _thine_ is the _kingdom_, and _the power_, and the glory.'
It's God's power that we rely on--not our own; and it often helps
me, Ben, when I have something hard to do. I say, 'For _thine_ is the
power--this is my duty, heavenly Father; but I can't do it myself;
give me thy power to help me,' and he does it, Ben, he does it."

Ben sat silent. It seemed almost too familiar a prayer. And yet he
remembered when he had to stay home from school because he had no
clothes fit to go in, how he prayed to God about it, and the
minister's wife brought him a suit the very next day. "But a boy's
sums, mother! it seems like such a little thing to ask God about."

"Those sums are not a little thing to you, Ben. Your success at
school depends on your knowing how to do them. _That_, is as much to
you, as many a greater thing to some one else. Now I care a great
deal about that, because I love you. And I know your Father in heaven
loves you more than I do. I would gladly help you, if I could; but he
_can_ help you. His 'is the power;' ask him to help you."

After doing an errand for his mother, Ben picked up his book and
slate and went up to his little room. Kneeling down by the bed he
repeated the Lord's prayer. When he came to--"thine is the kingdom,"
he stopped a moment, and then said, with all his heart--"'And thine
is the power,' heavenly Father. I want power to know how to do these
sums. There's no one else to help me. Lord, please give me power, for
Jesus' sake, Amen."

Ben waited a moment, and then, still on his knees, he took his slate
and tried again. Do you ask me if he succeeded? Remember what Saint
James says, "If any man lack wisdom let him ask of God, who giveth to
all men liberally, and upbraideth not: _and it shall be given him_."
Jas. i: 5. That is God's promise, and heaven and earth must pass away
before one of his promises shall fail. Ben had prayed to God to help
him, and God answered his prayer. He tried once more to work out
those sums. After thinking over them a little while, he saw the
mistake he had made in neglecting one of the rules for working the
sums. He corrected this mistake, and then he found they all worked
out beautifully. The next day he was head of the class; for he was
the only boy who could say that he had done the sum himself, without
getting any one at home to help him.

"And yet I was helped, mother," said Ben, "for I am sure my Father in
heaven helped me." But that was not what the teacher meant. After
this, Ben never forgot the last part of the Lord's prayer. When he
needed help he knew where the power was that could help him.

Here was where the apostles got the help they needed in doing the
hard work they had to do. And how much help we might get in doing our
work if we only make a right use of this "power which belongeth unto
God;" and which he is always ready to use in helping us.

The help they received, is the third thing to remember when we think
about the apostles and their work.

_The last thing to bear in mind when we think of Jesus choosing his
twelve apostles, is_--THE LESSON--_it teaches us_.

There are many lessons we might learn from this subject; but there is
one so much more important than all the rest that we may very well
let them go, and think only of this one. When St. Luke tells us about
Jesus choosing the twelve apostles, he mentions one very important
thing, of which St. Matthew, in his account of it says nothing at
all. And it is this thing from which we draw our lesson. In the
twelfth verse of the sixth chapter of his gospel, St. Luke
says--"And it came to pass in those days, that he (Jesus) went out
into a mountain to pray, and _continued all night in prayer to God_."
And after this, the first thing he did, in the morning, was to call
his disciples to him, and out of them to choose the twelve, who were
to be his apostles. And the lesson we learn from this part of the
subject is:

"The Lesson of Prayer." Jesus spent the whole night in prayer to God,
before he chose his apostles. How strange this seems to us! And yet
it is easy enough to see at least two reasons why he did this. One
was because _he loved to pray_. We know how pleasant it is for us to
meet, and talk with a person whom we love very much. But prayer
is--talking with God--telling him what we want, and asking his help.
But Jesus loved his Father in heaven, with a love deeper and stronger
than we can understand. This must have made it the most delightful of
all things for him to be engaged in prayer, or in talking with his
Father in heaven. And, if we really love Jesus, prayer will not be a
hard duty to us, but a sweet privilege. We shall love to pray,
because, in prayer we are talking to that blessed Saviour, "whom,
not having seen, we love." And this was one reason why Jesus spent
the whole night in prayer, before choosing his twelve apostles.

But there was another reason why Jesus spent so much time in prayer
before performing this important work, and that was to _set us an
example_. It was to teach us the very lesson of which we are now
speaking--the lesson of prayer. Remember how much power and wisdom
Jesus had in himself; and what mighty things he was able to do. And
yet, if _He_ felt that it was right to pray before engaging in any
important work, how much more necessary it is for us to do so!

Let us learn this lesson well. Let it be the rule and habit of our
lives to connect prayer with everything we do. This will make us
happy in our own souls, and useful to those about us.

How full the Bible is of the wonders that have been wrought by
prayer! Just think for a moment of some of them.

Abraham prays, and Lot is delivered from the fiery flood that
overwhelmed Sodom and Gomorrah. Gen. xix: 29. Jacob prays, and he
wrestles with the angel, and obtains the blessing; his brother
Esau's mind is wonderfully turned away from the wrath he had
cherished for twenty years. Moses prays and Amalek is discomfited.
Joshua prays and Achan is discovered. Hannah prays and Samuel is
born. David prays and Ahithophel hangs himself. Elijah prays and a
famine of three years comes upon Israel. He prays again, and the rain
descends, and the famine ends. Elisha prays, and Jordan is divided.
He prays again, and the dead child's soul is brought back from the
invisible world. Isaiah and Hezekiah pray, and a hundred and
eighty-five thousand Assyrian soldiers are slain in one night by the
unseen sword of the angel. These are Bible illustrations of the help
God gives to his people in answer to prayer. And the Bible rule for
prayer, as given by our Saviour, is, "that men ought _always_ to
pray," Luke xviii: 1. St. Paul's way of stating it is--"Praying
always, with all prayer," Ephes. vi: 18. In another place he
says--"Pray without ceasing," I. Thess. v: 17. And even the heathen
teach the same rule about prayer. Among the rules of Nineveh, an
inscription on a tablet has been found, which, on being translated,
proved to contain directions about prayer. It may be entitled:

"An Assyrian Call to Prayer." These are the words of the call:

    "Pray thou! pray thou!
    Before the couch, pray!
    Before the throne, pray!
    Before the canopy, pray!
    Before the building of the lofty head, pray!
    Before the rising of the dawn, pray!
    Before the fire, pray!
    By the tablets and papyri, pray!
    By the side of the river, pray!
    By the side of a ship, or riding in a ship, or leaving the ship, pray!
    At the rising of the sun, or the setting of the sun, pray!
    On coming out of the city, on entering the city, pray!
    On coming out of the great gate, on entering the great gate, pray!
    On coming out of the house, pray! on entering the house, pray!
    In the place of judgment, pray!
    In the temple, pray!"

This is like the Bible rule of--"praying always."

"Praying for a Dinner." "Grandma, aren't we going to church this
morning?" asked a little girl.

"My child, we have had no breakfast, and have no dinner to eat when
we come back," said her grandma.

"But the Lord Jesus can give it to us if we ask him," said the little
girl. "Let's ask him." So they kneeled down, and asked that God, "who
feedeth the young ravens when they cry," to remember them, and help
them.

Then they went to church. They found it very much crowded. An old
gentleman took the little girl upon his knee. He was pleased with her
quiet behaviour. On parting with her at the close of the service, he
slipped a half crown into her hand. "See, Grandma," she said, as soon
as they were out of church, "Jesus has sent us our dinner."

But when we ask God to help us, we must always try to help ourselves.

"Working as well as Praying." Two little girls went to the same
school; one of them, named Mary, always said her lessons well, the
other, named Jane, always failed. One day Jane said, "Mary, how does
it happen that you always say your lessons so well?" Mary said she
prayed over her lessons, and _that_ was the secret of her success.

Jane concluded to try praying. But the next day she failed worse than
ever. In tears, she reproached Mary for deceiving her. "But, did you
study hard, as well as pray over your lesson?" asked Mary.

"No; I thought if I only prayed, that was all I had to do," replied
Jane. "Not at all. God only helps those who try to help themselves.
You must study hard as well as pray, if you wish to get your lessons
well," was Mary's wise answer. The next day Jane studied, as well as
prayed, and she had her lesson perfectly.

The greatest work we can ever do, is to bring a soul to Jesus, or to
convert a sinner from the error of his way. Here is an illustration
of the way in which this may be done by prayer and effort combined:

"The Coachman and His Prayer." "I was riding once, on the top of a
stage-coach," said a Christian gentleman, "when the driver by my side
began to swear in a dreadful manner. I lifted up my heart for God's
blessing on what I said; and presently, in a quiet way, I asked him
this question: 'Driver, do you ever pray?' He seemed displeased at
first; but after awhile he replied, 'I sometimes go to church on
Sunday; and then I suppose I pray, don't I?' 'I am afraid you never
pray at all; for no man can swear as you do, and yet be in the habit
of praying to God.'

"As we rode along he seemed thoughtful. 'Coachman, I wish you would
pray now,' I said. '"Why, what a time to pray, Sir, when a man is
driving a coach!"' 'Yet, my friend, God will hear you,' '"What shall
I pray?"' he asked, in a low voice. 'Pray these words: '"O Lord,
grant me thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake. Amen."' He hesitated,
but in a moment he repeated them; and then, at my request, he said
them over a second, and a third time. The end of the journey was
reached, and I left him.

"Some months passed away, and we met once more. 'Ah, Sir,' said he,
with a smile, 'the prayer you taught me on that coach-box was
answered. I saw myself a lost, and ruined sinner; but now, I humbly
hope, that through the blood which cleanseth from all sin, and by the
power of the Holy Spirit, I am a converted man.'"

And so, when we think of the twelve apostles, appointed by Jesus to
preach his gospel, these are the four things for us to remember in
connection with them, viz.:--_the men_ whom he chose; _the work_ they
had to do; _the help_ given them in doing that work; and _the lesson_
we are taught by this subject--the lesson of prayer.

Whatever we have to do, let us do it with all our hearts, and do it
as for God, and then we shall be his apostles--his sent ones. Let me
put the application of this subject in the form of some earnest,
practical lines that I lately met with. The lines only speak of
boys, but they apply just as well to girls. They are headed:

DRIVE THE NAIL.

  "Drive the nail aright, boys,
    Hit it on the head,
  Strike with all your might, boys,
    While the iron's red.

  "Lessons you've to learn, boys,
    Study with a will;
  They who reach the top, boys,
    First must climb the hill.

  "Standing at the foot, boys,
    Gazing at the sky,
  How can you get up, boys,
    If you never try?

  "Though you stumble oft, boys,
    Never be downcast;
  Try and try again, boys,
    You'll succeed at last.

  "Ever persevere, boys,
    Tho' your task be hard;
  Toil and happy cheer, boys,
    Bring their own reward.

  "Never give it up, boys,
    Always say you'll try;
  Joy will fill your cup, boys,
    Flowing by and by."


THE GREAT TEACHER


Teaching was the great business of the life of Christ during the days
of his public ministry. He was _sent_ to teach and to preach. The
speaker in the book of Job was thinking of this Great Teacher when he
asked--"_Who teacheth like him_?" Job xxxvi: 22. And it was he who
was in the Psalmist's mind when he spoke of the "good, and upright
Lord" who would teach sinners, if they were meek, how to walk in his
ways. Ps. xxv: 8-9. And he is the Redeemer, of whom the prophet
Isaiah was telling when he said--He would "_teach us to profit_, and
_would lead us by the way that we should go_." And thus we know how
true was what Nicodemus said of him, that "he was a _teacher sent
from God_." John iii: 2. Thus what was said of Jesus, before he came
into our world, would naturally lead us to expect to find him
occupied in teaching. And so he _was_ occupied, all through the days
of his public ministry. St. Matthew tells us that--"Jesus went about
all Galilee, _teaching_ in their synagogues." Ch. iv: 23. Further on
in his gospel he tells us again that "Jesus went about all the
cities, and villages, teaching in their synagogues." Ch. ix: 35. When
on his trial before Pilate, his enemies brought it as a charge
against him that he had been--"_teaching_ throughout all Jewry." Luke
xxiii: 5. We read in one place that--"the elders of the people came
unto him _as he was teaching_." Matt. xxi: 23. Jesus himself gave
this account of his life work to his enemies--"I sat _daily_ with you
_teaching_ in the temple." Matt. xxvi: 55. And so we come now to look
at the life of Christ from this point of view--as a Teacher. There
never was such a Teacher. We do not wonder at the effect of his
teaching of which we read in St. John vii: 46, when the chief priests
sent some of their officers to take him prisoner, and bring him unto
them; the officers went, and joined the crowd that was listening to
his preaching. His words had such a strange effect on them that they
could not think of touching him. So they went back to their masters
without doing what they had been sent to do. "And when the chief
priests and Pharisees said unto them--Why have ye not brought him?
The officers answered, _Never man spake like this man_." Jesus was
indeed--_The Great Teacher_. In this light we are now to look at him.
And as we do this we shall find that there were _five_ great things
about his teaching which made him different from any other teacher
the world has ever known.

_In the first place Jesus may well be called the Great Teacher,
because of the_--GREAT BLESSINGS--_of which he came to tell_.

We find some of these spoken of at the opening of his first great
sermon to his disciples, called "The Sermon on the Mount." This is
the most wonderful sermon that ever was preached. Jesus began it by
telling about some of the great blessings he had brought down from
heaven for poor sinful creatures such as we are. The sermon begins in
the fifth chapter of St. Matthew, and the first twelve verses of the
chapter are occupied in speaking of these blessings. As soon as he
opened his mouth and began to speak a stream of blessings flowed out.

It was a beautiful thought, on this subject, which a boy in
Sunday-school once had. The teacher had been talking to his class
about the beginning of this sermon on the mount. He had spoken of the
sweetness of the words of Jesus, when "He opened his mouth and
taught" his disciples. "How pleasant it must have been, my dear
boys," said he, "to have seen the blessed Saviour, and to have heard
him speak!"

A serious-minded little fellow in the class said, "Teacher, don't you
think that when Jesus opened his mouth, and began to speak to his
disciples, it must have been like taking the stopper out of a scent
bottle?" I cannot tell whether this boy had ever read the words of
Solomon or not; but he had just the same idea that was in his mind
when he said of this "Great Teacher," "thy name is _as ointment
poured forth_." Cant, i: 3. We perceive the fragrance of this
ointment as soon as Jesus opens his mouth and begins to speak. If we
had been listening to Jesus when he began this sermon, saying:--"
Blessed are the poor in spirit; blessed are the meek; blessed are the
pure in heart; blessed are the peace-makers"--and so on till he had
spoken of _nine_ different kinds of blessing, we might have thought
that he had nothing but blessings of which to tell. It would have
seemed as if his mind, and heart, and lips, and hands were all so
filled with blessings that he could do nothing else till he had told
about these. And the blessings spoken of here are not all the
blessings that Jesus brought. They are only specimens of them. The
blessings he has obtained for us are innumerable. David says of them,
"If I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be
numbered." Ps. xl: 5. And these blessings are not only very numerous,
but very _great_. Look at one or two of these blessings that Jesus,
the Great Teacher, brings to us. He says, "Blessed are they that
mourn, for they shall be comforted." Jesus came to bring comfort to
the mourners. Hundreds of years before Christ came the prophet Isaiah
had said of him that he would come to "_comfort all that mourn_." Is.
lxi: 2. And to show how complete this blessing would be which he was
to bring, Jesus said himself--"_As one whom his mother comforteth_
--_so will I comfort you_." Is. lxvi: 13. A young girl was dying.
A friend who came in to see her said:

"I trust you have a good hope."

"No," she answered, distinctly; "I am not hoping--I am certain. My
salvation was finished on the cross. My soul is saved. Heaven is
mine. I am going to Jesus."

What a great blessing it is to have comfort like that!

When Jesus was speaking to the woman of Samaria, as he sat by Jacob's
well, he compared the blessing of his grace to the water of that
well. Pointing to the well at his side, he said: "Whosoever drinketh
of this water will thirst again. But whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him, shall be _in him, a well of water, springing up unto
everlasting life_." John iv: 13, 14. This is one of the most
beautiful illustrations of the blessing Jesus gives that ever was
used. It is a great blessing to have a well of clear, cold water in
our garden, or near our door. But, only think of having a well of
water _in our hearts_. Then, wherever we go, we carry that well with
us. We never have to go away from it. No one can separate between us
and the water of this well. Other wells dry up and fail. But this is
a well that never dries up, and never fails. This well is deep, and
its water is all the time "springing up unto everlasting life." How
happy they are in whose breasts Jesus opens this well of water!

Coleridge, the English poet, in writing to a young friend, just
before his death, said:

"Health is a great blessing; wealth, gained by honest industry, is a
great blessing; it is a great blessing to have kind, faithful, loving
friends and relatives, _but, the greatest, and best of all blessings
is to be a Christian_."

One of the most able and learned lawyers that England ever had was
John Selden. He was so famous for his learning and knowledge that he
is always spoken of as "the learned Selden." On his deathbed he
said--"I have taken much pains to know everything that was worth
knowing among men; but with all my reading and all my knowledge,
nothing now remains with me to comfort me at the close of life but
these precious words of St. Paul: 'This a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners;' to this I cling. In this I rest. This gives me peace, and
comfort, and enables me to die happy."

William Wilberforce was another of the great and good men who have
been a blessing and an honor to England. When he was on his deathbed,
he said to a dear friend:

"Come, let us talk of heaven. Do not weep for me. I am very happy.
But I never knew what happiness was till I found Christ as my
Saviour. Read the Bible. Let no other book take its place. Through
all my trials and perplexities, it has been my comfort. And now it
comforts me, and makes me happy."

Here we see "this well of water springing up unto everlasting life."
And Jesus, who came to tell us of this water, and to open up this
well in our breasts, may well be called, "the Great Teacher," because
of the great blessings--of which he tells.

_In the second place Jesus may be called "the Great Teacher" because
of the_--GREAT SIMPLICITY--_of his teachings_.

I do not mean to say that we can understand every thing that Jesus
taught. This is not so. He had some things to speak about that are
not simple. He said to his disciples, "_I have yet many things to say
unto you, but ye cannot bear them now_." John xvi: 12. This means
that there are some things about God, and heaven, of which he wished
to tell them, but they were too hard for them to understand, although
they were full-grown men. And so he did not tell them of these
things. But even among the things that Jesus did tell about, there
are some which the wisest and most learned men in the world have
never been able to understand or explain. Some one has compared the
Bible to a river, in which there are some places deep enough for an
elephant or a giant to swim in; and other places where the water is
shallow enough for a child to wade in. And it is just so with the
teachings of Jesus. Some of the most important lessons he taught are
so plain and simple that very young people can understand them.

We have a good illustration of this in that sweet invitation which
Jesus gave when he said,--"_Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest._" Matt. xi: 28. Very young
people know what it is to feel tired and weary from walking, or
working too much, or from carrying a heavy burden. And, when they are
too tired to do anything else, they know what it is to go to their
dear mother and throw themselves into her arms, and find rest there.
And, in just the same way, Jesus invites us to come to him when we
are tired, or troubled, that our souls may find rest in him. We come
to Jesus, when we pray to him; when we tell him all about our
troubles; when we ask him to help us; and when we trust in his
promises.

  "Was there ever gentlest shepherd
    Half so gentle, half so sweet,
  As the Saviour, who would have us
    Come and gather round his feet?

  "There's a wideness in God's mercy,
    Like the wideness of the sea;
  There's a kindness in his justice
    Which is more than liberty.

  "There is no place where earth's sorrows
    Are more felt than up in heaven;
  There is no place where earth's failings
    Have such kindly judgments given.

  "There is plentiful redemption
    In the blood that has been shed;
  There is joy for all the members
    In the sorrows of the head.

  "If our love were but more simple,
    We should take him at his word;
  And our lives would all be sunshine,
    In the sweetness of our Lord."

The prophet Isaiah foretold that when Jesus came, he would teach his
doctrines to children just weaned. Chap. xxviii: 9. This shows us
that his teaching was to be marked by great plainness and simplicity.
And this was just the way in which he did teach when he uttered those
loving words:--"_Suffer the little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God._" Mark x: 14.
None of the other famous teachers known to the world ever took such
interest in children as Jesus did. And none of them ever taught with
such great simplicity. What multitudes of young people have been led
to love and serve Jesus by thinking of the sweet words he spoke about
children!

"The Child's Gospel." A little girl sat still in church listening to
the minister. She could not understand what he was saying till he
quoted these words of Jesus about the children. But she understood
them. She felt that they were words spoken for her. They made her
feel very happy. And when she went home she threw her arms around her
mother's neck, who had been kept at home by sickness, and said, "O,
mother, I have heard the _child's gospel_ to-day."

"It's For Me." Little Carrie was a heathen child, about ten years
old. After she had been going to the Mission School for some time,
her teacher noticed, one day, that she looked sad.

"Carrie, my dear," she said, "why do you look so sad to-day?"

"Because I am thinking."

"And what are you thinking about?"

"O, teacher, I don't know whether Jesus loves me, or not."

"Carrie, what did Jesus say about little children coming to him when
he was on earth?"

In a moment the sweet words she had learned in the school were on her
lips--"Suffer the little children to come unto me, &c."

"Well, Carrie, for whom did Jesus speak these words?" At once she
clapped her hands and exclaimed: "It's not for you, teacher, is it?
for you are not a child. No: it's for me! it's for me!"

And so this dear child was drawn to Jesus by the power of his love.
And thus, through all the hundreds of years that have passed away
since "Jesus was here among men," these same simple words have been
drawing the little ones to him.

And so, because of the great simplicity which marked his teaching,
Jesus must truly be called--the Great Teacher.

_But in the third place there was_--GREAT TENDERNESS--_in Jesus, and
this was another thing that helped to make him the Great Teacher_.

It was this great tenderness that led him, when he came to be our
Teacher and Saviour to take our nature upon him and so become like
us. He might have come into our world in the form of a mighty angel,
with his face shining like the sun, as he appeared when the disciples
saw him on the Mount of Transfiguration. But then we should have been
afraid of him. He would not have known how we feel, and could not
have felt for us. But instead of this, his tenderness led him to take
our nature upon him, that he might be able to put himself in our
place, and so to understand just how we feel, and what we need to
help and comfort us. This is what the apostle means in Heb. ii: 14,
when he says--"Forasmuch as the children were partakers of flesh and
blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same." He did this
on purpose that he might know, by his own experience, how we are
tried and tempted; and so be able to sympathize with us and help us
in all our trials.

Here is a little story, very simple, and homely; but yet, one that
illustrates very well the point of which we are speaking. It is a
story about:

"A Lost Horse Found." A valuable horse was lost, belonging to a
farmer in New England. A number of his neighbors turned out to try
and find the horse. They searched all through the woods and fields
of the surrounding country, but in vain. None of them could find the
horse. At last a poor, weak-minded fellow, who was known in that
neighborhood as "simple Sam," started to hunt the horse. After awhile
he came back, bringing the stray horse with him. The owner of the
horse was delighted to see him. He stroked and patted him, and then,
turning to the simple-minded man who had found him, he said:

"Well, Sam, how came you to find the horse, when no one else could do
it?"

"Wal, you see," said Sam, "I just 'quired whar the horse was seen
last; and then I went thar, and sat on a rock; and just axed mysel',
if I was a horse, whar would I go, and what would I do? And then I
went, and found him." Now, when Sam, in the simplicity of his feeble
mind, tried to put himself, as far as he could, in the horse's place,
this helped him to find the lost horse, and bring him back to his
owner again. And so, to pass from a very little thing to a very great
one, when Jesus came down from heaven to seek and to save sinners
that were lost, this is just the way in which he acted. He put
himself in our place as sinners. As the apostle Paul says: "he who
knew no sin, was made sin for us," that he might save us from the
dreadful consequences of our sins.

And we see the tenderness of Jesus, not only in taking our nature
upon him and becoming man, but in what he did when he lived in this
world as a man. "_He went about doing good_." It was his great
tenderness that led him to do this. Suppose that you and I could have
walked about with Jesus when he was on earth as the apostles did.
Just think for a moment what we should have seen. We should have seen
him meeting with blind men and opening their eyes that they might
see. We should have seen him meeting with deaf men, and unstopping
their ears that they might hear. We should have seen him meeting sick
people who were taken with divers diseases and torments and healing
them. We should have seen him raising the dead; and casting out
devils; and speaking words of comfort and encouragement to those who
were sad and sorrowful. If we could have looked into his blessed
face, we should have seen tenderness there, beaming from his eyes and
speaking from every line of his countenance. If we could have
listened to his teaching we should have found tenderness running
through all that he said. Just take one of his many parables as a
sample of his way of teaching--the parable of the lost sheep--and see
how full of tenderness it is. The sweet lines of the hymn, about the
shepherd seeking his lost sheep, that most of us love to sing, bring
out the tenderness of Jesus here very touchingly.

  "There were ninety and nine that safely lay
    In the shelter of the fold,
  But one was out on the hills away,
    Far off from the gates of gold--
  Away on the mountains, wild and bare,
  Away from the tender shepherd's care.

  "'Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
    Are they not enough for Thee?'
  But the Shepherd made answer: 'One of mine
    Has wandered away from me;
  And, although the road be rough and steep,
  I go to the desert to find my sheep.'

  "But none of the ransomed ever knew
    How deep were the waters crossed;
  Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through,
    Ere he found his sheep that was lost.
  Out in the desert he heard its cry--
  Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

  "'Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way
    That mark out the mountain's track?'
  They were shed for one who had gone astray,
    Ere the shepherd could bring him back.
  'Lord, why are Thy hands so rent and torn?'
  They are pierced, to-night, by many a thorn.

  "But all through the mountains, thunder-riven,
    And up from the rocky steep,
  There rose a cry to the gates of heaven,
    'Rejoice! I have found my sheep!'
  And the angels echoed around the throne,
  'Rejoice, for the Lord brings back his own.'"

And all that we know of Jesus as "the good Shepherd," demonstrates
his great tenderness for his sheep.

But perhaps there was no act in all the life of our blessed Redeemer
that showed his tenderness more than taking the little children in
his arms, and putting his hands upon them, and blessing them.

To think of the Son of God, who made this world, and all worlds, and
whom all the angels of heaven worship, showing so much interest in
the little ones; this proves how full of tenderness his heart was.

"I Like Your Jesus." An English lady who had spent six months in
Syria, writes: "Going through the places where the Mohammedans live,
you continually hear the girls singing our beautiful hymns in Arabic.
The attractive power of Christ's love is felt even by the little
ones, as we learned from a dear Moslem child, who, when she repeated
the text, 'Suffer the little children,' said, 'I like your Jesus,
because he loved little children. Our Mohammed did not love little
children.'"

And if we all try to imitate the tenderness of Jesus, then, though we
may have no money to give, and no great thing to do, yet by being
tender, and gentle, and loving, as Jesus was, we shall be able to do
good wherever we are.

"Doing Good by Sympathy." A Christian mother used to ask her children
every night if they had done any good during the day. One night in
answer to this question, her little daughter said: "At school this
morning I found little Annie G----, who had been absent for some
time, crying very hard. I asked her what was the matter? Then she
cried more, so that I could not help putting my head on her neck, and
crying with her. Her sobs grew less, and presently she told of her
little baby brother, whom she loved so much; how sick he had been;
and how much pain he had suffered, till he died and was buried. Then
she hid her face in her book, and cried, as if her heart would break.
I could not help putting my face on the other page of the book, and
crying, too, as hard as she did. After awhile she kissed me, and told
me I had done her good. But, mother, I don't know how I did her good;
_for I only cried with her!_"

Now this little girl was showing the tenderness of Jesus, the Great
Teacher. Nothing in the world could have done that poor sorrowing
child so much good as to have some one cry with her. Sometimes tears
of tenderness are worth more than diamonds. And this is why the Bible
tells us to "weep with them that weep." Rom. xii: 15. Jesus did this
in the tenderness of his loving heart. And this was one of the things
that made him the Great Teacher.

_But then there was_--GREAT KNOWLEDGE--_in Jesus; and this was
another thing that made him great as a teacher_.

If we wish to be good teachers, we must study, and try to understand
the things we expect to teach. If a young man wishes to be a
minister, he must go through college; and then spend three years in
the Divinity School, so that he may understand the great truths of
the Bible, which he is to teach the people who hear him. But Jesus
never went to college, or to a divinity school. And yet he had
greater knowledge about all the things of which he spoke than any
other teacher ever had. We are told in the book of Job that "He is
_perfect_ in knowledge." Job xxxvi: 5. And the apostle Paul tells us
that "in him are hid _all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge_."
Col. ii: 3. This is more than can be said of any man, or any angel.
If we could take all the knowledge of all the best teachers who ever
lived, and give it to one person, it would be as nothing compared to
the knowledge which Jesus, "the Great Teacher" had. He knew all about
heaven; for that had always been his home before he came into our
world. He knew all about God; for, he was "in the bosom of the
Father," John i: 18; and, as he tells us himself, had shared his
glory with him, "before the world was." John xvii: 5. He knew all
about the world we live in, for he made it. John i: 10. He knew all
about all other worlds, for he made them, too. John i: 3; Heb. i: 2.
He knew all about his disciples and every body else in the world, for
he made them all. He saw all they did; he heard all they said; he
knew all they thought, or felt. Wise and learned men have been
studying, and finding out things for hundreds of years, about
geography and natural history--and astronomy;--about light, and heat,
and electricity--and steam--and the telegraph, and many other things.
Jesus knew all about these things when he was on earth. He could have
told about them, if he had seen fit to do so. But he only told us
what it is best for us to know, in order that we might be saved; and
kept back all the rest. The things that Jesus did teach us when he
was here on earth were wonderful; but it is hardly less wonderful to
think of the things that he might have taught us, and yet did not.
When we think of the great knowledge of Jesus, as a Teacher, we are
not surprised that some of those who heard him "wondered at the
gracious words" he spake; or that others asked the question: "Whence
hath this man this knowledge, having never learned?"

Some one has written these sweet lines about Christ as--_The Great
Teacher_:

    "From everything our Saviour saw,
    Lessons of wisdom he could draw;
    The clouds, the colors in the sky;
    The gentle breeze that whispers by;
    The fields all white with waving corn;
    The lilies that the vale adorn;
    The reed that trembles in the wind;
    The tree, where none its fruit could find;
    The sliding sand, the flinty rock,
    That bears unmoved the tempest's shock;
    The thorns that on the earth abound;
    The tender grass that clothes the ground;
    The little birds that fly in air;
    The sheep that need the shepherd's care;
    The pearls that deep in ocean lie;
    The gold that charms the miser's eye;
    The fruitful and the thorny ground;
    The piece of silver lost and found;
    The reaper, with his sheaves returning;
    The gathered tares prepared for burning;
    The wandering sheep brought back with joy;
    The father's welcome for his boy;
    The wedding-feast, prepared in state;
    The foolish virgins' cry, 'too late!'--
    All from his lips some truth proclaim,
    Or learn to tell their Maker's name."

But the difference between Jesus, the Great Teacher, and all other
teachers is seen, not only in the greater knowledge he has of the
things that he teaches, but in this also, that he knows how to make
us understand the lessons he teaches. Here is an incident that
illustrates how well Jesus can do this. We may call it:

"The Well Instructed Boy." A minister of the gospel was travelling
through the wildest part of Ireland. There he met a shepherd's boy,
not more than ten or twelve years old. He was poorly clad, with no
covering on his head, and no shoes or stockings on his feet; but he
looked bright and happy. He had a New Testament in his hand. "Can you
read, my boy?" asked the minister.

"To be sure I can."

"And do you understand what you read?"

"A little."

"Please turn to the third chapter of St. John, and read us a little,"
said the minister. The boy found the place directly, and in a clear
distinct voice, began:

"There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews; the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi."

"What does Rabbi mean?"

"It means a master."

"Right; go on."

"We know thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do these
miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."

"What is a _miracle_?"

"It is a _great wonder_. 'Jesus answered and said unto him, verily,
verily, I say unto thee.'"

"What does _verily_ mean?"

"It means 'indeed.' 'Except a man be born again.'"

"What does that mean?"

"It means a great change, a change of heart."

"Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."

"And what is that kingdom?"

He paused a moment, and with a very serious, thoughtful look, placing
his hand on his bosom, he said, "It is _something here_;" and then,
raising his eyes to heaven, added, "_and something up yonder_." This
poor boy had been taking lessons from "the Great Teacher," and he had
taught him some of the most important things that we can ever learn.
Jesus may well be called "the Great Teacher," because of his great
knowledge.

_But there is one other thing that Jesus has, which helps to make him
"the Great Teacher," and that is_--GREAT POWER.

Other teachers can tell us what we ought to learn, and to do, yet
they have no power to help us learn, or do what they teach. But Jesus
_has_ this power. Let us take a single illustration from many of the
same kind that occurred while he was on earth. One day he was going
about teaching in the streets of Jerusalem. As he went on, he passed
by the office of a man who was gathering taxes for the Roman
government. The persons who did this were called _publicans_. This
man, sitting in his office, was named Matthew. He was busily engaged
in receiving the taxes of the people. It was a very profitable
business. The men engaged in it generally made a great deal of money.
Jesus stopped before the window or door of this office. He beckoned
to Matthew, and simply spoke these two words:--"_Follow me_."

Now, if any other teacher had spoken these words to Matthew, and had
tried to make him quit his business and engage in something else, he
would have said: "No; I can't leave my office. This is all the means
I have of getting a living. The business pays well, and I am not
willing to give it up." But when Jesus spoke to him, he did, at once,
what he was told to do. We read that "He left all, rose up, and
followed him." Matt. ix: 9; Luke v: 28. He became one of the twelve
apostles and wrote the gospel which bears his name. But it was the
great power which Jesus has over the hearts of men that made Matthew
willing to do, at once, what he was told to do.

And the power which Jesus exercised over Matthew, in this case, he
still has, and still uses. And when he is pleased to use this power
the very worst people feel it, and are made good by it. And Jesus,
"the Great Teacher," uses this power sometimes in connection with
very simple things. Here is an illustration. We may call it:

"Saved by a Rose." Some time ago, a Christian gentleman was in the
habit of visiting one of our prisons. It occurred to him, one day,
that it would be a good thing to have a flowering plant in the little
yard connected with each cell. He got permission from the officers of
the prison to do so. He had a bracket fastened to the wall, in each
yard, and a flower pot, with a plant in it, placed on each bracket.
One of these prisoners was worse than all the rest. He was the most
hardened man that had ever been in that prison. His temper was so
violent and obstinate that no one could manage him. The keeper of the
prison was afraid of him, and never liked to go near him. He was such
a disagreeable-looking man that the name given to him in the prison
was "Ugly Greg." A little rose bush was put on the bracket in Ugly
Greg's yard, and the effect produced by it is told in these simple
lines, which some one has written about it:

    "Ugly Greg was the prisoner's name,
    Ugly in face, and in nature the same;
    Stubborn, sullen, and beetle-browed,
    The hardest case in a hardened crowd.
    The sin-set lines in his face were bent
    Neither by kindness nor punishment;
    He hadn't a friend in the prison there,
    And he grew more ugly and didn't care.

    "But some one--blessings on his name!
    Had caused to be placed in that house of shame,
    To relieve the blank of the white-washed wall,
    Flower-pot brackets, with plants on them all.
    Though it seemed but a useless thing to do,
    Ugly Greg's cell had a flower-pot, too,
    And as he came back at the work-day's close,
    He paused, astonished, before a rose.

    "'He will smash it in pieces,' the keeper said,
    But the lines on his face grew soft instead.
    Next morning he watered his plant with care,
    And went to his work with a cheerful air;
    And, day by day, as the rose-bush grew,
    Ugly Greg began changing, too.

    "The soft, green leaves unfolded their tips,
    And the foul word died on the prisoner's lips;
    He talked to the plant, when all alone,
    As he would to a friend, in a gentle tone;
    And, day by day, and week by week,
    As the rose grew taller, so Greg grew meek.

    "But, at last they took him away to lie
    On a hospital bed, for they knew he must die,
    They placed the rose in the sunny light,
    Where Greg might watch it, from morn till night,
    And the green buds grew, from day to day,
    As the sick man faded fast away.

    "The lines which sin and pain had traced,
    Seemed by the shadowing plant effaced,
    Till, came at last, the joyful hour,
    When they knew that the bud must burst its flower.
    Greg slept, but still one hand caressed
    The plant; the other his pale cheek pressed.
    The perfumed crimson shed a glow
    On the old man's hair, as white as snow;
    The nurse came softly--'Look, Greg!' she said,
    Ay, the rose had bloomed, but the man was dead."

And the meaning of all this is, not that the rose itself saved this
hardened sinner. No; but it led him to think of the lessons of his
childhood, when he had been taught about Jesus, "the Rose of
Sharon". It led him to think about his sins. It led him to repent of
them; to pray to Jesus; to exercise faith in him; and in _this way_
he became a changed man, and was saved. And so, though we speak of
him as--"a man saved by a rose;" yet it was the power of Jesus, "the
Great Teacher," exercised through that rose, which led to this
blessed change and saved Greg's soul from death.

And thus we have spoken of five things which help to make up the
greatness of Jesus as a Teacher. These are--The Great Blessings--The
Great Simplicity--The Great Tenderness--The Great Knowledge--and the
Great Power connected with his teachings. Let us seek the grace that
will enable us to learn of him, and then we shall find rest for our
souls!


CHRIST TEACHING BY PARABLES


We have spoken of our Saviour as "The Great Teacher," and tried to
point out some of the things in his teaching which helped to make him
great. And now, it may be well to speak a little of the illustrations
which he made use of as a Teacher. These are called--_parables_. Our
Saviour's parables were illustrations. This is what is meant by the
Greek word from which we get the word parable. It means something
_set down by the side of another_. When we teach a lesson we are
setting something before the minds of our scholars. But suppose it is
a hard lesson and they do not understand it. Then we use an
illustration. This is something set down beside the lesson to make it
plain. Then this, whatever it be, is a parable.

At the beginning of his ministry, our Saviour did not make much use
of parables. But, after he had been preaching for some time, he made
a change in his way of teaching, in this respect. He began to use
parables very freely. His disciples were surprised at this. On one
occasion, after he had used the parable of the Sower, they came to
their Master and asked him why he always spake to the people now in
parables? We have our Saviour's answer to this question in St. Matt,
xiii: 11-18. And it is a remarkable answer. The meaning of it is that
he used parables for two reasons: one was to help those who really
wished to learn from him to understand what he was teaching. The
other was that those who were not willing to be taught might listen
to him without understanding what he was saying. These people had
heard him when he was teaching without parables. But, instead of
thanking him for coming to teach them, and of being willing to do
what he wanted them to do, they found fault with his teaching, and
would not mind what he said.

Now, there is a great difference between the way in which we are to
learn what the Bible teaches us about God and heaven; and the way in
which we learn other things. If we want to learn what the Bible
teaches us we must be careful that we are having right feelings in
our hearts; but if we want to learn other things it does not matter
so much what our feelings are. For instance, suppose you have a
lesson to learn in geography; no matter how you are feeling, whether
you are proud, or humble; whether you are cross, or gentle; yet if
you only study hard enough, and long enough, you can learn that
lesson. But, if you want to learn one of the lessons that Jesus
teaches, no matter how hard, or how long you study it, yet while you
are giving way to proud, or angry feelings in your heart, you can
never learn that lesson. And the reason is that we cannot learn these
lessons unless we have the special help of Jesus, by the Holy Spirit.
But this help can never be had while we give way to wrong feelings in
our hearts. In learning geography, and other such lessons, we do not
need the _special_ help of God. We can learn them ourselves, if we
only try. But we cannot learn the lessons that Jesus teaches in this
way. This is what the Psalmist means when he says:--"The _meek_ will
he teach his way." Ps. xxv: 9. And this was what our Saviour meant
when he said: "If any man will do his will, _he shall know_." St.
John vii: 17. We must be willing to be taught;--and willing to obey;
if we wish to understand what Jesus, "The Great Teacher," has to tell
us.

Some one has well said that truth, taught by a parable, is like the
kernel hid away in a nut. The parable, like the shell of the nut,
covers up the kernel. Those who really want the kernel will crack the
shell, and get it: but those who are not willing to crack the shell
will never get the kernel. The shell of the nut keeps the kernel safe
_for_ one of these persons, and safe _from_ the others.

But, after the time of which we have spoken, Jesus used parables
freely. We are told that--"without a parable spake he not unto the
people." St. Mark xiii: 34. He used parables among his disciples for
two reasons: these were to help them to _understand_, and to remember
what he taught them.

We have a great many of the parables of Jesus in the gospels. A full
list of them will contain not less than _fifty_. It would be easy
enough to make a sermon on each of these parables. But that would
make a larger work than this whole LIFE OF CHRIST, on which we are
now engaged. It is impossible therefore to speak of all the parables.
We can only make selections, or take some specimens of them. We may
speak of five different lessons as illustrated by some of the
parables of Christ. These are--_The value of religion: Christ's love
of sinners: The duty of forgiveness: The duty of kindness: and the
effect of good example_.

_Well then, we may begin by considering what Jesus taught us of_--THE
VALUE OF RELIGION--_in his parables._

The parable of The Treasure Hid in the Field teaches us this truth.
We find this parable in St. Matt. xiii: 44. Here Jesus says, "The
kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which
when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field." The words "kingdom
of heaven" are used by our Saviour in different senses. Sometimes, as
here, they mean the grace of God, or true religion. And what Jesus
teaches us by this parable is that true religion is more valuable
than anything else in the world.

The next parable, in the forty-fifth and forty-sixth verses of the
same chapter, is about The Pearl of Great Price. This teaches the
same lesson. It reads thus:--"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a
merchantman seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl
of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it." By this
"pearl of great price" Jesus meant true religion, as he did by the
treasure hid in the field in the former parable. And the truth he
teaches in both these parables is that religion is more important to
us than anything else in the world. Let us look at some incidents
that may help to illustrate for us the value of religion.

"Jesus Makes Everything Right." A poor lame boy became a Christian,
and in telling what effect this change had upon him, these are the
words he used to a person who was visiting him: "Once every thing
went wrong at our house; father was wrong, mother was wrong, sister
was wrong, and I was wrong; but now, since I have learned to know and
love Jesus it is all right. I know why everything went wrong
before:--it was because I was wrong myself." And this is true. The
first thing that religion does for us is to make us _be_ right
ourselves, and then to _do_ right to others.

"Be." A young lady had been trying to do something very good, but had
not succeeded. Her mother said, "Marian, my child, God gives us many
things to _do_, but we must not forget that he gives us some things
to _be_; and we must learn to _be_ what God would have us be, before
we can _do_ what God would have us do."

"Shut yure eyes, and don't you peek!" Den ay feel his arms around me
And his kisses on my cheek.

"Now ay'm hiding, dad," he tal me!
"Maybe, ef you look some more, Yu skol find yure little Olaf-- Ay
ban back of kitchen door."

"Peek-a-boo!" ay hear him calling, Lak he called long time ago.

Var ban little Olaf hiding?

Maybe anyel fallers know.

Tousand times ay look to find him Hiding back of kitchen door, But
ay only see some shadows:
Ay can't find him any more.

"Now," she tal him, "yust be careful,... ay skol fix it op all

Let us
look at one or two incidents that illustrate this.

"A Boy's Influence." Two families lived in one house. In each of
these families there was a little boy about the same age. These boys
slept together. One of them had a good pious mother. She had trained
him to kneel down every night, before getting into bed, and say his
prayer in an audible voice, and to repeat a text of scripture which
she had taught him. Now the first time he slept with the other little
boy, who never said any prayers, he was tempted to jump into bed, as
his companion did, without kneeling down to pray. But he was a brave
and noble boy. He said to himself--"I am not afraid to do what my
mother taught me. I am not ashamed for anybody to know that I pray to
God. I'll do as I have been taught to do." He did so. He let his
light shine. And see what followed from its shining!

The little boy who had never been taught to pray learned his
companion's prayer, and the verse he repeated, by hearing them, and
he never forgot them. He grew up to be an earnest Christian man. When
he lay on his deathbed, quite an aged man, he sent for the friend,
whose prayer he had learned, to come and see him, and told him that
it was his little prayer, so faithfully said every night when they
were boys, which led him to become a Christian. He repeated the
prayer and the verse, word for word, and with his dying lips thanked
his friend for letting his light shine as he did, for _that_ had
saved his soul.

Here is another illustration of a Christian letting his light shine
and the good that was done by it. We may call it:

"The Shilling Bible, and what Came of It." Some years ago a
Christian gentleman went on a visit for three days to the house of a
rich lady who lived at the west end of London. After tea, on the
first evening of his arrival, he called one of the servants, and
telling her that in the hurry of leaving home he had forgotten to
bring a Bible with him, he requested her to ask the lady of the house
to be kind enough to lend him one.

Now that house was beautifully furnished. There were splendid
pictures on the walls, and elegantly bound volumes in the library and
on the tables in the parlor; but there was not a Bible in the house.
The lady felt ashamed to own that she had no Bible. So she gave the
servant a shilling and told her to go to the book store round the
corner and buy a Bible. The Bible was bought and given to the
gentleman. He used it during his visit, and then went home, little
knowing how much good that shilling Bible was to do.

When he was gone the lady at whose house he had been staying said to
herself:

"How strange it is that an intelligent gentleman like my friend could
not bear to go for three days without reading the Bible, while I
never read it at all, and don't know what it teaches. I am curious
to know what there is in this book to make it so attractive. I mean
to begin and read it through." She began to read it at first out of
simple curiosity. But, as she went on reading she became deeply
interested in it. It showed her what a sinner she was in living
without God in the world. It led her to pray earnestly for the pardon
of her sins; and the end of it was that she became a Christian. Then
she desired that her children should know and love the Saviour too.
She prayed for them. She talked with them, and taught them the
precious truths contained in that blessed book. And the result was
that, one by one, they were all led to Jesus and became Christians.
And so _that whole family were saved by means of that shilling
Bible_.

When that gentleman asked for the use of a Bible in the house where
he was visiting, he was setting a good example. He was putting his
candle on a candlestick and letting it shine. And the result that
followed gives us a good illustration of the meaning of our Saviour's
words when he said:--"Let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven."

And so, when we remember the parables that Jesus taught, among other
things illustrated by them, we can think of these,--_the value of
religion;--Christ's love for sinners;--the duty of kindness;--the
duty of forgiveness;--the influence of a good example_.

I know not how to finish this subject better than in the words of the
hymn:

  "Father of mercies! in thy word,
    What endless glory shines!
  Forever be thy name adored
    For these celestial lines.
  O, may these heavenly pages be
    My ever dear delight;
  And still new beauties may I see,
    And still increasing light."


CHRIST TEACHING BY MIRACLES


We have seen how many valuable lessons our Saviour taught while on
earth by the parables which he used. But we teach by our lives, as
well as by our lips. It has passed into a proverb, and we all admit
the truth of it, that "Actions speak louder than words." If our words
and our actions contradict each other, people will believe our
actions sooner than our words. But when both agree together, then the
effect is very great. This was true with our blessed Lord. There was
an entire agreement between what he said, and what he did. His words
and his actions, the teaching of his lips, and the teaching of his
life--were in perfect harmony. He practised what he preached.

But then, in addition to the every day common actions of the life of
Christ, there were actions in it that were very uncommon. He was
daily performing miracles, and doing many mighty and wonderful
works. And the prophets before him, and apostles after him, performed
miracles too; yet there were two things in which the miracles of
Christ differed from those performed by others. One was as to the
_number_ of them. He did a greater number of wonderful things than
anyone else ever did. Indeed if we take the miracles that were done
by Moses, by Elijah and Elisha, in the Old Testament, and those that
were done by the apostles in the New Testament and put them all
together we shall find that they would not equal, in number, the
miracles of Christ. There are between thirty and forty of the mighty
works wrought by our Saviour mentioned in the gospels. And these, as
St. John says, are only a small portion of them. Ch. xxi: 25.

The other thing in which the miracles of Christ are different from
those performed by other persons, is _the way in which they were
done_. The prophets and apostles did their mighty works in the name
of God, or of Christ. Thus when Peter and John healed the lame man at
the gate of the temple they said:--"_In the name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth_, rise up and walk." Acts iii: 6. But Jesus had all the
power in himself by which those wonderful things were done. He could
say to the leper,--"_I will_; be thou clean." He could say to the
sick man:--"Take up thy bed and walk." When speaking of his death and
resurrection, he could very well say that it was his own power which
would control it all. His life was in his own hands. It was true, as
he said, "No man taketh it from me; but I lay it down of myself. I
have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again." John x:
18. And it was the same with all his other mighty works. He had all
the power in himself that was needed to do them.

And these miracles of Christ were the proofs that he was the Messiah,
the great Saviour, of whom the prophets had spoken. This was what
Nicodemus meant when he said to Jesus:--"We know that thou art a
teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou
doest, except God be with him." John iii: 2. And Jesus himself
referred to his miracles as the proof that God had sent him. John v:
36; x: 25.

And this was what he meant by the message which he sent to John the
Baptist, when his disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Are thou he that
should come, or look we for another?" Jesus answered and said unto
them, "Go, and show John again those things which ye do hear and see;
the blind receive their sight; and the lame walk; the lepers are
cleansed; and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up; and the poor
have the gospel preached unto them." Matt, xi: 2-6. These were the
very things which the prophets had foretold that Christ would do when
he came. Is. xxix: 18. xxxv: 4-6. xlii: 7.

It is clear from these passages that all the miracles performed by
our Lord were intended to teach this lesson, that he was the great
Saviour of whom the prophets had spoken. But then, in addition to
this, these wonderful works of Jesus were made use of by him to show
that he has power to do everything for his people that they may need
to have him do.

It is impossible for us to speak of all the miracles of Christ. We
can only make selections from them, as we did with the parables in
the last chapter. In looking at these we may see Jesus teaching us
that he has power to do _four_ things for his people.

_In the first place some of the miracles of Christ teach us that he
has great power to_--HELP.

We see this in the account given us of the miraculous draught of
fishes. Luke v: 1-11.

Peter was a fisherman before he became a disciple of Jesus. And James
and John, the sons of Zebedee, were partners with him in the same
business. On one occasion they had been busy all night throwing out
and hauling in their nets, but without catching a single fish. Early
the next morning, Jesus was walking along the shore of the lake, near
where their boats were. He knew how tired and discouraged they were,
and how much they needed help; and he wished to show them what
wonderful power he had to help in time of need. So he told them to
cast their net on the other side of the ship. They did so; and
immediately their nets were full; and they had more fish than they
could well manage. Here we are taught that even in the depths of the
sea nothing can be hid from the all-seeing eye of our divine Saviour.
He knows where everything is that his people can need; and he has the
power to bring it to them.

And then, by his miracle of walking on the sea Jesus taught the same
lesson. We have an account of this miracle in three places. Matt,
xix: 22-33. Mark vi: 45-52. John vi: 14-21.

At the close of a busy day, in which he had been teaching the people
and feeding them by miracle, Jesus told his disciples to go on board
a vessel and cross over to the other side of the lake. Then he sent
the multitude away, and went up into the mountain to pray to his
Father in heaven whom he loved so much. It proved to be a stormy
night. The wind was dead ahead; and the sea was very rough. The
disciples were having a hard time of it. Tired of rowing, and making
little progress, there was no prospect of their getting to land
before morning. But, dark as the night was, Jesus saw them. It is
true as David says, that--"_The darkness and the light are both alike
to thee._" Ps. cxxxix: 12. He saw they needed help and he resolved to
give it to them. But there was no boat at hand for him to go in.
True: but he needed none. He could walk on the water as well as on
the land. He steps from the sandy shore to the surface of the
storm-tossed sea. He walks safely over its troubled waters. The
disciples see him. Supposing it to be a spirit, they are alarmed, and
cry out in their fear. But presently the cheering voice of their
Master comes to them, saying: "_It is I. Be not afraid_." He steps on
board. The wind ceases, and immediately, without another stroke of
the oars, the mighty power of Jesus brings them "in safety to the
haven where they would be." Other miracles might be referred to as
teaching the same lesson. But these are sufficient. And Jesus has the
same power to help now that he had then.

Here are some illustrations of the strange way in which he sometimes
helps his people in their times of need.

"The Dead Raven." A poor weaver in Edinburgh lost his situation one
winter, on account of business being so dull. He begged earnestly of
his employer to let him have work; but he said it was impossible.
Well said he, "I'm sure the Lord will help." When he came home and
told his wife the sad news she was greatly distressed. He tried to
comfort her with the assurance--"The Lord will help." But as he could
get no work, their money was soon gone; and the day came at last,
when there was neither food nor fuel left in the house. The last
morsel of bread was eaten one morning at breakfast. "What shall we do
for dinner?" asked his wife.

"The Lord will help"--was still his reply. And see how the help came.
Soon after breakfast, his wife opened the front window, to dust off
the sill. Just then a rude boy, who was passing, threw a dead raven
in through the window. It fell at the feet of the pious weaver. As
he threw the bird in, the boy cried out in mockery, "There, old
saint, is something for you to eat." The weaver took up the dead
raven, saying as he did so:--"Poor creature! you must have died of
hunger!"

But when he felt its crop to see whether it was empty, he noticed
something hard in it. And wishing to know what had caused its death,
he took a knife and cut open its throat. How great was his
astonishment on doing this, to find a small diamond bracelet fall
into his hand! His wife gazed at it in amazement. "Didn't I tell
you," he asked, in grateful gladness, "that the Lord will help?"

He went to the nearest jeweler's, and telling how he had found the
precious jewels, borrowed some money on them. On making inquiry about
it, it turned out that the bracelet belonged to the wife of the good
weaver's late employer. It had suddenly disappeared from her chamber.
One of the servants had been charged with stealing it, and had been
dismissed. On hearing how the bracelet had disappeared, and how
strangely it had fallen into the hands of his late worthy workman,
the gentleman was very much touched; and not only rewarded him
liberally for returning it--but took him back into his employ, and
said he should never want work again so long as he had any to give.

How willing, and how able our glorious Saviour is to help those who
trust in him!

"The Sailor Boy's Belief." One night there was a terrible storm at
sea. All at once a ship, which was tossing on the waves, keeled over
on her beam ends. "She'll never right again!" exclaimed the captain.
"We shall all be lost!"

"Not at all, sir!" cried a pious sailor boy who was near the captain.
"What's to hinder it?" asked the captain. "Why you see, sir," said
the boy, "they are praying at this very moment in the Bethel ship at
Glasgow for all sailors in danger: and I feel sure that God will hear
their prayers: Now see, sir, if he don't!"

These words were hardly out of the boy's mouth, before a great wave
struck the ship, and set her right up again. And then a shout of
praise, louder than the howling of the storm, went up to God from the
deck of that saved ship.

And so, in the miracles that he performed, one thing that Jesus
taught was his power to help.

_In the next place, among the miracles of Christ, we find some that
were performed in order to teach us his power to_--COMFORT.

One day, a great multitude of people waited on Jesus from morning
till evening, to listen to his preaching. They were so anxious to
hear that even when hungry they would not go away to get food. As the
evening came on, the disciples asked their master to send the people
away to get something to eat. But Jesus told them to give the people
food. They said they had only five loaves and two fishes. Jesus told
them to make the people sit down on the grass. And when they were
seated he took the loaves and blessed, and brake them, and gave them
to the disciples, and they gave them to the people. And great as that
multitude was the supply did not fail. This was wonderful! Those
loaves were very small. They were not bigger than a good-sized roll.
The whole of the five loaves and two fishes would not have been
enough to make a meal for a dozen men. And yet they were made
sufficient to feed more than five thousand hungry people. How strange
this was! The mighty power of Jesus did it. We are not told just
_where_, in the interesting scene, this wonder-working power was put
forth. It may have been that as Jesus brake the loaves and gave the
pieces to the disciples, the part left in his hands grew out at once,
to the same size that it was before. Or the broken pieces may have
increased and multiplied while the disciples were engaged in
distributing them. It is most likely that the miracle took place in
immediate connection with Jesus himself. The power that did it was
his: and in his hands, we may suppose that the wonderful work was
done. As fast as he broke the loaves they increased, till all the
people were fed. This was indeed not _one_ miracle, but a multitude
of miracles, all performed at once. The hungry multitude ate till all
were satisfied: and yet the fragments left filled twelve baskets.
Five thousand men were fed, and then there was twelve times as much
food left as there was before they began to eat. All this was done to
satisfy that hungry crowd, and to teach them, and us, what power this
glorious Saviour has to comfort those who are in need or trouble.

And when he healed the daughter of the Syrophoenician woman, as we
read in St. Matt, xii: 21-28; when he healed the lunatic child, as we
read in St. Matt, xvii: 14-21; and when he raised Lazarus from the
dead, after he had lain four days in the grave, as we read in St.
John xi: 1-54, he was working miracles to show his power to comfort
those in trouble.

And we see him using his power still to comfort persons who are in
distress. Here are some illustrations of the way in which he does
this:

"Shining in Every Window." A Christian lady, who spent much time in
visiting among the poor, went one day to see a poor young girl, who
was kept at home by a broken limb. Her room was on the north side of
the house. It did not look pleasant without or cheerful within. "Poor
girl!" she said to herself, "what a dreary time she must have!" On
entering her room she said:

"I am sorry, my friend, that your room is not on the other side of
the house, where the sun could shine upon you. You never can have any
sunshine here."

"Oh, you are mistaken," she said: "the sunshine pours in at every
window, and through every crack."

The lady looked surprised.

"I mean Jesus, 'the Sun of righteousness,' shines in here, and makes
everything bright to me."

Here we see Jesus showing his power to comfort.

"Ice in Summer." Some years ago a Christian merchant, in one of our
eastern cities, failed in business, and lost everything he had. After
talking over their affairs with his wife, who was a good Christian
woman, they concluded to move out to the west and begin life again
there. He bought some land on the wide rolling prairie, built a log
cabin, and began to cultivate his farm. In the midst of the second
summer, hard work and exposure to the sun brought on an attack of
sickness, and a raging fever set in. They were twelve miles away from
the nearest town. One of the neighbors went there and came back with
a doctor. He examined the case very carefully, and left some medicine
with them, and told them what to do. He said it was a very dangerous
attack. If they could only get some ice to apply to the burning brow
of the sick man, he thought he might get over it; but, without that,
there was very little prospect of his recovery.

As soon as the doctor was gone, the sorrowful wife gathered her
family and friends round the bedside of her sick husband, and kneeled
down with them in prayer. She told God what the doctor had said, and
prayed very earnestly that he who has the power to do everything,
would send them some ice.

When the prayer was over, some of the neighbors whispered to each
other that the poor distressed woman must be losing her mind. "The
idea of getting ice here," they said, "when everybody knows there
isn't a bit of ice in all the country! It would be contrary to all
the laws of nature to have ice in summer."

The wife of the sick man heard their remarks, but they did not shake
her faith in God, and in the power of prayer. Silently, but
earnestly, her heart breathed forth the cry for ice.

As the day wore on, heavy clouds began to gather in the western sky.
They rolled in darkness over the heavens. The distant thunder was
heard to mutter. Nearer and louder it was heard. The lightning began
to flash. Presently the storm burst in its fury. It came first in
rain, and then in hail. The hail-stones came in lumps of ice as big
as eggs. They lay thick in the furrows of the field. The thankful
wife went out, and soon came in rejoicing with a bucket full of ice.
It was applied in bags to her husband's head. The fever broke, and he
was restored to life and health.

This grateful woman never troubled herself with any questions about
whether it was a miracle or not. She only knew that she had prayed
for ice in summer, and that the ice had come. And her faith was
stronger than ever that the gracious Saviour, who did so many
miracles when he was on earth, has just the same power now to comfort
his people when they are in trouble.

_In the third place, we see Jesus performing miracles to teach us
what power he has to_--ENCOURAGE--_his people_.

We have an account in St. Luke xiii: 10-17, of the miracle he
performed on the woman who had "a spirit of infirmity." This means
that she was a cripple. Her body was bound down, so that she had no
power to straighten herself or to stand upright. She had been in this
condition we are told for _eighteen_ years. How hard to bear--and how
discouraging this trial must have been to her! No doctor could give
her any relief, and she had made up her mind, no doubt, that there
was no relief for her till death came. But when Jesus saw her, he
pitied her. A miracle of healing was performed upon her. He laid his
loving hand upon her bent and crippled body, and in a moment her
disease was removed. She stood straight up, and glorified God. What
encouragement that must have given to her!

One day, when Jesus was at Capernaum, the tax-gatherers came to Peter
to get the tribute, or tax-money, that was due to the Roman
government, for himself and his master. But, it happened so that
neither of them had money enough with which to pay that tax. Peter
went into the presence of Jesus to speak to him about this matter.
But Jesus knowing what was in his mind, before Peter had time to say
anything on the subject, told him what to do. He directed him to take
his fishing-line and go to the lake, and cast in his line, and catch
the first fish that should bite; and said that in its mouth he would
find a piece of money with which he might pay the tribute that was
due for them both.

Peter went. He threw in his line. He soon caught a fish. He looked
into the fish's mouth and lo! there was a piece of money called a
stater. It was worth about sixty cents of our money, and was just
enough to pay the tribute for two persons. How wonderful this was! If
Jesus made this piece of money in the mouth of the fish, at the time
when Peter caught it, how wonderful his _power_ must be! And if,
without making it then, he knew that _that_ one fish, the only one in
the sea, probably, that had such a piece of money in its mouth, would
be the first to bite at Peter's line, then how wonderful his
_knowledge_ must be!

Peter would not be likely to forget that day's fishing as long as he
lived. And when he thought of the illustration it afforded of the
wonderful power and the wonderful knowledge of the master whom he was
serving, what encouragement that would give him in his work!

And Jesus is constantly doing things to encourage those who are
trying to serve him.

Let us look at some of the ways in which this is done. Our first
illustration is from the life of Washington Allston, the great
American painter. We may call it:

"Praying for Bread." Many years ago Mr. Allston was considered one of
the greatest artists in this country. At the time to which our story
refers, he was living in London. Then he was so poor that he and his
wife had not a morsel of bread to eat; nor a penny left with which to
buy any. In great discouragement he went into his studio, locked the
door, and throwing himself on his knees, he told the Lord his
trouble, and prayed earnestly for relief.

While he was still upon his knees, a knock was heard at the door. He
arose and opened the door. A stranger stood there.

"I wish to see Mr. Allston," said he.

"I am Mr. Allston," replied Mr. A.

"Pray tell me, sir, who has purchased your fine painting of the
'Angel Uriel,' which won the prize at the exhibition of the Royal
Academy?"

"That painting has not been sold," said Mr. A.

"Where is it to be found?"

"In this very room," said the artist, bringing a painting from the
corner, and wiping off the dust.

"What is the price of it?" asked the gentleman.

"I have done fixing a price on it," said Mr. A., "for I have always
asked more than people were willing to give."

"Will four hundred pounds be enough for it?" was the next question.

"That is more than I ever asked."

"Then the painting is mine," said the stranger, who introduced
himself as the Marquis of Stafford; and from that day he became one
of Mr. Allston's warmest friends.

What a lesson of encouragement the great painter learned that day,
when he asked for bread, and while he was asking, received help that
followed him all his days!

"The Hushed Tempest." A minister of the gospel in Canada gives this
account of a lesson of encouragement to trust God in trouble, which
he once received.

"It was in the year 1853, about the middle of the winter that we had
a succession of snowstorms, followed by high winds, and severe cold.
I was getting ready to haul my supply of wood for the rest of the
winter. I had engaged a man to go out the day before and cut the wood
and have it ready to haul. I borrowed a sled and two horses from a
neighbor and started early in the morning to haul the wood. Just as I
reached the place, it began to snow hard. The wind blew such a gale
that it was impossible to go on with the work. What was I to do? If
it kept on snowing, I knew the roads would be impassable by the next
day. Besides, that was the only day on which I could get the help of
the man or the team. Unless I secured the wood that day it would not
be in my power to get the fuel we needed for the rest of the winter.
I thought of that sweet promise, 'Call on me, in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee,' Ps. i: 15.

"I kneeled down amid the drifting snow, and said, 'O, my God, this is
a day of trouble to me. Lord help me. The elements are subject to thy
will: Thou holdest the winds in thy hands. If thou wilt speak the
word, there will be a great calm. O Lord, for the sake of my helpless
little ones, let this snow lie still, and give me the opportunity of
doing what I came to do, and what it is so necessary to do to-day,
for Jesus' sake. Amen!'

"I do not think it was more than fifteen minutes from the time I
began to pray, before there was a visible change. The wind became
more moderate; the sky was calm; in less than half an hour all was
still; and a more pleasant time for wood-hauling than we had that day
I never saw, nor desire to see. While I live, I never shall forget
the lesson of encouragement to trust in God that was taught me on
that day." And this was one of the lessons Jesus taught us by his
miracles.

_In the fourth place, among the miracles of Jesus we see some that
were intended to teach us his power to_--PROTECT--_his people_.

And there is no lesson that we more need to be taught than this;
because we are exposed to many dangers, from which we are too weak
to protect ourselves.

One day, Jesus went into the house of the apostle Peter, and found
the family in great distress, because the mother of Peter's wife was
very ill and in danger of dying. We judge from the history that she
was the head of the family. Her death would have been a great loss to
them all, and yet it seemed as if no human power could protect them
from that loss. But Jesus performed a miracle to save them from this
threatened danger. He went into the room where she lay. He put his
healing hands upon her, and at once she was well. Immediately she
rose up from that sick bed, and took her place in the family and
waited on Jesus.

On another occasion he was crossing the sea of Galilee with his
disciples. Weary with the work of love in which he had been engaged,
he laid down in the hinder part of the ship and fell asleep. While he
was lying there a sudden storm burst upon the sea. The wind howled in
its fury. The angry waves rose in their might and dashed against the
vessel in hissing foam. The ship was full of water, and in danger of
sinking. The terrified disciples came to their sleeping Master with
the earnest cry:--"Lord save us: we perish." He heard their cry. He
rose at once. Quietly he took his stand by the side of the
storm-tossed vessel. He rebuked the winds, and said unto the sea:--"
Peace: be still." They recognized their Master's voice and obeyed.
"The wind ceased, and immediately there was a great calm."

As long as those disciples lived they never would forget the lesson
he taught them by that miracle of his power to protect in danger.

And then many of the miracles of our Saviour were performed for the
purpose of showing what power he had to protect his people from
Satan, and the evil spirits that serve him. It pleased God to allow
these evil spirits to have more power over men during the time when
Jesus was on earth than they had before, or than they have now. We
often read in the gospels of men who were "possessed of devils." This
means that the evil spirits entered into the bodies of these men, and
used them as their own; just as you, or I, might go into an empty
house, and use it as if it belonged to us. But Jesus performed a
number of miracles to show that he was able to control those spirits;
to cast them out of the bodies of men and to protect his people from
their power. We have an account of one of these miracles in St. Matt,
viii: 28, 34; of another in St. Mark v: 1-20; and of another in St.
Luke viii: 26-39.

The Bible speaks of Satan "going about, like a roaring lion, seeking
whom he may devour." I. Peter v: 8. But he is a chained lion: and
Jesus holds the chain. If we are trying to love and serve Jesus, we
need not be afraid of this roaring lion. He cannot touch us till our
Saviour gives him permission; and he will not let him hurt us. We see
this illustrated in Job's case. Satan wanted very much to injure Job
in some way. But he could not do it. And the reason of it was, as he
said himself, that God had "put an hedge about him, and about his
house, and about all that he had on every side." Job i: 10. This
hedge, or fence, means the power which Jesus exercises to protect his
people from the harm that Satan desires to do to them. In this way he
protected Job. And in this way he protects all who love and serve
him.

Let us take an illustration or two to show how he is doing this
continually.

"Providential Deliverance." One of the best men, and one of the most
useful ministers in London, during the last century, was the Rev.
John Newton. Before entering the ministry he held an office under
the government. One of the duties of this office was for him to visit
and inspect the vessels of the navy as they lay at anchor in the
river Thames. One day he was going out to visit a man-of-war that lay
there. He was a very punctual man. When he had an engagement he was
always ready at the very moment. But when he reached the dock on this
occasion the boat which was to take him off to the man-of-war was not
there. He was obliged to wait five, ten, fifteen minutes before the
boat came. This displeased him very much. But the hand of God was in
this delay. For, just as the boat was leaving the dock, a spark fell
into the powder magazine on board the man-of-war. An explosion took
place. The huge vessel was blown to pieces, and all the men on board
of her were killed. That delay of a quarter of an hour saved Mr.
Newton's life. In this way that gracious Saviour whom he served
protected him from the danger to which he was exposed.

"Willie's Heroism." One summer afternoon a teacher told her geography
class that they might close their books and rest a little, while she
told them a story. The story was about William Tell, the famous hero
of Switzerland. She told the scholars how a wicked governor placed an
apple on the head of Tell's little boy and then compelled the father
to take his bow and arrow and shoot the apple from the head of his
son. He was very unwilling to do it, for he was afraid the arrow
might miss and kill his child. But the brave boy stood firm, and
cried out--"Shoot, father! I am not afraid." He took a steady aim;
fired, and knocked the apple off without hurting his son.

Just as the teacher was telling this story a sudden storm burst from
the sky. There was a flash of lightning, and a loud crash of thunder.
Some of the children screamed, and began to cry and ran to the
teacher for protection. But a little boy named Willie Hawthorne, kept
his seat and went on quietly studying his lesson.

When the storm was over the teacher said:

"Willie why were you not afraid like the other children?"

"Because," said he, "I knew the lightning was only an arrow in my
Heavenly Father's hand, and why should I be afraid?"

How well Willie had learned the lesson which Jesus taught his
disciples when he performed so many miracles to show what power he
has to protect his people from danger!

Here is just one other story to illustrate this truth. We may call
it:

"The Widow's Tree," Some years ago a violent storm, with wind and
thunder, swept through the valley of Yellow Creek, in Indiana County,
Georgia. For more than a mile in width trees were uprooted, houses,
barns, and fences were thrown down, and ruin and desolation was
spread all over the land.

In the centre of the region over which this hurricane swept stood a
small cabin. It was occupied by an aged Christian widow, with her
only son. The terrible wind struck a large tree in front of her
humble dwelling, twisting and dashing it about. If the tree should
fall it would crush her home, and probably kill herself and son. The
storm howled and raged, and the big trees were falling on every hand.
In the midst of all the danger the widow knelt in prayer, and asked
God to spare that tree, and protect her home, and save her own life,
and that of her son. Her prayer was heard. And when the storm was
over, the widow's tree was spared, and strange as it may seem, was
the only one left amidst that scene of desolation. There it stood,
as if on purpose to show what power our loving Saviour has to protect
from danger those who trust in him!

_But, in the last place, we see that Jesus performed some of his
miracles for the purpose of teaching us that he has power
to_--PARDON.

A man was brought him, one day, who was sick of the palsy. His limbs
were helpless. He was not able to come to Jesus himself, so his
friends carried him on a bed. At this time Jesus was preaching in the
yard, or court, connected with some rich man's house. In those
eastern countries the houses were not built as ours are, with a yard
back of them. There is a square yard in the centre, and the house is
built round the four sides of this square. This open space is
generally used as a garden. It has a fountain playing in it, and a
covering of cloth or mats spread over it to keep off the sun. It was
in one of these open courts that Jesus was preaching on this
occasion. A great crowd had gathered round him, so that the friends
of the palsied man could not get near him with the bed on which the
sufferer lay. Then they concluded to carry him up to the top of the
house, and lower him down inside. This would not be easy to do with
us. But the eastern houses are not so high as ours. And then they
have flat roofs, and a flight of steps leading from the ground, on
the outside, to the top of the house. This made it very easy to get
up. When they were on the roof they removed the covering from the
inner court, and let down the bed, with the sick man on it, directly
in front of our Saviour. When he saw him he pitied him, and said,
"Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee." The people were
surprised at this. The Pharisees said among themselves "This man
blasphemeth." Jesus knew their thoughts and told them it was as easy
for him to heal the souls of men, as it was to heal their bodies. And
then, to show them that he had power on earth to forgive sins, he
said to the sick man--"Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine
house. And he arose, and went to his house," Matt, ix: 1-8. Certainly
the object Jesus had in view, in performing this miracle, was to
prove that he had power to forgive sins; or to pardon.

And when he healed the leper it was to teach us the same great truth.
This disease was not only like all other diseases, the result of sin;
but, unlike most other diseases, it was a type, or figure of sin. It
affected the body as sin affects the soul. And then, leprosy was a
disease which none but God could cure; just as sin is an offence
which none but God our Saviour can pardon. And so Jesus performed the
miracle of healing the palsied man and the lepers in order to teach
his disciples the great lesson that he "had power on earth to forgive
sins."

And he has the same power still. Here are some illustrations of the
way in which he exercises this power now.

"No Pardon but From Jesus," There was a heathen man in India once,
who felt that he was a sinner, and longed to obtain pardon. The
priests had sent him to their most famous temples, all over the
country, but he could get no pardon, and find no peace. He had fasted
till he was about worn to a skeleton, and had done many painful
things--but pardon and peace he could not find. At last he was told
to put pebbles in his shoes and travel to a distant temple, and make
an offering there; and he would find peace. He went. He made the
offering; but still he found no relief from the burden of his sins.

Sad, and sorrowful, he was returning home with the pebbles still in
his shoes. Wearied with his journey, he halted one day in the shade
of a grove, by the wayside, where a company of people was gathered
round a stranger who was addressing them. It was a Christian
missionary preaching the gospel. The heathen listened with great
interest. The missionary was preaching from the words:--"The blood of
Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin." He showed what power Jesus had
to forgive sins and how able and willing he is to save all who come
unto him. The heart of the poor heathen was drawn to this loving and
glorious Saviour. He took off his shoes and threw away the pebbles,
saying "This is the Saviour I have long sought in vain. Thank God! I
have found salvation!"

Here is one more illustration of the way in which Jesus pardons our
sins, and of the effect which that pardon has on those who receive
it. We may call it:

"Pardon and Peace." An officer who held a high position under the
government of his country, and was a favorite with the king, was once
brought before the judge and charged with a great crime. He took his
place at the bar with the greatest coolness, and looked at the judge
and jury and the great crowd of spectators as calmly as if he were
at home, surrounded by his own family.

The trial began. The witnesses were called up, and gave clear
evidence that he was guilty. Still he remained as calm and unmoved as
ever. There was not the least sign of fear visible on his
countenance; on the contrary, his face wore a pleasant smile.

At last the jury came in, and while the crowd in the court-room held
their breath, declared that the prisoner was guilty. In an instant
every eye was turned upon the prisoner to see what effect this
sentence would have upon him. But just then, he put his hand in his
bosom, drew out a paper, and laid it on the table. It was a pardon, a
full, free pardon of all his offences, given him by the king, and
sealed with the royal signet. This was the secret of his peace. This
was what gave him such calmness and confidence in his dreadful
position as a condemned prisoner.

And so Jesus gives his people pardon in such promises as these:
"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow: though
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool," Is. i: 16. "Let
them return unto the Lord, for he will _abundantly pardon_." Is. lv:
7. "All that believe are justified from _all_ things." Acts xiii:
39. These promises are like the king's pardon which the officer had
received. Faith in these promises brings pardon, and the pardon
brings peace. And so, by what he is doing now, as well as by the
miracles he performed when on earth, we are taught the precious
truth, that--"The Son of man hath power to forgive sins."

Then when we think of the wonderful miracles that Jesus did, let us
always remember the illustrations they afford of the power he had to
_help_--_to comfort_--_to encourage_--_to protect_--_and to pardon_.

Let us seek to secure all these blessings to ourselves, and then we
shall find that what Jesus taught by his miracles will be very
profitable teaching to us!


CHRIST TEACHING LIBERALITY


If we should attempt to mention all the parables which Jesus spoke,
and the miracles which he performed, and the many other lessons which
he taught, it would make a long list. As we have done before we can
only take one or two specimens of these general lessons which Jesus
taught.

We have one of these in the title to our present chapter, which
is--_Christ Teaching Liberality_. This was a very important lesson
for Jesus to teach. One of the sad effects of sin upon our nature is
to make it selfish, and covetous. We are tempted to love money more
than we ought to do. We are not so willing to part with it as we
should be. And we never can be good and true Christians unless we
overcome the selfishness of our sinful hearts, and not only learn to
give, but to give liberally. The Bible teaches us that God not only
expects his people to give, but, as St. Paul says, in one place, to
give "_cheerfully_." II. Cor. ix: 7.

And this is the lesson Jesus taught when he said to his
disciples,--"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure,
pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
into your bosoms." St. Luke vi: 38.

And when we come to consider these words of Jesus, there are three
things to engage our attention. _The first of these is the_--LESSON
OF LIBERALITY--_here set before us_.

_The second is_--THE PROOF--_that this lesson is taught all through
the Bible_.

_And the third is_--THE ILLUSTRATIONS--_of this lesson_.

And then, when put into its shortest form, our present subject may be
thus expressed--_the lesson of liberality; its proofs; and its
illustrations_.

And the lesson which Jesus here taught is all wrapped up in this
little word--"_Give_." Here we learn what the will of Jesus is on
this subject. This is not simply the expression of his opinion. It is
not merely his advice; no, but it is his _command_. He is speaking
here as our Master--our King--our God. He _commands_ us to--give.
And when we remember how he said to his disciples, "If ye love me,
_keep my commandments_," we see plainly, that we have no right to
consider ourselves as his disciples if we are neglecting this or any
other of his plain commands.

And this command about giving is not intended for any _one_ class of
persons among the followers of Christ, but for _all_ of them. It is
not a command designed for kings, or princes, or rich men only, but
for the poor as well. It is not a command for grown persons alone,
but for children also. As soon as we begin to _get_, God expects us
to begin to _give_.

Jesus says nothing here about _how much_ he expects us to give. But,
from other places in the Bible, we learn that he expects us to give
_at least one-tenth_ of all that we have. If we have a thousand
dollars he expects us to give one hundred out of the thousand. If we
have a hundred he expects us to give ten. If we have ten dollars we
must give one of them to God. If we have only one dollar we must give
ten cents of it to Him. If we have but ten cents we must give one of
them. If we have no money to give, God expects us to give kind words,
and kind actions, our sympathy and love.

Jesus does not tell us here _how often_ we are to give, but
simply--give. This means that we are to learn the lesson and form the
habit of giving. His command is--give. And in giving us this command
he is only asking us to imitate his own example. _He is giving all
the time_. The apostle Paul tells us that Jesus is "exalted to the
right hand of the Father to--give." He never tires of giving. "He
giveth to all life, breath, and all things." And if we have not the
Spirit of Christ in this respect, "we are none of his."

This, then, is the lesson of liberality that Jesus taught when he
said--"give." And that _giving is God's rule for getting_ is what we
are taught by our Saviour, when he said--"_Give, and it shall be
given unto you_."

And now, having seen what this lesson of liberality is, which Jesus
taught, _let us look at some of the Scripture proofs of it_. The same
lesson is taught in other places in the Bible. Let us see what is
said about it in some of these places.

In Ps. xli: 1 David says--"Blessed is he that considereth the poor:
the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble." Considering the poor
here, means being kind to them, and giving them such things as they
need. And the blessing promised to those who do this means that God
will reward them by giving to them good things in great abundance.
And, if this is so, then we have proof here that "giving is God's
rule for getting."

We have another proof that "giving is God's rule for getting," in
Prov. iii: 9, 10. Here Solomon says--"Honor the Lord with thy
substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase: So shall
thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with
new wine."

When the Jewish farmers gathered in their harvests they were required
to make an offering to God, of what had been gathered, before they
used any part of it for themselves; and the offerings thus made were
called "the first-fruits." God considered himself honored by his
people when they did this, because they were keeping his commandments
and doing what he wished them to do. And the meaning of this command,
when we apply it to ourselves, is that we should give something to
the cause of God from all the money, or property we have, and from
all the gain, or increase that we make to the same. This is the Bible
rule--the will or command of God for all his people. And then, in
the other part of this passage we have the promise of God to all who
do this. "So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
shall burst out with new wine."

This means that they shall be rich and prosperous. And so we see that
this passage from the book of Proverbs, teaches the same lesson of
liberality that our Saviour taught when he said--"_Give and it shall
be given unto you_." It proves that "giving is God's rule for
getting."

And Solomon teaches the same, again, when he says, "The liberal soul
shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall be watered also
himself." Prov. xi: 25.

A "liberal soul" means a person who is in the habit of giving; and to
be "made fat" means to be prospered and happy. If you undertake to
water a garden, you are _giving_ to the thirsty plants that which
they need to make them grow and thrive; and when it is promised that
the person who does this shall "be watered also himself," the meaning
is that he shall have given to him all that is most important to
supply his wants, and make him happy. And this, we see, is only
teaching what our Saviour taught when he said, "Give, and it shall be
given unto you." It furnishes us with another proof that "giving is
God's rule for getting."

In the nineteenth chapter of Proverbs and seventeenth verse we have a
very clear proof of the lesson we are now considering. Here we find
it said: "_He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord;
and that which he hath given will he pay him again_." Having pity on
the poor, as here spoken of, means giving them such things as they
need. Whatever we use in this way God looks upon as so much money
lent unto him; and we have his solemn promise that when we lend
anything to him, in this way, "He will pay us again." And when he
pays again what has been lent to him, it is always with interest. He
pays back four, or five, or ten times as much as was lent: to him.
This proves that "giving is God's rule for getting."

One other passage is all that need be referred to in order to prove
that the lesson of liberality which our Saviour taught is the same
lesson which the Bible teaches everywhere. In Eccles. xi: 1, God
says, "_Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after
many days_."

If we should see a man standing on the end of a wharf and throwing
bread upon the waters, we should think that he was a foolish man,
who was wasting his bread, or only feeding the fishes with it. But
suppose that you and I were travelling through Egypt--the land of the
celebrated pyramids and other great wonders. The famous river Nile is
there. During our visit the inundation of that river takes place. It
overflows its banks, and spreads its water over all the level plains
that border on the river. This takes place every year. And when the
fields are all overflowed with water, the farmers go out in boats,
and scatter their grain over the surface of the water. The grain
sinks to the bottom. The sediment in the water settles down on the
grain, and covers it with mud. By and by the waters flow back into
the river. The fields become dry. The grain springs up and grows. The
mud that covered it is like rich manure, and makes it grow very
plentifully, and yield a rich harvest. And here we see the meaning of
this passage. God makes use of this Egyptian custom to teach us the
lesson of liberality that we are now considering. He tells us that
the money which we give to the poor, or use to do good with, is like
the grain which the Egyptian farmer casts upon the water, and which
will surely yield a rich harvest by and by.

This teaches us the lesson of liberality. And when we think of all
these passages, we see very clearly that the Bible teaches the same
lesson which Jesus taught when he said to his disciples, "Give, and
it shall be given unto you." And what we learn, both from the
teaching of Christ, and from the different passages referred to,
is--that "giving is God's rule for getting."

And now, having seen some of the Bible, proofs for this lesson of
liberality, or for this rule about giving and getting, _let us go on
to speak of some of the illustrations of this rule_. These are very
numerous.

And we may draw our illustrations from three sources, viz.:--_from
the Bible; from nature; and from everyday life_.

There are two illustrations of which we may speak from the Bible. We
find one of these in the history of the prophet Elijah. You remember
that there was a great famine in the land of Israel during the
lifetime of this prophet. For more than three years there was not a
drop of rain all through the land. The fields, the vineyards, and
gardens dried up, and withered, and yielded no fruit. During the
first part of the time when this famine was prevailing, God sent
Elijah to "the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan," I. Kings xvii:
7-17. There the ravens brought him food, and he drank of the water of
the brook.

But after awhile the brook dried up. Then God told him to go to the
city of Zarephath, or Sarepta, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea,
and that he had commanded a widow woman there to sustain him. He did
not tell him the name of the woman; nor the street she lived in; nor
the number of her house. Elijah went. When he came near the place he
met a woman, picking up some sticks of wood. I suppose God told him
that this was the woman he was to stay with. Elijah spoke to her, and
asked her if she would please give him a drink of water. When she was
going to get it, he called to her again, and said he was hungry, and
asked her to bring him a piece of bread. Then she told him that there
was not a morsel of bread in her house. All she had in the world was
a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse, and that
she was gathering a few sticks, that she might go and bake the last
cake for herself and her son, that they might eat it and die. And
Elijah said, "Fear not; go, and do as thou hast said; but make me
thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make
for thee, and for thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil
fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth."

This was a hard thing to ask a mother to do. It was asking her to
take the last morsel of bread she had, and that she needed for
herself and for her hungry boy, and give it to a stranger. Yet she
did it; because she believed God. I seem to see her turning the meal
barrel up, to get the meal all out. Then she pours out the oil from
the cruse, and drains out the last drop. She mixes the meal and the
olive oil together, as is the custom in that country still, and makes
a cake which can soon be baked. She takes it to the man of God, who
eats it thankfully, and is refreshed. Then she returns to the empty
barrel and cruse, and finds as much in them as she had lately taken
out. She prepares some bread for herself and her son, and they eat it
thankfully as bread sent from heaven. The next day it is the same,
and the day after, and so on through all the days of the famine. We
are not told how long it was after Elijah went to the widow's house
before the days of the famine were over. But suppose we make a
calculation about it. The famine lasted for three years. Now let us
suppose, that the first half of this time was spent by the prophet at
the brook Cherith. Then his stay at the widow's house must have been
at least eighteen months. And, if this miracle of increasing the meal
and the oil was repeated only once a day, there would be for the
first twelve months, or for the year, three hundred and sixty-five
miracles; and for the six months, or the half year, one hundred and
eighty-two more; and adding these together we have the surprising
number of _five hundred and forty-seven_ miracles, that were
performed to reward this good widow for the kindness she showed to
the prophet Elijah, when she gave him a piece of bread, and a drink
of water! What an illustration we have here of the truth we are
considering, that _giving is God's rule for getting_.

But the best illustration of this subject to be found in the Bible is
given in our Saviour's own experience. He not only _preached_ the
lesson of liberality, but _practised_ it. He is himself the greatest
giver ever heard of. In becoming our Redeemer he showed himself the
Prince of givers. He gave--not silver and gold; not all the wealth of
the world, or of ten thousand worlds like ours; but "He gave
_Himself_ for us." He can say indeed, to each of us, in the language
of the hymn:

  "I gave my life for thee,
    My precious blood I shed,
  That thou might'st ransomed be,
    And quickened from the dead."

And what is the result of this glorious giving to Jesus himself? St.
Paul answers this question when he says, "Wherefore God also hath
highly exalted him; and given him a name which is above every name;
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven,
and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father," Phil, ii: 9-11. Because of what he gave "for us men, and
for our salvation," he will be loved and praised and honored in
heaven, on the earth, and through all the universe, above all other
beings, for ever and ever. What a glorious illustration we have here
of the truth of this statement, that "giving is God's rule for
getting." These are some of the illustrations of this lesson of
liberality that we find in the Bible.

_And now, let us look at some illustrations of this subject, that we
have in nature_.

Solomon suggests one of these when he says, "_There is that
scattereth, and yet increaseth_." Prov. xi: 26. He is evidently
speaking here of a farmer sowing his fields with grain.

Now suppose that we had never seen a man sowing; and that we knew
nothing at all about the growth of grain, or how wonderfully the seed
sown in the spring is increased and multiplied when the harvest is
reaped. Then, the first time we saw a farmer sowing his fields, we
should have been ready to say, "What a foolish man that is! He is
taking that precious grain by the handful, and deliberately throwing
it away."

Of course, we should have expected that the grain thus thrown away,
or scattered over the ground, would all be lost. But, if we could
have come back to visit that farmer when he was gathering in his
harvest, how surprised we should have been! I saw nothing except
a gray felt hat, cocked over one ear above a pair of broad
shoulders, driving off in a cloud of dust.

THE PATRON
We never dreamed of such good fortune! The son of a provincial bailiff,
Jean Marin had come, as do so many others, to study law in the
Quartier Latin. In the various beer-houses that he had frequented
he had made friends with several talkative students who spouted
politics as they drank their beer.

He had a great admiration for them and followed them persistently
from cafe to cafe, even paying for their drinks when he had the
money.

He became a lawyer and pleaded causes, which he lost. However, one
morning he read in the papers that one of his former comrades of the
Quartier had just been appointed deputy.

He again became his faithful hound, the friend who does the drudgery,
the unpleasant tasks, for whom one sends when one has need of him
and with whom one does not stand on ceremony. But it chanced through
some parliamentary incident that the deputy became a minister.
Six months later Jean Marin was appointed a state councillor.

He was so elated with pride at first that he lost his head. He
would walk through the streets just to show himself off, as
though one could tell by his appearance what position he occupied. He
managed to say to the shopkeepers as soon as he entered a store,
bringing it in somehow in the course of the most insignificant
remarks and even to the news vendors and the cabmen:

"I, who am a state councillor--"
Then, in consequence of his position as well as for professional
reasons and as in duty bound through being an influential and
generous man, he felt an imperious need of patronizing others. He
offered his support to every one on all occasions and with unbounded
generosity.

When he met any one he recognized on the boulevards he would advance
to meet them with a charmed air, would take their hand, inquire
after their health, and, without waiting for any questions, remark:

"You know I am state councillor, and I am entirely at your service.
If I can be of any use to you, do not hesitate to call on me. In my
position one has great influence."
Then he would go into some cafe with the friend he had just met and
ask for a pen and ink and a sheet of paper. "Just one, waiter; it is
to write a letter of recommendation."
And he wrote ten, twenty, fifty letters of recommendation a day. He
wrote them to the Cafe Americain, to Bignon's, to Tortoni's, to the
Maison Doree, to the Cafe Riche, to the Helder, to the Cafe Anglais,
to the Napolitain, everywhere, everywhere. He wrote them to all the
officials of the republican government, from the magistrates to the
ministers. And he was happy, perfectly happy.

One morning as he was starting out to go to the council it began to
rain.
He hesitated about taking a cab, but decided not to do so and set
out on foot.

The rain came down in torrents, swamping the sidewalks and inundating
the streets. M. Marin was obliged to take shelter in a doorway.
An old priest was standing there--an old priest with white hair.
Before he became a councillor M. Marin did not like the clergy. Now
he treated them with consideration, ever since a cardinal had consulted
him on an important matter. The rain continued to pour down in floods
and obliged the two men to take shelter in the porter's lodge so as
to avoid getting wet. M.
Marin, who was always itching to talk so as to let people know who he
was, remarked:

"This is horrible weather, Monsieur l'Abbe."
The old priest bowed:

"Yes indeed, sir, it is very unpleasant when one comes to Paris for
only a few days."
"Ah! You come from the provinces?"
"Yes, monsieur. I am only passing through on my journey."
"It certainly is very disagreeable to have rain during the few days one
spends in the capital. We officials who stay here the year round,
we think nothing of it."

The priest did not reply. He was looking at the street where the rain
seemed to be falling less heavily.

And with a sudden resolve he raised his cassock just as women raise
their skirts in stepping across water.

M. Marin, seeing him start away, exclaimed:

"You will get drenched, Monsieur l'Abbe. Wait a few moments longer; the
rain will be over."
The good man stopped irresistibly and then said:

"But I am in a great hurry. I have an important engagement."
M. Marin seemed quite worried.

"But you will be absolutely drenched.

Might I ask in which direction you are going?"
The priest appeared to hesitate. Then he said:

"I am going in the direction of the Palais Royal."
"In that case, if you will allow me, Monsieur l'Abbe, I will offer
you the shelter of my umbrella: As for me, I am going to the council.
I am a councillor of state."
The old priest raised his head and looked at his neighbor and then
exclaimed:

"I thank you, monsieur. I shall be glad to accept your offer."
M. Marin then took his arm and led him away. He directed him, watched
over him and advised him.

"Be careful of that stream, Monsieur l'Abbe. And be very careful
about the carriage wheels; they spatter you with mud sometimes
from head to foot.

Look out for the umbrellas of the people passing by; there is nothing
more dangerous to the eyes than the tips of the ribs.

  Women especially are unbearable;
    they pay no heed to where they are
  going and always jab you in the
    face with the point of their
  parasols or umbrellas.
    And they never move aside for
  anybody. One would suppose the town
    belonged to them.

They monopolize the pavement and the street. It is my opinion that
their education has been greatly neglected."
And M. Marin laughed.

The priest did not reply. He walked along, slightly bent over, picking
his steps carefully so as not to get mud on his boots or his cassock.

M. Marin resumed:

"I suppose you have come to Paris to divert your mind a little?"

The good man replied:

"No, I have some business to attend to."
"Ali! Is it important business?

Might I venture to ask what it is? If I can be of any service
to you, you may command me."
The priest seemed embarrassed. He murmured:

"Oh, it is a little personal matter; a little difficulty
with--with my bishop. It would not interest you. It is a matter of
internal regulation--an ecclesiastical affair."
M. Marin was eager.

"But it is precisely the state council that regulates all those
things.
In that case, make use of me."
"Yes, monsieur, it is to the council that I am going. You are a
thousand times too kind. I have to see M. Lerepere and M. Savon and
also perhaps M. Petitpas."

M. Marin stopped short.

"Why, those are my friends, Monsieur l'Abbe, my best friends, excellent
colleagues, charming men. I will speak to them about you, and very
highly. Count upon me."
The cure thanked him, apologizing for troubling him, and stammered
out a thousand grateful promises.

M. Marin was enchanted.

"Ah, you may be proud of having made a stroke of luck, Monsieur
l'Abbe.
You will see--you will see that, thanks to me, your affair will
go along swimmingly."
They reached the council hall. M. Marin took the priest into his
office, offered him a chair in front of the fire and sat down
himself at his desk and began to write.

"My dear colleague, allow me to recommend to you most highly a
venerable and particularly worthy and deserving priest, M. L'Abbe----"

He stopped and asked:

"Your name, if you please?"
"L'Abbe Ceinture."
"M. l'Abbe Ceinture, who needs your good office in a little matter which
he will communicate to you.

"I am pleased at this incident which gives me an opportunity, my dear
colleague----"

And he finished with the usual compliments.

When he had written the three letters he handed them to his protege,
who took his departure with many protestations of gratitude.

M. Marin attended to some business and then went home, passed the
day quietly, slept well, woke in a good humor and sent for his
newspapers.

The first he opened was a radical sheet. He read:

"OUR CLERGY AND OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
"We shall never make an end of enumerating the misdeeds of the clergy.
A certain priest, named Ceinture, convicted of conspiracy against the
present government, accused of base actions to which we will not even
allude, suspected besides of being a former Jesuit, metamorphosed
into a simple priest, suspended by a bishop for causes that are
said to be unmentionable and summoned to Paris to give an
explanation of his conduct, has found an ardent defender in the
man named Marin, a councillor of state, who was not afraid to give
this frocked malefactor the warmest letters of recommendation to
all the republican officials, his colleagues.

"We call the attention of the ministry to the unheard of attitude
of this councillor of state----"
M. Marin bounded out of bed, dressed himself and hastened to his
colleague, Petitpas, who said to him:

"How now? You were crazy to recommend to me that old conspirator!"

M. Marin, bewildered, stammered out:

"Why no--you see--I was deceived. He looked such an honest man.
He played me a trick--a disgraceful trick! I beg that you will
sentence him severely, very severely.

I am going to write. Tell me to whom I should write about having him
punished. I will go and see the attorney-general and the archbishop
of Paris--yes, the archbishop."
And seating himself abruptly at M. Petitpas' desk, he wrote:

"Monseigneur, I have the honor to bring to your grace's notice the
fact that I have recently been made a victim of the intrigues and
lies of a certain Abbe Ceinture, who imposed on my kind-heartedness.

"Deceived by the representations of this ecclesiastic, I was
led----"
Then, having signed and sealed his letter, he turned to his colleague
and exclaimed:

"See here; my dear friend, let this be a warning to you never to
recommend any one again."

THE DOOR
"Bah!" exclaimed Karl Massouligny, "the question of complaisant husbands
is a difficult one. I have seen many kinds, and yet I am unable to
give an opinion about any of them. I have often tried to determine
whether they are blind, weak or clairvoyant. I believe that there
are some which belong to each of these categories.

"Let us quickly pass over the blind ones. They cannot rightly be called
complaisant, since they do not know, but they are good creatures
who cannot see farther than their nose. It is a curious and interesting
thing to notice the ease with which men and women can, be
deceived. We are taken in by the slightest trick of those who surround
us, by our children, our friends, our servants, our tradespeople.
Humanity is credulous, and in order to discover deceit in others,
we do not display one-tenth the shrewdness which we use when we,
in turn, wish to deceive some one else.

"Clairvoyant husbands may be divided into three classes: Those who
have some interest, pecuniary, ambitious or otherwise, in their
wife's having love affairs.

These ask only to safeguard appearances as much as possible, and
they are satisfied.

"Next come those who get angry. What a beautiful novel one could write
about them!

"Finally the weak ones! Those who are afraid of scandal.

"There are also those who are powerless, or, rather, tired, who flee
from the duties of matrimony through fear of ataxia or apoplexy,
who are satisfied to see a friend run these risks.

"But I once met a husband of a rare species, who guarded against
the common accident in a strange and witty manner.

"In Paris I had made the acquaintance of an elegant, fashionable
couple.

The woman, nervous, tall, slender, courted, was supposed to have had
many love adventures.

She pleased me with her wit, and I believe that I pleased her also. I
courted her, a trial courting to which she answered with evident
provocations. Soon we got to tender glances, hand pressures, all the
little gallantries which precede the final attack.

"Nevertheless, I hesitated. I consider that, as a rule, the majority
of society intrigues, however short they may be, are not worth the
trouble which they give us and the difficulties which may arise. I
therefore mentally compared the advantages and disadvantages which
I might expect, and I thought I noticed that the husband suspected
me.

"One evening, at a ball, as I was saying tender things to the young
woman in a little parlor leading from the big hall where the dancing
was going on, I noticed in a mirror the reflection of some one who
was watching me.

It was he. Our looks met and then I saw him turn his head and walk
away.

"I murmured: 'Your husband is spying on us.'
"She seemed dumbfounded and asked: 'My husband?'
"'Yes, he has been watching us for some time:

"'Nonsense! Are you sure?'
"'Very sure.'
"'How strange! He is usually extraordinarily pleasant to all my
friends.'
"'Perhaps he guessed that I love you!'
"'Nonsense! You are not the first one to pay attention to me. Every
woman who is a little in view drags behind her a herd of admirers.'

"'Yes. But I love you deeply.'
"'Admitting that that is true, does a husband ever guess those things?'

"'Then he is not jealous?'
"'No-no!'
"She thought for an instant and then continued: 'No. I do not think
that I ever noticed any jealousy on his part.'
"'Has he never-watched you?'
"'No.

As I said, he is always agreeable to my friends.'
"From that day my courting became much more assiduous.

The woman did not please me any more than before, but the probable
jealousy of her husband tempted me greatly.

"As for her, I judged her coolly and clearly. She had a certain worldly
charm, due to a quick, gay, amiable and superficial mind, but no real,
deep attraction. She was, as I have already said, an excitable
little being, all on the surface, with rather a showy elegance.
How can I explain myself? She was an ornament, not a home.

"One day, after taking dinner with her, her husband said to me, just
as I was leaving: 'My dear friend' (he now called me 'friend'),
'we soon leave for the country. It is a great pleasure to my wife
and myself to entertain people whom we like. We would be very pleased
to have you spend a month with us. It would be very nice of you
to do so.'
"I was dumbfounded, but I accepted.

"A month later I arrived at their estate of Vertcresson, in Touraine.

They were waiting for me at the station, five miles from the chateau.

There were three of them, she, the husband and a gentleman unknown
to me, the Comte de Morterade, to whom I was introduced.

He appeared to be delighted to make my acquaintance, and the
strangest ideas passed through my mind while we trotted along the
beautiful road between two hedges. I was saying to myself: 'Let's
see, what can this mean? Here is a husband who cannot doubt that
his wife and I are on more than friendly terms, and yet he invites
me to his house, receives me like an old friend and seems to say:
"Go ahead, my friend, the road is clear!"'
"Then I am introduced to a very pleasant gentleman, who seems already
to have settled down in the house, and--and who is perhaps trying
to get out of it, and who seems as pleased at my arrival as the
husband himself.
"Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire? One might think
so.
But, then, would these two men tacitly have come to one of these
infamous little agreements so common in society? And it is proposed
to me that I should quietly enter into the pact and carry it out.
All hands and arms are held out to me. All doors and hearts are
open to me.
"And what about her? An enigma. She cannot be ignorant of
everything.
However--however--Well, I cannot understand it.
"The dinner was very gay and cordial. On leaving the table the
husband and his friend began to play cards, while I went out on the
porch to look at the moonlight with madame. She seemed to be greatly
affected by nature, and I judged that the moment for my happiness
was near. That evening she was really delightful. The country had
seemed to make her more tender. Her long, slender waist looked
pretty on this stone porch beside a great vase in which grew some
flowers. I felt like dragging her out under the trees, throwing
myself at her feet and speaking to her words of love.
"Her husband's voice called 'Louise!' 
"'Yes, dear.'
"'You are forgetting the tea.'
"'I'll go and see about it, my friend.'
"We returned to the house, and she gave us some tea. When the two
men had finished playing cards, they were visibly tired. I had to
go to my room.
I did not get to sleep till late, and then I slept badly.
"An excursion was decided upon for the following afternoon, and we
went in an open carriage to visit some ruins. She and I were in the
back of the vehicle and they were opposite us, riding backward. The
conversation was sympathetic and agreeable. I am an orphan, and it
seemed to me as though I had just found my family, I felt so at
home with them.
"Suddenly, as she had stretched out her foot between her husband's
legs, he murmured reproachfully: 'Louise, please don't wear out
your old shoes yourself. There is no reason for being neater in
Paris than in the country.'
"I lowered my eyes. She was indeed wearing worn-out shoes, and I
noticed that her stockings were not pulled up tight.
"She had blushed and hidden her foot under her dress. The friend
was looking out in the distance with an indifferent and unconcerned
look.
"The husband offered me a cigar, which I accepted. For a few days
it was impossible for me to be alone with her for two minutes; he
was with us everywhere. He was delightful to me, however.
"One morning he came to get me to take a walk before breakfast, and
the conversation happened to turn on marriage. I spoke a little
about solitude and about how charming life can be made by the
affection of a woman. Suddenly he interrupted me, saying: 'My friend,
don't talk about things you know nothing about. A woman who has no
other reason for loving you will not love you long. All the little
coquetries which make them so exquisite when they do not definitely
belong to us cease as soon as they become ours. And then--the
respectable women--that is to say our wives--are--are not--in fact
do not understand their profession of wife. Do you understand?'
"He said no more, and I could not guess his thoughts.
"Two days after this conversation he called me to his room quite
early, in order to show me a collection of engravings. I sat in an
easy chair opposite the big door which separated his apartment from
his wife's, and behind this door I heard some one walking and moving,
and I was thinking very little of the engravings, although I kept
exclaiming: 'Oh, charming!
delightful! exquisite!'
"He suddenly said: 'Oh, I have a beautiful specimen in the next
room.
I'll go and get it.'
"He ran to the door quickly, and both sides opened as though for a
theatrical effect.
"In a large room, all in disorder, in the midst of skirts, collars,
waists lying around on the floor, stood a tall, dried-up creature.
The lower part of her body was covered with an old, worn-out silk
petticoat, which was hanging limply on her shapeless form, and she
was standing in front of a mirror brushing some short, sparse blond
hairs. Her arms formed two acute angles, and as she turned around
in astonishment I saw under a common cotton chemise a regular
cemetery of ribs, which were hidden from the public gaze by
well-arranged pads.
"The husband uttered a natural exclamation and came back, closing
the doors, and said: 'Gracious! how stupid I am! Oh, how thoughtless!
My wife will never forgive me for that!'
"I already felt like thanking him. I left three days later, after
cordially shaking hands with the two men and kissing the lady's
fingers.
She bade me a cold good-by."
Karl Massouligny was silent. Some one asked: "But what was the
friend?"
"I don't know--however--however he looked greatly distressed to see
me leaving so soon." 

A SALE
The defendants, Cesaire-Isidore Brument and Prosper-Napoleon Cornu,
appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Seine-Inferieure, on a
charge of attempted murder, by drowning, of Mme. Brument, lawful
wife of the first of the aforenamed.
The two prisoners sat side by side on the traditional bench. They
were two peasants; the first was small and stout, with short arms,
short legs, and a round head with a red pimply face, planted directly
on his trunk, which was also round and short, and with apparently
no neck. He was a raiser of pigs and lived at Cacheville-la-Goupil,
in the district of Criquetot.
Cornu (Prosper-Napoleon) was thin, of medium height, with enormously
long arms. His head was on crooked, his jaw awry, and he squinted.I will quote here, in finishing, three verses which teach the same
lesson that our Saviour taught when he spoke the words from which I
have tried to draw the lesson of liberality. The title at the head of
them is taken from Solomon's words in one of the passages from the
book of Proverbs, which we have already used.

"THERE IS THAT SCATTERETH AND YET INCREASETH."

  "Is thy cruse of comfort wasting?
    Rise, and share it with another;
  And through all the years of famine,
    It shall serve thee and thy brother.
  God himself will fill thy storehouse,
    Or thy handful still renew:
  Scanty fare for _one_ will often
    Make a royal feast for _two_.

  "For the heart grows rich in giving;
    All its wealth is living grain:
  Seeds which mildew in the garner,
    Scattered, fill with gold the plain.
  Is thy burden hard and heavy?
    Do thy steps drag wearily?
  Help to bear thy brother's burden,--
    God will bear both it and thee.

  "Is thy heart a well left empty?
    None but God its void can fill;
  Nothing but a ceaseless fountain
    Can this ceaseless longing still.
  Is the heart a living power?
    Self-entwined its strength sinks low;
  It can only live in loving,
    And by serving love will grow."


CHRIST TEACHING HUMILITY


During the earthly life of our blessed Saviour, we see how
everything connected with it teaches the lesson of humility. This is
pointed out in the beautiful collect in The Book of Common Prayer for
the first Sunday in Advent. Here we are taught to say:--"Almighty
God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put upon
us the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life, in which
thy Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in--great _humility_."

If Jesus had come into our world as an angel, it would have been an
act of humility. If he had come as a great and mighty king, it would
have been an act of humility. But when he was born in a stable, and
cradled in a manger; when he could say of himself, "the foxes have
holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath
not where to lay his head;" when there never was an acre, or a foot
of ground that he called his own, although he made the world and all
things in it; when he sailed in a borrowed boat, and was buried in a
borrowed tomb; how well it might be said that he was teaching
humility all the days of his life on earth! Yet he did not think that
_this_ was enough. And so he gave his disciples a special lesson on
this subject.

We have an account of this lesson in St. John xiii: 4-15. It is
taught us in these words:--"He riseth from supper, and laid aside his
garments; and took a towel and girdled himself. After that he poureth
water into a bason, and began to wash his disciples' feet, and to
wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded." Then occurs the
incident about the objection which Peter made to letting Jesus wash
his feet, and the way in which that objection was overcome. And then
the story goes on thus:--"So after he had washed their feet, and had
taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, 'Know
ye what I have done unto you? Ye call me Master, and Lord; and ye say
well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your
feet; ye ought also to wash one another's feet. For I have given you
an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.'"

This was a very surprising scene. How astonished the angels must have
been when they looked upon it! They had known Jesus in heaven, before
he took upon him our nature, and came into this fallen world. They
had seen him in "the glory which he had with the Father, before the
world was." They had worshipped him in the midst of all that glory.
And then, when they saw him, girded with a towel and washing the feet
of poor sinful men whom he came from heaven to save, how surprising
it must have seemed to them! And when Jesus told his disciples that
his object in doing this was to set them an example, that they should
do as he had done to them, he did not mean that they should literally
make a practice of washing each other's feet; but that they should
show the same humility to others that he had shown to them, by being
willing to do anything, however humble it might be, in order to
promote their comfort and happiness. It is not the act itself, here
spoken of, that Jesus teaches us to do; but the spirit of humility in
which the act was performed that he teaches us to cultivate. We might
go through the form of washing the feet of other persons, and yet
feel proud and haughty all the time we were doing it. Then we should
not be following the example of Jesus at all. When Jesus washed his
disciples' feet, what he wished to teach them, and us, and all his
people, is how earnestly he desires us to learn this lesson of
humility. And when we think of the wondrous scene which took place on
that occasion, the one thought it should impress on our minds, above
all others is--_the importance of humility_.

And if any one asks what is meant by humility? No better answer can
be given to this question than we find in Romans xii: 3, where St.
Paul tells us "not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to
think, but to think soberly." Pride is "thinking of ourselves more
highly than we ought to think." Humility is--_not_ "thinking of
ourselves more highly than we ought to think." And humility is the
lesson we are now to study. This is the lesson that Jesus wishes all
who love him to learn. It is easy to speak of _five_ reasons why we
should learn this lesson.

_And the first reason for learning it is--the_ COMMAND--_of Jesus_.

When he had finished washing his disciples' feet, he told them that
"they should do as he had done to them." This was his command to his
disciples, and to us, to learn the lesson of humility. And this is
not the only place in which Jesus taught this lesson. He gave some of
his beautiful parables to teach humility. We find one of these in St.
Luke xiv: 7-12.

On one occasion when he saw the people all pressing forward to get
the best seats for themselves at a feast, he took the opportunity of
giving his disciples a lesson about humility. He told them, when they
were bidden to a wedding feast, not to take the highest seats;
because some more honorable person might be bidden, and when the
master of the feast came in he might say to them 'let this man have
that seat, and you go and take a lower seat'; then they would feel
mortified, and ashamed. And then he gave his disciples this command:
"When thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room," or seat;
"that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go
up higher: then shalt thou have worship"--or honor--"in the presence
of them that sit at meat with thee." Here we have Jesus repeating
his command to all his people to learn and practise the lesson of
humility.

And then we have another of our Saviour's parables in which he taught
this same lesson of humility, and that is the parable of the Pharisee
and the Publican. We find it in St. Luke xviii: 10-15. The parable
reads thus: "Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed
thus with himself, 'God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men
are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I
fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.'" Here
we have a picture of a proud man. He pretended to pray, but asked for
nothing, because he did not feel his need of anything. And so his
pretended prayer brought him no blessing.

And then in the rest of the parable we have our Saviour's description
of a man who was learning the lesson of humility, and of the blessing
which it brought to him.

Here is a story told by one of our missionaries of the way in which
this parable brought a heathen man to Christ.

"That's Me." A poor Hottentot in Southern Africa lived with a Dutch
farmer, who was a good Christian man, and kept up family prayer in
his home. One day, at their family worship he read this parable. He
began, "Two men went up into the temple to pray." The poor savage,
who had been led to feel himself a sinner, and was anxious for the
salvation of his soul, looked earnestly at the reader, and whispered
to himself, "Now I'll learn how to pray." The farmer read on, "God, I
thank Thee that I am not as other men are." "No, I am not," whispered
the Hottentot, "but I'm worse." Again the farmer read, "I fast twice
in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess." "I don't do that.
I don't pray in that way. What shall I do?" said the distressed
savage.

The good man read on till he came to the publican, "standing afar
off." "That's where I am," said the Hottentot. "Would not lift up so
much as his eyes unto heaven," read the farmer. "That's me," cried
his hearer. "But smote upon his breast saying, God be merciful to me
a sinner." "That's me; that's my prayer," cried the poor creature,
and smiting on his dark breast, he prayed for himself in the words of
the parable,--"God be merciful to me a sinner!" And he went on
offering this prayer till the loving Saviour heard and answered him,
and he went down to his house a saved and happy man.

Thus we see how this poor man learned the lesson of humility which
Jesus taught, and how much good it did to him.

And it is Jesus who is speaking to us and commanding us to learn this
lesson of humility, when we read, in other passages of Scripture,
such words as these:--"Put on therefore--humbleness of mind,
meekness, long-suffering." Col. iii: 12. "Humble yourself therefore
in the sight of God." James iv: 10. "Be clothed with humility." I.
Pet. v: 5. In all these places we have Jesus repeating his command to
us to learn the lesson of humility. And this command is urged thus
earnestly upon us because it is so important.

When St. Augustine, one of the celebrated fathers of the early
Church, was asked--What is the first important thing in the Christian
religion? his reply was--"Humility." "What is the second?"
"Humility." "And what is the third?"--the reply still was--"Humility."

And if this be true, we need not wonder that Jesus should have been
so earnest in teaching this lesson; or that he should have urged so
strongly on his disciples to learn it.

The _command_ of Christ is the first reason why we should learn the
lesson of humility.

_But the second reason why we should learn this lesson is, because of
the_--EXAMPLE--_of Christ_.

There are many persons "who say and do not." There are some ministers
who preach very well, but they do not _practise_ what they preach.
Such persons may well be compared to finger-boards. They point out
the way to others, but they do not walk in it themselves. But this
was not the case with our blessed Saviour. He practised everything
that he preached. And when he gave us his command to learn this
lesson of humility, he gave us, at the same time, his example to show
us _how_ to do it.

He was illustrating this command by his example when he washed his
disciples' feet. And this was only one out of many things in which he
set us this example. When he chose to be born of poor parents, he was
giving an example of humility. When he lived at Nazareth till he was
thirty years of age, working with his reputed father as a carpenter,
and during the latter part of the time, as is supposed, laboring for
the support of his mother, he was giving an example of humility. When
he said, "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister," Matt. xx: 28; and again--"I am among you as he that
serveth," Luke xxii: 27, he was giving an example of humility. When
he borrowed an ass to make his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem;
though he could say in truth, "every beast of the forest is mine, and
the cattle upon a thousand hills;"--(Ps. 1: 10), he was setting an
example of humility. When he hid himself away from the people because
he saw that they wanted to take him by force and make him king, he
was giving a lesson of humility. When he allowed himself to be taken
prisoner, though he knew that if he had asked his Father in heaven,
he would, at once, have sent "more than twelve legions of angels" to
deliver him, he was giving an example of humility. When he kept
silence, at the bar of the high-priest, of Herod, of Pontius Pilate,
like "a lamb dumb before her shearers," while his enemies were
charging him falsely with all kinds of wickedness; when he allowed
the Roman soldiers to scourge him with rods, till his back was all
bleeding; to put a crown of thorns upon his head; to array him in a
purple robe in mockery of his being a king; to smite him with the
palms of their hands, and spit upon him; and then to nail him to the
cross, and put him to the most shameful of all deaths--as if he were
a wicked man, who did not deserve to live--he was giving the most
wonderful example of humility that ever was heard of. Jesus, the Lord
of glory hanging on the shameful cross!--O, this was an example of
humility that must have filled the angels of heaven with surprise,
and wonder!

And when we think of all that Jesus did and suffered, to set us an
example of humility, it should make us ashamed of being proud; and
anxious, above all things, to learn this lesson which he did so much
to teach us.

"Imitating Christ's Humility." I think I never heard of a more
beautiful instance of persons learning to imitate the humility of
Christ, than is told of some Moravian Missionaries. These good men
had heard the story of the unhappy slaves in the West Indies. Those
poor creatures were wearing out their lives in hard bondage. They had
very little comfort in this life, and no knowledge of that gracious
Saviour who alone can secure, for sinful creatures, such as we are, a
better portion in the life to come. These missionaries offered to go
out to the West Indies, and teach those slaves about Jesus, and the
great salvation that is to be found in him. But they were told that
the owners of the slaves would not let them go to school or to
church. They would not allow them to take time enough from their work
to learn anything about the salvation of their souls. There was only
one way in which those poor slaves could be taught anything about
Jesus and his love, and that was, for those who wished to teach them,
to go and be slaves on the plantations, to work, and toil, if need
be, under the lash, so that they could get right beside them and then
tell them about the way of salvation that is in Christ Jesus. This
was a hard thing to undertake. But those good missionaries said they
were willing to do it. And they not only _said_ it, but _did_ it.
They left their homes, and went to the West Indies. They worked on
the plantations as slaves. And working thus, by the side of the
slaves, they got close to their hearts. The slaves heard them. Their
hearts were touched because these teachers of the gospel had humbled
themselves to their condition. While they were teaching the commands
of Christ, they were illustrating and following his example. How
beautiful this was! How grand! How glorious!

And yet Christ's own example was still more glorious. He laid aside
the glory of his Godhead, and came down from heaven to earth, that he
might get by our side. He laid himself beside us that we might feel
the throbbings of his bosom and the embrace of his loving arms; and
he draws us close to himself, while he whispers in our ears the sweet
words, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life."

And so, when we think of the example of Christ, we should strive to
learn the lesson of humility which he taught.

_A third reason why we should learn this lesson of humility is
because of the_--COMFORT--_that is found in it_.

Just think for a moment what God says on this subject, in Is. lvii:
15. These are his words:--"Thus saith the high and mighty One that
inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to
revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite ones." Here, the same loving Saviour who gave us the command
to learn the lesson of humility promises to give comfort to all who
learn this lesson. And the way in which he secures this comfort to
them is by coming and dwelling in their hearts. And who can tell
what a comfort it is for a poor pardoned sinner to have Jesus--the
Lord of heaven and earth--dwelling in his heart? It is his presence
in heaven which makes those who dwell there feel so happy. This is
what David taught, when he looked up to him, and said--"In thy
presence is fulness of joy." Ps. 16: 11. And when that presence is
felt, here on earth, it gives comfort and joy, as certainly as it
does in heaven. It was the presence of Jesus which enabled Paul and
Silas to sing at midnight, for very joyfulness, in the prison at
Philippi, though their feet were fastened in the stocks, and their
backs were torn and bleeding from the cruel scourging which they had
suffered. And it was this presence of Christ in the hearts of his
people that good John Newton was speaking of, in one of his sweet
hymns, when he said:

  "While blest with a sense of his love
    A palace a toy would appear;
  And prisons would palaces prove,
    If Jesus would dwell with me there."

But it is only those who learn the lesson of humility that Jesus will
dwell with. He says himself, "If any man love me, he will keep my
words; and My Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him." St. John xiv: 23. And among the words of
Christ which we must keep, if we wish him to dwell in our hearts, are
those in which he commands the lesson of humility. It is only the
humble with whom he will dwell. For "every one that is proud in heart
is an abomination unto the Lord." Prov. xvi: 5.

The reason why so many people are unhappy in this world is that they
do not learn the lesson of humility.

"Learn to Stoop." The story is told of some celebrated man--I think
it was Dr. Franklin--who had a friend visiting him on one occasion.
When the gentleman was about to leave, the doctor accompanied him to
the front door. In going through the entry there was a low beam
across it, which made it necessary to stoop, in order to avoid being
struck by it. As they approached it the doctor stooped himself, and
called out to his friend to do the same. He did not heed the caution,
and received a severe thump on his head as the result of his neglect.
In bidding him good-bye, the doctor said--"Learn to stoop, my friend;
and it will save you from many a hard knock, as you go on through
life." This illustrates the comfort which comes from learning the
lesson of humility. It is those who are unwilling to stoop; or to be
anything, or nothing, as God wants them to be, who have no comfort.

"The Fable of the Oak and the Violet." In a large garden there grew a
fine oak tree, with its wide-spreading branches, and at its foot
there grew a sweet and modest violet. The oak one day looked down in
scorn upon the violet, and said: "You, poor little thing, will soon
be dead and withered; for you have no strength, no size, and are of
no good to anyone. But I am large and strong; I shall still live for
ages, and then I shall be made into a large ship to sail on the
ocean, or into coffins to hold the dust of princes."

"Yes," answered the violet, in its humility, "God has given _you_
strength, and _me_ sweetness. I offer him back my fragrance, and am
thankful. I hope to die fragrantly, as I have lived fragrantly, but
we are both only what God made us, and both where God placed us."

Not long after the oak was struck by lightning and shivered to
splinters. Its end was to be burned. But the violet was gently
gathered by the hand of a Christian lady, who carefully pressed it,
and kept it for years, in the leaves of her Bible to refresh herself
with its fragrance. Here we see illustrated the difference between
pride and humility.

"The Secret of Comfort." Some years ago there was a boy who had been
lame from his birth. He was a bright intelligent boy, but he was not
a Christian. As he grew up, with no other prospect before him but
that of being a cripple all his days, he was very unhappy. As he sat
by his window, propped up in his chair, and saw the boys playing in
the street, he would say to himself: "Why has God made me thus? Why
have I not limbs to run and jump with like other boys?"

These thoughts filled him with distress, and caused him to shed many
bitter tears.

One day a Christian friend, who was visiting him, gave him a book and
requested him to read it. He did so; and it led to his becoming a
Christian. His heart was renewed; the burden of his sin was removed;
and the love of God was shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost.
He learned the lesson of humble submission to the will of God. After
this, as he looked out, and saw the young people happy at their
sports; or, as he gazed on the green earth and the beautiful sky, and
knew that he must remain a helpless cripple as long as he lived, he
yet could say, with the utmost cheerfulness:--"It's all right. My
Father in heaven has done it. I love him. He loves me. I know he is
making all things work together for my good." He had learned the
lesson we are now considering, and we see what comfort it gave him.
And the thought of the comfort which this lesson gives, should be a
good reason with us all for learning it.

_A fourth reason why we should learn the lesson of humility is
because of the_--USEFULNESS--_connected with it_.

Jesus tells us, by his apostle, that "God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace to the humble." St. James iv: 6. If we have the grace of
God we can be useful in many ways, but, without that grace we cannot
be useful at all. And this is what our Saviour taught his disciples,
when he said to them--"without me ye can do nothing." St. John xv: 5.
By the words "without _me_" he meant without my help, or without my
grace; or without the help of my grace. And it was of this grace that
St. Paul was speaking when he said--"I can do all things through
Christ who strengtheneth me." Phil, iv: 13.

And we could not possibly have a stronger reason for trying to learn
the lesson of humility than this, that our receiving the grace of
God, and consequently our usefulness, depends upon it. God will not
give us his grace to enable us to be truly good and to make ourselves
useful, unless we learn this lesson. And unless we have the grace of
God, we cannot be useful. Like barren fig-trees we shall be useless
cumberers of the ground.

Now let us look at one or two illustrations which show us how pride
hinders the usefulness of men, while humility helps it.

"The Fisherman's Mistake." An English gentleman was spending his
summer holidays in Scotland. He concluded to try his hand at fishing
for trout in one of the neighboring streams. He bought one of the
handsomest fishing rods he could find, with line and reel, and
artificial flies, and everything necessary to make a perfect outfit
for a fisherman. He went to the trout stream, and toiled all day, but
never caught a single fish.

Towards the close of the day he saw a ragged little farmer boy, with
a bean pole for a rod, and the simplest possible sort of a line, who
was nipping the fish out of the water about as fast as he could throw
his line in. He watched the boy in amazement for awhile, and then
asked him how it was that one, with so fine a rod and line, could
catch no fish, while he with his poor outfit was catching so many.
The boy's prompt reply was:--"Ye'll no catch ony fish Sir, as lang as
ye dinna keep yersel' oot o' sicht."

The gentleman was proud of his handsome rod and line, and was showing
it off all the time. His pride hindered his usefulness as a
fisherman. The farmer's boy had nothing to show off; so he kept
himself out of sight, and thus his humility helped his usefulness in
fishing.

"The Thames' Tunnel Teaching Humility." Most strangers who visit the
great city of London go to see the famous tunnel under the river
Thames. This is a large, substantial road that has been built, in the
form of an arch, directly under the bed of the river. It is one of
the most wonderful works that human skill ever succeeded in making.
The man who planned and built it was made one of the nobility of
England. His name was Sir Isambard Brunel. He was so humble that he
was willing to learn a lesson from a tiny little ship worm. These
worms bore small round holes through the solid timbers of our ships.

One day Mr. Brunel visited a ship-yard. An old ship was on the
dry-dock getting repaired. A quantity of worm-eaten timber had been
taken out from her sides. He picked up one of these pieces of timber,
and saw a worm at work, boring its way through. If he had been a
proud man, he might have thrown the timber aside, and said--"Get away
you poor little worm. I am a great master builder. You can't teach me
anything." And if he had done so that famous tunnel under the Thames
would probably never have been built. But Mr. Brunel had learned the
lesson of humility. He was willing to learn from anything that God
had made, however insignificant it might be. So he sat down and
watched the worm at its work. He said in reply:

"What letter?"
"The one you are going to give back to me."
Mederic now began to hesitate. The mayor's attitude did not strike
him as natural. There was perhaps a secret in that letter, a
political secret.

He knew Renardet was not a Republican, and he knew all the tricks
and chicanery employed at elections.

He asked:

"To whom is it addressed, this letter of yours?"

"To Monsieur Putoin, the magistrate--you know, my friend, Monsieur
Putoin!"
The postman searched through the papers and found the one asked for.

Then he began looking at it, turning it round and round between his
fingers, much perplexed, much troubled by the fear of either
committing a grave offence or of making an enemy of the mayor.

Seeing his hesitation, Renardet made a movement for the purpose of
seizing the letter and snatching it away from him. This abrupt
action convinced Mederic that some important secret was at stake
and made him resolve to do his duty, cost what it may.

So he flung the letter into his bag and fastened it up, with the
reply:

"No, I can't, Monsieur le Maire. As long as it is for the magistrate,
I can't."

A dreadful pang wrung Renardet's heart and he murmured:
"Why, you know me well.

You are even able to recognize my handwriting. I tell you I want that
paper."
"I can't."

"Look here, Mederic, you know that I'm incapable of deceiving you--I
tell you I want it."
"No, I can't."
A tremor of rage passed through Renardet's soul.

"Damn it all, take care! You know that I never trifle and that I could
get you out of your job, my good fellow, and without much delay,
either, And then, I am the mayor of the district, after all; and
I now order you to give me back that paper."

The postman answered firmly:

"No, I can't, Monsieur le Maire."
Thereupon Renardet, losing his head, caught hold of the postman's
arms in order to take away his bag; but, freeing himself by a
strong effort, and springing backward, the letter carrier raised
his big holly stick.

Without losing his temper, he said emphatically:

"Don't touch me, Monsieur le Maire, or I'll strike. Take care, I'm
only doing my duty!"

Feeling that he was lost, Renardet suddenly became humble, gentle,
appealing to him like a whimpering child:

"Look here, look here, my friend, give me back that letter and I'll
recompense you--I'll give you money. Stop! stop! I'll give you a
hundred francs, you understand--a hundred francs!"
The postman turned on his heel and started on his journey.

Renardet followed him, out of breath, stammering:

"Mederic, Mederic, listen! I'll give you a thousand francs, you
understand--a thousand francs."
The postman still went on without giving any answer.

Renardet went on:
"I'll make your fortune, you understand--whatever you wish--fifty
thousand francs--fifty thousand francs for that letter!

What does it matter to you? You won't? Well, a hundred thousand--I
say--a hundred thousand francs. Do you understand?
A hundred thousand francs--a hundred thousand francs."
The postman turned back, his face hard, his eye severe:
"Enough of this, or else I'll repeat to the magistrate everything
you have just said to me."

Renardet stopped abruptly. It was all over. He turned back and rushed
toward his house, running like a hunted animal.

Then, in his turn, Mederic stopped and watched his flight with
stupefaction. He saw the mayor reenter his house, and he waited still,
as if something astonishing were about to happen.

In fact, presently the tall form of Renardet appeared on the summit
of the Fox's tower. He ran round the platform like a madman. Then
he seized the flagstaff and shook it furiously without succeeding in
breaking it; then, all of a sudden, like a diver, with his two
hands before him, he plunged into space.

Mederic rushed forward to his assistance. He saw the woodcutters going
to work and called out to them, telling them an accident had occurred.
At the foot of the walls they found a bleeding body, its head
crushed on a rock. The Brindille surrounded this rock, and over its
clear, calm waters could be seen a long red thread of mingled
brains and blood.

THE DONKEY
There was not a breath of air stirring; a heavy mist was lying over the
river.

It was like a layer of cotton placed on the water. The banks themselves
were indistinct, hidden behind strange fogs. But day was breaking
and the hill was becoming visible. In the dawning light of day
the plaster houses began to appear like white spots. Cocks were crowing
in the barnyard.

On the other side of the river, hidden behind the fogs, just opposite
Frette, a slight noise from time to time broke the dead silence of the
quiet morning.

At times it was an indistinct plashing, like the cautious advance of
a boat, then again a sharp noise like the rattle of an oar and
then the sound of something dropping in the water. Then silence.

Sometimes whispered words, coming perhaps from a distance, perhaps
from quite near, pierced through these opaque mists.

They passed by like wild birds which have slept in the rushes and
which fly away at the first light of day, crossing the mist and
uttering a low and timid sound which wakes their brothers along the
shores.

Suddenly along the bank, near the village, a barely perceptible
shadow appeared on the water.

Then it grew, became more distinct and, coming out of the foggy curtain
which hung over the river, a flatboat, manned by two men, pushed up
on the grass.

The one who was rowing rose and took a pailful of fish from the bottom
of the boat, then he threw the dripping net over his shoulder.

His companion, who had not made a motion, exclaimed: "Say, Mailloche,
get your gun and see if we can't land some rabbit along the shore."

The other one answered: "All right. I'll be with you in a minute."
Then he disappeared, in order to hide their catch.

The man who had stayed in the boat slowly filled his pipe and lighted
it.
His name was Labouise, but he was called Chicot, and was in partnership
with Maillochon, commonly called Mailloche, to practice the doubtful
and undefined profession of junk-gatherers along the shore.

They were a low order of sailors and they navigated regularly only
in the months of famine.

The rest of the time they acted as junk-gatherers.
Rowing about on the river day and night, watching for any prey,
dead or alive, poachers on the water and nocturnal hunters, sometimes
ambushing venison in the Saint-Germain forests, sometimes looking
for drowned people and searching their clothes, picking up floating
rags and empty bottles; thus did Labouise and Maillochon live
easily.

At times they would set out on foot about noon and stroll along
straight ahead. They would dine in some inn on the shore and leave
again side by side. They would remain away for a couple of days;
then one morning they would be seen rowing about in the tub which
they called their boat.

At Joinville or at Nogent some boatman would be looking for his boat,
which had disappeared one night, probably stolen, while twenty or
thirty miles from there, on the Oise, some shopkeeper would be
rubbing his hands, congratulating himself on the bargain he had
made when he bought a boat the day before for fifty francs, which
two men offered him as they were passing.

Maillochon reappeared with his gun wrapped up in rags. He was a man
of forty or fifty, tall and thin, with the restless eye of people who
are worried by legitimate troubles and of hunted animals.

His open shirt showed his hairy chest, but he seemed never to have
had any more hair on his face than a short brush of a mustache and
a few stiff hairs under his lower lip.

He was bald around the temples. When he took off the dirty cap that
he wore his scalp seemed to be covered with a fluffy down, like
the body of a plucked chicken.

Chicot, on the contrary, was red, fat, short and hairy. He
looked like a raw beefsteak. He continually kept his left eye closed,
as if he were aiming at something or at somebody, and when
people jokingly cried to him, "Open your eye, Labouise!" he would
answer quietly: "Never fear, sister, I open it when there's cause
to."

He had a habit of calling every one "sister," even his scavenger
companion.

He took up the oars again, and once more the boat disappeared in the
heavy mist, which was now turned snowy white in the pink-tinted
sky.

"What kind of lead did you take, Maillochon?" Labouise asked.

"Very small, number nine; that's the best for rabbits."

  They were approaching the
    other shore so slowly, so
  quietly that no noise betrayed
    them.

This bank belongs to the Saint-Germain forest and is the boundary
line for rabbit hunting.

It is covered with burrows hidden under the roots of trees, and the
creatures at daybreak frisk about, running in and out of the
holes.

Maillochon was kneeling in the bow, watching, his gun hidden on
the floor. Suddenly he seized it, aimed, and the report echoed
for some time throughout the quiet country.

Labouise, in a few strokes, touched the beach, and his companion,
jumping to the ground, picked up a little gray rabbit, not yet dead.

Then the boat once more disappeared into the fog in order to get to
the other side, where it could keep away from the game wardens.

The two men seemed to be riding easily on the water. The weapon had
disappeared under the board which served as a hiding place and the
rabbit was stuffed into Chicot's loose shirt.

After about a quarter of an hour Labouise asked: "Well, sister, shall
we get one more?"
"It will suit me," Maillochon answered.

The boat started swiftly down the current. The mist, which was hiding
both shores, was beginning to rise. The trees could be barely perceived,
as through a veil, and the little clouds of fog were floating up
from the water. When they drew near the island, the end of which is
opposite Herblay, the two men slackened their pace and began to
watch.

Soon a second rabbit was killed.

Then they went down until they were half way to Conflans.

Here they stopped their boat, tied it to a tree and went to sleep
in the bottom of it.

From time to time Labouise would sit up and look over the horizon
with his open eye. The last of the morning mist had disappeared
and the large summer sun was climbing in the blue sky.

On the other side of the river the vineyard-covered hill stretched
out in a semicircle.

One house stood out alone at the summit. Everything was
silent.

Something was moving slowly along the tow-path, advancing with
difficulty. It was a woman dragging a donkey. The stubborn,
stiff-jointed beast occasionally stretched out a leg in answer to
its companion's efforts, and it proceeded thus, with outstretched
neck and ears lying flat, so slowly that one could not tell when
it would ever be out of sight.

The woman, bent double, was pulling, turning round occasionally
to strike the donkey with a stick.

As soon as he saw her, Labouise exclaimed: "Say, Mailloche!"
Mailloche answered: "What's the matter?"
"Want to have some fun?"
"Of course!"
"Then hurry, sister; we're going to have a laugh."
Chicot took the oars. When he had crossed the river he stopped opposite
the woman and called:

"Hey, sister!"
The woman stopped dragging her donkey and looked.

Labouise continued: "What are you doing--going to the locomotive
show?"

The woman made no reply. Chicot continued:

"Say, your trotter's prime for a race. Where are you taking him at
that speed?"
At last the woman answered: "I'm going to Macquart, at Champioux, to
have him killed. He's worthless."
Labouise answered: "You're right. How much do you think Macquart will
give you for him?"
The woman wiped her forehead on the back of her hand and hesitated,
saying: "How do I know? Perhaps three francs, perhaps four."
Chicot exclaimed: "I'll give you five francs and your errand's
done!
How's that?"
The woman considered the matter for a second and then exclaimed:
"Done!"

The two men landed. Labouise grasped the animal by the bridle. Maillochon
asked in surprise:

"What do you expect to do with that carcass?"
Chicot this time opened his other eye in order to express his gaiety.
His whole red face was grinning with joy.

He chuckled: "Don't worry, sister.
I've got my idea."

He gave five francs to the woman, who then sat down by the road to see
what was going to happen. Then Labouise, in great humor, got the
gun and held it out to Maillochon, saying: "Each one in turn; we're
going after big game, sister. Don't get so near or you'll kill it
right away! You must make the pleasure last a little."
He placed his companion about forty paces from the victim. The ass,
feeling itself free, was trying to get a little of the tall grass,
but it was so exhausted that it swayed on its legs as if it were about
to fall.

Maillochon aimed slowly and said: "A little pepper for the ears; watch,
Ghicot!" And he fired.

The tiny shot struck the donkey's long ears and he began to shake
them in order to get rid of the stinging sensation. The two men
were doubled up with laughter and stamped their feet with joy. The
woman, indignant, rushed forward; she did not want her donkey to be
tortured, and she offered to return the five francs. Labouise
threatened her with a thrashing and pretended to roll up his
sleeves. He had paid, hadn't he?
Well, then, he would take a shot at her skirts, just to show that
it didn't hurt. She went away, threatening to call the police. They
could hear her protesting indignantly and cursing as she went her
way.

Maillochon held out the gun to his comrade, saying: "It's your turn,
Chicot."

Labouise aimed and fired. The donkey received the charge in his
thighs, but the shot was so small and came from such a distance
that he thought he was being stung by flies, for he began to thrash
himself with his tail.
Labouise sat down to laugh more comfortably, while Maillochon
reloaded the weapon, so happy that he seemed to sneeze into the
barrel. He stepped forward a few paces, and, aiming at the same
place that his friend had shot at, he fired again. This time the
beast started, tried to kick and turned its head. At last a little
blood was running. It had been wounded and felt a sharp pain, for
it tried to run away with a slow, limping, jerky gallop.
Both men darted after the beast, Maillochon with a long stride,
Labouise with the short, breathless trot of a little man. But the
donkey, tired out, had stopped, and, with a bewildered look, was
watching his two murderers approach. Suddenly he stretched his neck
and began to bray.
Labouise, out of breath, had taken the gun. This time he walked
right up close, as he did not wish to begin the chase over again.
When the poor beast had finished its mournful cry, like a last call
for help, the man called: "Hey, Mailloche! Come here, sister; I'm
going to give him some medicine." And while the other man was forcing
the animal's mouth open, Chicot stuck the barrel of his gun down
its throat, as if he were trying to make it drink a potion. Then
he said: "Look out, sister, here she goes!"
He pressed the trigger. The donkey stumbled back a few steps, fell
down, tried to get up again and finally lay on its side and closed
its eyes:
The whole body was trembling, its legs were kicking as if it were,
trying to run. A stream of blood was oozing through its teeth. Soon
it stopped moving. It was dead.
The two men went along, laughing. It was over too quickly; they had
not had their money's worth. Maillochon asked: "Well, what are we
going to do now?"
Labouise answered: "Don't worry, sister. Get the thing on the boat;
we're going to have some fun when night comes."
They went and got the boat. The animal's body was placed on the
bottom, covered with fresh grass, and the two men stretched out on
it and went to sleep.
Toward noon Labouise drew a bottle of wine, some bread and butter
and raw onions from a hiding place in their muddy, worm-eaten boat,
and they began to eat.
When the meal was over they once more stretched out on the dead
donkey and slept. At nightfall Labouise awoke and shook his comrade,
who was snoring like a buzzsaw. "Come on, sister," he ordered.
Maillochon began to row. As they had plenty of time they went up
the Seine slowly. They coasted along the reaches covered with
water-lilies, and the heavy, mud-covered boat slipped over the lily
pads and bent the flowers, which stood up again as soon as they had
passed.
When they reached the wall of the Eperon, which separates the
Saint-Germain forest from the Maisons-Laffitte Park, Labouise stopped
his companion and explained his idea to him. Maillochon was moved
by a prolonged, silent laugh.
They threw into the water the grass which had covered the body,
took the animal by the feet and hid it behind some bushes. Then
they got into their boat again and went to Maisons-Laffitte.
The night was perfectly black when they reached the wine shop of
old man Jules. As soon as the dealer saw them he came up, shook
hands with them and sat down at their table. They began to talk of
one thing and another.She was clasping a beautiful wax doll to her bosom, and singing sweet
lullabies to it. But every little while she looked wistfully at her
mother. She was busy writing, and had told Alice to keep as quiet as
possible till she got through.

It seemed a long time to Alice; but after awhile her mother laid down
her pen, and pushed aside her papers, and said:--"Now I am through
for to-day, Alice, and you can make as much noise as you please."

In a moment Alice laid down her doll, and running to her mother,
threw her arms round her neck, and nestled sweetly in her loving
bosom.

"I'm so glad," said Alice, "I wanted to love you so much, mamma."

"Did you, darling?" and the mother clasped the little one tenderly in
her arms. "I am very glad that my little girl loves me;" replied her
mother, "but I thought you were not very lonely while I was writing;
you and dollie seemed to be having a good time together."

"Yes, we had, mamma; but I always get tired of loving dollie after
awhile."

"Do you, dear? Tell me why?"

"O, because she never loves me back again."

"And is _that_ why you love me?"

"That is _one why_, mamma; but not the first one, or the best one."

"And what is the first, and best?"

"Why, mamma, can't you guess?" and the little girl's blue eyes grew
very bright, as they gazed earnestly into her mother's face. "It's
because you loved me when I was too little to love you back; _that's_
why I love you so."

And what a reason this is why we should love Jesus! He loved us when
we were too little to love him back. The Bible says--"We love him
because _he first_ loved us." He loved us before we knew him, or had
ever heard of him. He loved us before we were born. Before the world
was made Jesus thought of you and me, and loved us. This is what he
means when he says:--"I _have loved thee with an everlasting love."_
Jer. xxxi: 3. This means a love that never had a beginning, and that
will never have an end. This is very wonderful. And when we think of
it, we may well sing out our thankfulness in the words of the hymn:

  "I am glad that our Father in heaven
  Tells of his love in the Book he has given;
  Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
  This is the sweetest, that Jesus loves me.
    I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
    Jesus loves--_even me_"

And when we think of all the kind words and actions of Jesus, by
which he showed his interest in little children, the first thing that
we see in them is--great love.

_Now, let us take another look at this part of our Saviour's life,
and the second thing that we see in it is_--GREAT WISDOM.

It is wise to take care of the children and try to bring them to
Jesus when young, _because then they are easily controlled_.

Suppose we plant an acorn in a corner of our garden. After awhile a
green shoot springs out from it. We go to look at it when it is about
a foot high. We find it getting crooked; but with the gentlest touch
of thumb and finger, we can straighten it out. We wish it to lean in
a particular direction. We give it a slight touch, and it leans just
that way. Afterwards we conclude to have it lean in the opposite
direction. Another slight touch, and it takes that direction. It is
true, as the poet says, "Just as the twig is bent, the tree's
inclined." But, suppose we let it grow for twenty or thirty years,
and then come back to it. It is now a great oak tree. There is an
ugly twist in its trunk. We try to straighten it out; but in vain. No
power on earth can do that now. You can cut it down; or saw it up; or
break it into splinters; but you cannot straighten it.

Suppose, that you and I should go to one of the highest summits of
the Rocky Mountains. In a certain place there, we should find two
little fountains springing up near each other. With the end of a
finger we might trace the course in which either of those little
springs should flow. We could lead one down the eastern side of the
mountains, and the other down the western side. It would be very easy
to control them then. But suppose now we travel down the side of the
mountain till we reach the plain, at its base. Now see, yonder is a
great river, rolling on its mighty flood of waters. That is what the
little spring has grown to. It is too late to control it now. The
time for controlling it was up yonder near the spring.

It is easy to control the spring; it is very hard to control the
river. Jesus wished to control the spring when he directed us to
bring the children to him. And in this he showed his wisdom.

It is wise to take an interest in children, and bring them early to
Jesus--_because they have great influence in the world_.

Who can tell the influence that children are exerting in the world?
We have an illustration of this in the words that were once spoken by
Themistocles, the celebrated Grecian governor and general. He had a
little boy, of whom his mother was very fond and over whom the child
had very great influence. His father pointed to him, one day, and
said to a friend, "Look at that child; he has more power than all
Greece. For the city of Athens rules Greece; I rule Athens; that
child's mother rules me, and he rules his mother."

I feel sure our Saviour must have felt very much as some one has
done, who writes in this way about

THE GOOD THAT CHILDREN DO.

  "A dreary place would be this earth
    Were there no little people in it;
  The song of life would lose its mirth
    Were there no children to begin it;

  "No little forms, like buds to grow,
    And make the admiring heart surrender;
  No little hands, on breast and brow,
    To keep the thrilling love-chords tender.

  "No babe within our arms to leap,
    No little feet towards slumber tending;
  No little knee in prayer to bend,
    Our loving lips the sweet words lending.

  "Life's song indeed would lose its charm,
    Were there no babies to begin it;
  A doleful place this world would be,
    Were there no little people in it."

And if children have so great an influence in the world it was wise
in Jesus to desire to have them brought early to him that they might
learn to use that influence in the best possible way.

And then it was wise in Jesus to desire this, again, _because
bringing children to him prevents great trouble, and secures great
blessing_.

We are all familiar with Dr. Watts' sweet hymn, which says:

"'Twill save us from a thousand snares
  To mind religion young."

Here is a striking illustration of this truth in the history of:

"One Neglected Child." A good many years ago, in one of the upper
counties of New York, there was a little girl named Margaret. She
was not brought to Christ, but was turned out on the world to do as
she pleased. She grew up to be perhaps the wickedest woman in that
part of the country. She had a large family of children, who became
about as wicked as herself; her descendants have been a plague and a
curse to that county ever since. The records of that county show that
two hundred of her descendants have been criminals. In a single
generation of her descendants there were twenty children. Three of
these died in infancy. Of the remaining seventeen, who lived to grow
up, nine were sent to the state prison for great crimes; while all
the others were found, from time to time, in the jails, the
penitentiaries, or the almshouses. Nearly all the descendants of this
woman were idiots, or drunkards, or paupers, or bad people, of the
very worst character. That one neglected child thus cost the county
in which she lived hundreds of thousands of dollars, besides the
untold evil that followed from the bad examples of her descendants.
How different the result would have been if this poor child had been
brought to Jesus and made a Christian when she was young!

"The Result of Early Choice." Here is a short story of two boys, of
the choice they made when young, and the different results that
followed from that choice.

A minister of the gospel was preaching on one occasion to the
convicts in the state prison of Connecticut. As he rose in the desk
and looked around on the congregation, he saw a man there whose face
seemed familiar to him. When the service was over he went to this
man's cell, to have some conversation with him.

"I remember you very well, sir," said the prisoner. "We were boys in
the same neighborhood; we went to the same school; sat beside each
other on the same bench, and then my prospects were as bright as
yours. But, at the age of fourteen, you made choice of the service of
God, and became a Christian. I refused to come to Christ, but made
choice of the world and sin. And now, you are a happy and honored
minister of the gospel, while I am a wretched outcast. I have served
ten years in this penitentiary and am to be a prisoner here for
life."

Jesus knew what blessings would follow to those who were early
brought to him, and we see that there was great wisdom in the words
that he spake when he said--"Suffer the little children to come unto
me."

_In the next place there was_--GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT--_in what Jesus
did and said about children_.

If a company of boys or girls should try to get into the presence of
a monarch, some great king, or emperor, they would find it a pretty
hard thing to do. At the door of the palace they would meet with
soldiers or servants, the guards of the queen or king. They would say
to the children--"what do you want here?" And if the children should
say, "Please sir, we wish to go into the palace and see the queen,"
the answer would be: "Go away; go away. The queen is too busy. She
has no time to attend to little folks like you." And the children
would have to go away without getting to see the queen.

But, Jesus is a greater king than any who ever sat upon an earthly
throne. He has more to do than all the kings and queens in the world
put together. And yet he never gave orders to the angels, or to any
of his servants to keep the children away from him. On his great
throne in yonder heavens he says still, what he said when he was on
earth--"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them
not." And he says this on purpose to encourage the children to come
to him. And the thought that Jesus loves them and feels an interest
in them has encouraged multitudes of little ones to seek him and
serve him. Here are some illustrations of this:

"Learning to Love Jesus." "A little girl came to me one day," said a
minister of the gospel, and said, "'Please sir, may I speak to you a
minute?' I saw that she was in some trouble; so I took her kindly by
the hand, and said, 'Certainly, my child. What do you wish to say?'

"'Please, sir,' said she, as her lip quivered and tears filled her
eyes, 'it's a dreadful thing; but I don't love Jesus.'

"'And are you not going to love him?' I asked.

"'I don't know; but please sir, I want you to tell me how.' She spoke
sadly, as if it was something she never could do.

"'Well,' I said, 'St. John, who loved our Lord almost more than any
one else ever did, says that "we love him because he first loved us."
Now if you go home to-night, saying in your heart, "_Jesus loves
me_," I think that to-morrow you will be able to say--"I love
Jesus."'

"She looked up through her tears, and repeated the words very softly,
'Jesus loves me.' She began to think about it on her way home, as
well as to say it. She thought about his life, about his death on the
cross, and about his sweet words to the little ones, and she began to
feel it too.

"The next evening she came to see me again; and, putting both her
hands in mine, with a bright happy face, she said:

"'Oh! please sir, I love Jesus now; for I know he does love me so!'"

Here was a little one encouraged to come to Jesus by thinking of the
interest he feels in children.

"Doesn't He Love to Save?" A mother had just tucked her little boy in
bed, and had received his good-night kisses. She lingered awhile, at
his bedside, to speak to him about Jesus, and to see if he was
feeling right toward him. He was a good, obedient boy, but that day
he had done something that grieved his mother. He had expressed his
sorrow for it, and asked his mother's forgiveness. As she stooped
down for the last kiss, he said--"Is it all settled, mother?"

"Yes, my child," she said, "it's all settled with me; but have you
settled it all with Jesus?" "Yes, mother: I've asked him to forgive
me: and I believe him when he says he will; for _doesn't he love to
help and save children_?" "He does, my child, he does," said his
mother, as she gazed on his happy little face, lighted up with the
joy of that gospel, so often hidden from the wise and prudent, but
revealed to babes.

Here we see how this little fellow was encouraged to seek Jesus from
the assurance that he feels an interest in children, and loves to
help and bless them.

"Love Leads to Love." A little boy named Charley stood at the window
with his mother one morning, watching the robins as they enjoyed
their morning meal of cherries from the tree near their house.
"Mother," said Charley, "How the birdies all love father."

"They do," said his mother, "but what do you suppose is the reason
that the birdies love your father?"

This question seemed to set Charley to thinking. He did not answer at
first, but presently he said, "Why mother all the creatures seem to
love father. My dog is almost as glad to see him as to see me. Pussy,
you know, always comes to him, and seems to know exactly what he is
saying. Even the old cow follows him around the meadow, and the other
day I saw her licking his hand, just as a dog would. I think it must
be because father loves them. You know he will often get up and give
pussy something to eat; and he pulls carrots for the cow, and pats
her; and somehow I think his voice never sounds so sweet as when he
is talking to these dumb creatures."

"I think his voice is very pleasant when he is talking to his little
boy," said his mother.

Charley smiled, and said, "That's so, mother. Father loves me, and I
love him dearly. But he loves the birdies too I am sure. He whistles
to them every morning when they are eating their cherries, and they
don't seem a bit afraid of him, although he is near enough to catch
them. Mother I wish everything loved me as they do father."

"Do as father does, Charley, and they will. Love all things and be
kind to them. Don't kick the dog, or speak roughly to him. Don't pull
pussy's tail, nor chase the hens, nor try to frighten the cow. Never
throw stones at the birds. Never hurt nor tease anything. Speak
gently and lovingly to them and they will love you, and everybody
that knows you will love you too."

Now Charley's father, in acting as he did, was trying to make all the
dumb creatures about him know that he was their friend; that he loved
them, and had nothing but kindness in his heart towards them. In
this way he encouraged them to come to him, and not be afraid of him.

And this is just the way in which Jesus was acting when he did and
said so much to show his interest in children. He wants them all to
understand that he is their friend; that he loves them, and wants
them to come to him and love and serve him. And so every child who
hears or reads about Jesus may feel encouraged to say:

  "Once in his arms the Saviour took
    Young children just like me,
  And blessed them with his voice and look
    As kind as kind could be.

  "And though to heaven the Lord hath gone,
    And seems so far away,
  He hath a smile for every one
    That doth his voice obey.

  "I'd rather be the least of them
    That he will bless and own,
  Than wear a royal diadem,
    And sit upon a throne."

And so we may well say that in what Jesus did and said about the
children there is great encouragement.

_And then there are_--GREAT LESSONS--_too, in this part of the life
of Christ_.

There are two lessons taught us here. One is about _the work we are
to do for Jesus here on earth_. When Jesus said to Peter, "Lovest
thou me? Feed my lambs," he meant to teach him, and you, and me, and
all his people everywhere, the best way in which we can show our love
to him. The lambs of Christ here spoken of mean little children,
wherever they are found. And to feed these lambs is to teach them
about Jesus. When we are trying to bring the young to Jesus and
teaching them to love and serve him, then we are doing the work that
is most pleasing to him:--the work that he most loves to have his
people do. It was thinking about this that first led me to begin the
work of preaching regularly to the young. And this is the lesson that
Jesus would have all his people learn when he says to each of
them:--"Lovest thou me? Feed my lambs."

"The Angel in the Stone." Many years ago there was a celebrated
artist who lived in Italy, whose name was Michael Angelo. He was a
great painter, and a great sculptor, or a worker in marble. He loved
to see beautiful figures chiseled out of marble, and he had great
power and skill in chiseling out such figures. One day, as he was
walking with some friends through the city of Florence, he saw a
block of marble lying neglected in a yard, half covered with dust and
rubbish. He stopped to examine that block of marble. That day
happened to be a great holiday in Florence and the artist had his
best suit of clothes on; but not caring for this he threw off his
coat, and went to work to clear away the rubbish from that marble.
His friends were surprised. They said to him:--"Come on, let's go;
what's the use of wasting your time on that good-for-nothing lump of
stone?"

"O, there's an angel in this stone," said he, "and I must get it
out."

He bought that block; had it removed to his studio, and then went to
work with his mallet and his chisel, and never rested till out of
that rough, unshapen mass of stone he made a beautiful marble angel.

Now, every child born into our world is like such a block of marble.
The only difference is that children are living stones--marble that
will last forever. And when we bring our children to Jesus, and by
his help teach them to love and serve him, we are doing for them just
what Michael Angelo was doing for his block of marble--we are getting
the angels out of the stones. And this is what Jesus loves to have us
do.

"How to Get the Angels Out." A Christian mother, whose children had
all been early taught to love and serve Jesus, was asked the secret
of her success in bringing up her children. This was her
answer:--"While my children were infants on my lap, as I washed them
day by day, I raised my heart to God that he would wash them in that
blood which cleanseth from all sin; as I clothed them in the morning,
I asked my heavenly Father to clothe them with the robe of Christ's
righteousness; as I provided them food I prayed that God would feed
their souls with the bread of heaven, and give them to drink of the
water of life. When I prepared them for the house of God I pleaded
that their bodies might be made fit temples for the Holy Ghost to
dwell in. When they left me daily for the week-day school, I followed
their youthful footsteps with the prayer that their path through life
might be like that of the just, which shineth more and more unto the
perfect day. And night after night, as I committed them to rest, the
silent breathing of my soul has been, that their heavenly Father
would take them under his tender care and fold them in his loving,
everlasting arms."

Let Christian mothers follow this example and they will not fail to
bring the angel out from every block of living marble that God has
given them.

"The Best Time for Doing This." A faithful minister of Christ had a
dear only daughter. She had been a thoughtful praying child. When
only twelve years old she had joined her father's church. She now lay
on her dying bed. "As I sat by her bedside," says her father, "among
the things she said which I shall never forget were these:--'Father
you know I joined the church when I was young--very young. Some of
our friends thought that I was too young. But, oh! how I wish I could
tell everybody what a comfort it is to me now to think of it.' Then
reaching out her hand--the fingers were already cold--and grasping
mine, she said with great earnestness:--'Father, you are at work for
the young. Do all you can for them while they are young. It's the
best time--the best time. Oh! I see it now as I never did before. It
is the best time--while they are young--the younger the better. Do
all you can for them while they are very young.' And then she fell
asleep in Jesus."

This is the lesson about the work we are to do for him on earth, that
Jesus taught in what he said concerning the children.

But when we think of those sweet words of Jesus--"Of such is the
kingdom of heaven," we are _taught a lesson about the company we
shall meet there_. We learn from what our blessed Lord says on this
subject that he saves all the little ones who die before they are
accountable for their actions. And we know that of all the persons
born into our world more than half of them die before they reach this
age. And this makes it very certain that more than half the company
of heaven will be made up of little children. This is a very sweet
thought to those who have lost little ones; and to those who love
them.

And some people think that when young children die and go to heaven,
they will not grow up to be men and women, but will always remain
children. The Rev. Mr. Bickersteth, of England, in speaking of a
father meeting his little ones in heaven, who died years before he
did, represents him as meeting them there, just of the same age and
size as they were when they died. And then he expresses his own
thought on this subject in a single line:

    "A babe in glory, is a babe forever."

But God has not said anything on this subject in the Bible. And when
he himself has not spoken on such a point as this, it is impossible
for us to say certainly which way it will be. But when we get to
heaven and find just how it is, we shall all agree that God's way is
the best way.

And then Jesus shows us plainly _what our character must be if we
hope to go to heaven and join the happy company there_.

These are the words he spake on this subject; "Verily I say unto you,
whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he
shall not enter therein." Mark x: 15. Jesus refers here to some of
the best things that we find marking the character of a good child.
Such a child is gentle, and loving, and kind; and this must be our
character, if we hope to enter heaven. Such a child is willing to be
taught:--believes all that his parent or teacher tells him; and does
everything that he is told to do; and such must our character be if
we hope to enter heaven.

And so when we come to study out this part of our Saviour's life, and
think of all that he did and said to show his interest in children,
we see these four great things in it: viz., great love; great wisdom;
great encouragement; and great lessons.

I know not how to express in a better way the feelings which should
be in the heart of everyone, young or old, on thinking of this great
subject, than in the words of one who has thus sweetly written:

    "Lamb of God! I look to Thee,
    Thou shalt my example be;
    Thou art gentle, meek and mild;
    Thou wast once a little child.

    "Fain I would be as Thou art,
    Give me thy obedient heart:
    Thou art pitiful, and kind;
    Let me have thy loving mind.

    "Let me above all fulfill
    God my heavenly Father's will;
    Never his good Spirit grieve,
    Only to his glory live.

    "Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb!
    In thy gracious hands I am;
    Make me, Saviour, what Thou art;
    Live thyself within my heart.

    "I shall then show forth thy praise;
    Serve thee all my happy days;
    Then the world shall always see
    Christ, the Holy Child in me."


THE TRANSFIGURATION


This was one of the most surprising scenes in the life of our blessed
Lord. It forms a great contrast to the other events mentioned in his
history. He "came to visit us in great humility." When we read how he
was born in a stable, and cradled in a manger; how he had "not where
to lay his head;" when we read of the lowliness, and poverty, and
suffering that marked his course, day by day, we come naturally to
think of him as "the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief." And
though, when we remember how he healed the sick, and cast out devils,
and raised the dead to life again; how he walked upon the waters, and
controlled the stormy winds and waves with his simple word, he seems
wonderful in his power and majesty; yet there is nothing, in all his
earthly life, that leads us to think so highly of him, as this scene
of the Transfiguration, of which we are now to speak.

The account of this event is given us by three of the evangelists. We
find it described by St. Matt, xvii: 1-13. St. Mark ix: 2-13. St.
Luke ix: 28-29.

A short time before this took place, Jesus had told his disciples how
he was to go up to Jerusalem, to suffer many things, to be put to
death, be buried, and be raised again on the third day. St. Matt,
xvi: 21. He also told them of the self-denial, which all who became
his disciples would be required to exercise. This was very different
from what they were expecting and must have been very discouraging to
them. They did not yet understand that their Master had come into the
world to suffer and to die. Instead of this, their minds were filled
with the idea that the object of his coming was to establish an
earthly kingdom and to reign in glory. And, for themselves, they were
expecting that they would share his glory and reign as princes with
him. And so they must have been greatly troubled by his words. To
encourage and comfort them, therefore, he told them that, before they
died, some of them should "see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."

And then, some days after this, he took three of his disciples, the
favored John and James and Peter, and went up with them "into a
mountain, apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them." We
are not told what mountain it was that was thus honored. Mount Tabor,
near Nazareth, on the borders of the Plain of Esdraelon, has long
been regarded as the favored spot. But, in our day, many persons
think that it was not on the top of Tabor, but on one of the summits
of Mount Hermon, where this wonderful event took place. One of the
principal objections to supposing that Tabor was the place is, that
in those days there was a large fortress on the top of this mountain,
and this, they think, would interfere with the privacy that would be
desired on such an occasion. But, for myself, I still incline to
think that Tabor was the mountain chosen. I went to the top of this
mountain, when in Palestine. And though there is a large convent
there now, yet the summit of Tabor covers a wide space of ground. And
outside of the walls of the convent, and even out of sight of its
walls, I saw a number of retired, shady places that would be
particularly suitable for such a scene as this.

But, it is impossible to decide positively which was the Mount of
Transfiguration. And it is not a matter of much consequence. Those
who think it was Hermon are at liberty to think so; and those who
think it was Tabor, have a right to their opinion, for none can prove
that they are mistaken in thinking so.

And when we come to consider this great event in the life of our
Saviour, there are _two_ things to speak of in connection with it;
these are the _wonders_ we see in it; and the _lessons_ we may learn
from it. Or, to express it more briefly--The Transfiguration--its
wonders, and its lessons.

There are three wonders to be spoken of, and three lessons to be
learned from this subject.

_The first wonder is_--THE WONDERFUL CHANGE--that took place in the
appearance of our Lord on this occasion.

Jesus went up the mountain with his disciples. It was probably at the
close of one of his busy days that he did this. It would seem from
St. Luke's account,--chap. ix: 32--that Peter and his companions were
weary with the day's work, and soon fell asleep. But, while they were
sleeping, Jesus was praying. And it was while he was engaged in
prayer that the Transfiguration took place. St. Luke tells us it
was--"_as he prayed_."

Let us notice now, what the different evangelists tell us about this
change. St. Matthew says--"He was transfigured before them: and his
face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light."
St. Mark says, "His raiment became exceeding white as snow, so as no
fuller"--one who cleans, or whitens cloth--"on earth can white them."
St. Luke says--"As he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was
altered, and his raiment was white and glistening."

These are the different accounts we have of this surprising scene. If
the disciples had been awake when this marvellous change began to
take place, we cannot for a moment suppose that they would have gone
to sleep while the heavens must have seemed to be opening above them
and this blaze of glory was shining around them. They were, no doubt,
asleep when the transfiguration began. And, as we know that the
taking of an ordinary light into the room where persons are asleep
will often awaken them, it is not surprising that the disciples
should have been aroused from their slumber by the flood of light and
glory that was beaming round their Master then. How surprised they
must have been when they opened their eyes on that scene! They would
never forget it as long as they lived. It was more than half a
century after this when St. John wrote his gospel; and it was, no
doubt, to this scene that he referred when he said, in speaking of
Jesus;--"_we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
the Father_" St. John i: 14. And, not long before his death, St.
Peter thus refers to it:--"We were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For
he received from God the Father, honor and glory, when there came
such a voice from the excellent glory, saying, This is my beloved Son
in whom I am well pleased." II. Pet. i: 16, 17.

One object for which this wonderful transfiguration of our Lord took
place was, no doubt, to give to the disciples then, and to the
followers of Jesus in all coming time, an idea of what his glory now
is in heaven, and of what it will be when he shall come again in his
kingdom. He had told his disciples about his sufferings and death,
and the shame and dishonor connected with them; and here, as if to
counterbalance that, he wished to give them a glimpse of the glory
that is to shine around him forever.

How wonderful it must have seemed to the astonished disciples! When
they had last looked on their Master, before going to sleep, they had
seen him as "the man of sorrows," in his plain everyday dress, such
as they themselves wore: but, when they looked on him again, as they
awoke from their sleep, they saw his face shining as the sun, and his
raiment dazzling in its snowy whiteness.

To what may we compare this wonderful change? Suppose you have before
you the bulbous root of the lily plant. You look at it carefully, but
there is nothing attractive about it. How rough and unsightly it
appears! You close your eyes upon it for a brief space. You open them
again. But what a change has taken place! That plain-homely looking
bulb has disappeared, and in its place there stands before you the
lily plant. It has reached its mature growth. Its flower is fully
developed and blooming in all its matchless beauty! What a marvellous
change that would be! And yet it would be but a feeble illustration
of the more wonderful change that took place in our Saviour at his
transfiguration.

Here is another illustration. Suppose we are looking at the western
sky, towards the close of day. Great masses of dark clouds are
covering all that part of the heavens. They are but common clouds.
There is nothing attractive or interesting about them. We do not care
to take a second look at them. We turn from them for a little while,
and then look at them again. In the meantime, the setting sun has
thrown his glorious beams upon them. How changed they now appear! All
that was commonplace and unattractive about them is gone. How they
glow and sparkle! Gold, and purple, and all the colors of the rainbow
are blending, how beautifully there! Are these the same dull clouds
that we looked upon a few moments before? Yes; but they have been
transfigured. A wonderful change has come over them. And here we have
an illustration of our Lord's transfiguration. The first wonder about
this incident in his life is the wonderful change which took place in
his appearance then.

_The second wonder about the transfiguration is_--THE WONDERFUL
COMPANY--_that appeared with our Saviour then_.

At the close of his temptation in the wilderness, Jesus had some
wonderful company too, but it was different from what he had now.
_Then_, we are told that "_angels came, and ministered unto him_."
And in the garden of Gethsemane, when he was sinking to the earth,
overcome by the terrible agony through which he was passing, he had
more company of the same kind; for we read that--"_there appeared
unto him an angel from heaven strengthening him."_ St. Luke xxii: 43.
But it was not the company of angels that waited on him at the time
of his Transfiguration. No: but we read that, "there appeared unto
him Moses, and Elias," or Elijah. And if we ask why did not the
angels come to him now, as they did on other occasions? Why did these
distinguished persons, of the Old Testament history, come from heaven
to visit him in place of the angels? It is easy enough to answer
these questions. This transfiguration of Christ took place, as he
himself tells us, in order to give his disciples a view of the glory
that will attend him when he shall come in his kingdom. When he shall
appear, on that occasion, all his people will come with him. Those
who shall have died before he comes will be raised from the dead and
come with him, in their glorious resurrection bodies. And those who
shall be living when he comes will, as St. Paul tells us,--"_be
changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye_"--I. Cor. xv: 52,
53--and have beautiful, glorified bodies, like the bodies of those
who have been raised from the dead. And both these classes of
Christ's people were represented by the distinguished persons who
formed the company that appeared with Jesus at the Transfiguration.
Moses had been in heaven nearly fifteen hundred years when this scene
took place. He had died, as other men do, and had been buried. It is
supposed by many wise and good men that his body had been raised from
the dead, that he might appear in it on this occasion. And thus Moses
represented all the dead in Christ, who will be raised to life again
at his coming. Elijah had been in heaven for almost a thousand years.
He had never died, and never lain in the grave. He was translated.
This means that he was taken up to heaven without dying. But St. Paul
tells us that bodies of flesh and blood, like ours, cannot enter
heaven. I. Cor. xv: 50. They must be changed, and made fit for that
blessed place. And so, we know, that as Elijah went up to heaven, in
his chariot of fire, the same wonderful change must have passed over
his body which we have seen will take place with those of Christ's
people who shall be living on the earth when he comes again.

Jesus was transfigured that we might know how he himself will appear
when he comes in his kingdom. And Moses and Elias "appeared with him
in glory," to show us how the people of Christ will appear when they
enter with him into his kingdom. And this was a good reason why these
very persons, and not the angels, should have formed the company that
came to visit our Saviour on the Mount of Transfiguration. It was
wonderful company indeed that waited on Jesus then. But, it was a
wonderful occasion. None like it had ever occurred before; none like
it has ever occurred since; and none like it will ever occur again
till Jesus shall come in the glory of his heavenly kingdom. The
second wonder of the Transfiguration was the wonderful company.

_The third wonder connected with this great event was_--THE WONDERFUL
CONVERSATION--_that took place between Jesus and his visitors_.

All the three evangelists, who tell of the Transfiguration, speak of
this conversation. St. Matthew and St. Mark merely state the fact
that Moses and Elias "were talking with Jesus;" but they do not tell
us the subject of the conversation, or what it was about which they
talked. But St. Luke supplies what they leave out. He says, "_they
spake of his decease, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem_" This
means that they talked about the death upon the cross which he was to
suffer. And when we remember that these great and good men had just
come down from heaven, where God, the loving Father of Jesus dwells,
and where all the holy angels are; and that this was the only time
when they were to be present with Jesus, and have an opportunity of
talking with him, during all his life on earth, we may wonder why
they did not choose some more pleasant subject of conversation. And
yet they did not make a mistake. God the Father had sent them from
heaven to meet his beloved Son on this occasion. And, no doubt, he
had told them what subject they were to talk about, and what they
were to say to Jesus, on that subject. And then they knew very well
how Jesus felt about this matter. And painful as the death upon the
cross would be, they knew it was the nearest of all things to the
heart of Jesus. It was the will of his Father that he should die on
the cross, and it was the delight of his heart--the very joy of his
soul to do his Father's will. And here we learn the unspeakable
importance of the death of Christ. The apostle Paul was showing his
sense of its importance when he said, "God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus." Gal. vi: 14. He puts the
word "_cross_" of Christ, for the death of Christ, but it means the
same thing.

Some one has compared the cross of Christ to a key of gold, that
opens the gate of heaven to us, if we believe in Jesus; but if we
refuse to hear and obey the words of Jesus, it becomes a key of iron,
and opens the gate of destruction before us.

"The Power of the Cross." A heathen ruler had heard the story of the
cross and desired to know its power. When he was sick and near his
end, he told his servants to make him a large wooden cross, and lay
it down in his chamber. When this was done, he said--"Take me now and
lay me on the cross, and let me die there." As he lay there dying he
looked in faith to the blood of Christ, that was shed upon the cross,
and said--_"It lifts me up: it lifts me. Jesus saves me!_" and thus
he died. It was not that wooden cross that saved him; but the death
of Christ, on the cross to which he was nailed--the death of which
Moses and Elias talked with him, that saved this heathen man. They
knew what a blessing his death would be to the world, and _this_ was
why they talked about this death. Here is one of Bonar's beautiful
hymns which speaks sweetly of the blessedness and comfort to be found
in the cross of Christ.

  "Oppressed with noonday's scorching heat,
    To this dear cross I flee;
  And in its shelter take my seat;
    No _shade_ like this to me!

  "Beneath this cross clear waters burst;
    A fountain sparkling free;
  And here I quench my desert thirst,
    No _spring_ like this to me.

  "A stranger here, I pitch my tent
    Beneath this spreading tree;
  Here shall my pilgrim life be spent,
    No _home_ like this to me!

  "For burdened ones a resting place
    Beside this cross I see;
  Here, I cast off my weariness;
    No _rest_ like this for me!"

Moses and Elias understood how the blessing of the world was to flow
out from that death upon the cross which Jesus was to suffer; and so,
we need not wonder that during the short visit which they made to
Jesus, amidst the glory of his Transfiguration, the subject, above
all others, about which they desired to talk with him--was his death
upon the cross,--"his decease, which he should accomplish at
Jerusalem."

These are the three great wonders of the Transfiguration--the
wonderful change--the wonderful company--and the wonderful
conversation.

And this brings us to the second part of our subject, which is--_the
three lessons_ taught by the Transfiguration.

_The first of these is_--THE LESSON OF HOPE.

One thing for which the Transfiguration took place was to show us
what we may hope to be hereafter, if we are the servants of Christ.
We are told how Jesus appeared on this occasion. His glory is
described. The brightness and glory that shone around him exceeded
that of the noonday sun. But there is no particular description given
Moses and Elias. We are not told how they looked. It is only said of
them that--"they appeared in _glory_." St Luke ix: 31. I suppose the
meaning of this is that they shared in the glory which Jesus himself
had when he was transfigured. Their raiment was as white as his; and
the same brightness and beauty beamed forth from their faces which
made his so glorious. They shared their Master's glory. And, if we
are loving, and serving Jesus, this is what we may hope to share
with him hereafter. This is what we are taught to pray for in the
beautiful Collect for the sixth Sunday after the Epiphany. These are
the words of that prayer: "O God, whose blessed Son was manifested
that he might make us the sons of God, and heirs of eternal life;
Grant us, we beseech thee, that having this hope, we may purify
ourselves, even as he is pure; that when he shall appear again, with
power and great glory, _we may be made like unto him in his eternal
and glorious kingdom;_ where, with thee, O Father, and thee, O Holy
Ghost, he liveth and reigneth, ever One God, world without end.
Amen."

And it is right to offer such a prayer as this, because the Bible
teaches us to hope for this great glory. How well a hope like this
may be called "_a hope that maketh not ashamed_," Rom. v: 5; "_a good
hope through grace_," II. Thess. ii: 16; "that _blessed hope_," Tit.
ii: 13; "_a lively hope_," I. Peter i: 3. And how well it may be
spoken of as "_a helmet_"--to cover the head in the day of battle;
and as "an anchor" to keep the soul calm and steadfast when the
storms of life are bursting upon it! Moses and Elias appeared with
Jesus at his Transfiguration, and shared his glory on purpose to
teach us this lesson of hope, and to show us what we shall be
hereafter. We shall be as glorious as Jesus was on the Mount of
Transfiguration! This seems something too great and too good to be
true. But no matter how great, or how good it is--_it is true_. Jesus
taught this lesson of hope when he said--speaking of the time when he
shall come in his kingdom, "_Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father_," St. Matt, xiii: 43. He
taught us the same lesson, in his prayer to his Father, when he said,
speaking of all his people, "_And the glory which thou gavest me, I
have given them_," St. John xvii: 21. And the apostle John taught us
the same lesson, when he said,--"We know that when he shall appear
_we shall be like him_," I. John iii: 2. These sweet passages make
this lesson of hope very sure. And this is just the way in which we
are made sure about other things we have not seen.

"How we Know There is a Heaven." A Sunday-school teacher was talking
to one of her scholars about heaven and the glory we shall have when
we reach that blessed place. He was a bright boy, about nine or ten
years old, named Charlie. After listening to her for awhile, he said:
"But you have never been there, Miss D., and how do you know there
really is any such place?"

"Charlie," said the teacher, "you have never been to London; how do
you know there is such a city?"

"O, I know that very well," said Charlie, "because my father is
there; and he has sent me a letter, telling me all about it."

"And God, my Father, is in the heavenly city," said Miss D., "and he
has sent me a letter, telling me about the glory of heaven, and about
the way to get there. The Bible is God's letter."

"Yes, I see," said Charlie, after thinking awhile, "there must be a
heaven, if you have got such a nice long letter from there."

The lesson of hope is the first lesson taught us by the
Transfiguration.

_The next lesson taught us here is_--THE LESSON

OF INSTRUCTION.

The great event of the Transfiguration took place in our Saviour's
life for _this_ reason, among others, that we might learn from it
_how we are to think of Christ_. While the disciples were gazing on
the glory of that scene, and on the distinguished visitors who were
there, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. This cloud, we may
suppose, was like a curtain round Moses and Elias, hiding them from
the view of the disciples. And, as Jesus in his glory was left alone
for them to gaze upon, there came a voice from the overshadowing
cloud, saying--"_This is my beloved Son; in whom I am well
pleased_." This was the voice of God, the Father. It spoke out on
this occasion to teach the disciples then, and you and me now, and
all God's people in every age, what to think about Christ. God, the
Father, tells us here what he thinks about him; and we must learn to
think of him in the same way. His will, his command is that "_all men
should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father_," St. John v: 3.
Moses and Elias were great men in their day. They appeared on this
occasion to add to the honor of Christ. And then they disappeared, as
if to show that they were nothing in comparison with him. He is the
greatest and the best of all beings. He must be first. Prophets and
priests, and kings, and angels even, are as nothing to him. We must
love him--and honor him above all others. The words of the hymn we so
often sing, show us how God would have us think and feel towards him:

  "All hail the power of Jesus' name
    Let angels prostrate fall;
  Bring forth the royal diadem,
    And crown him Lord of all.

  "Let every kindred, every tribe,
    On this terrestrial ball,
  To him all majesty ascribe,
    And crown him Lord of all."

"How Christ Should be Honored." There is a story told of the Emperor
Theodosius the Great which illustrates very well how we should honor
Christ. There were at that time two great parties in the church. One
of these believed and taught the divinity of Christ--or that he is
equal to God the Father. The other party, called Arians, believed and
taught that Christ was not divine; and that he was not to be honored
and worshiped as God. The Emperor Theodosius favored this latter
party. When his son, Arcadius, was about sixteen years old, his
father determined to make him a sharer of his throne, and passed a
law that his son should receive the same respect and honor that were
due to himself. And, in connection with this event, an incident
occurred which led the emperor to see how wrong the view was which he
held respecting the character of Christ, and to give it up. When
Arcadius was proclaimed the partner of his father in the empire, the
officers of the government, and other prominent persons, called on
the emperor in his palace, to congratulate him on the occasion, and
to pay their respects to his son.

Among those who thus came, was a celebrated bishop of the church. He
was very decided in the views he held about the real divinity of
Christ, and very much opposed to all who denied this divinity.

Coming into the presence of the emperor, the bishop paid his respects
to him, in the most polite and proper manner. Then he was about to
retire from the palace, without taking any special notice of the
emperor's son. This made the father angry. He said to the bishop, "Do
you take no notice of my son? Have you not heard that I have made him
a partner with myself in the government of the empire?"

The good old bishop made no reply to this, but going to Arcadius, he
laid his hand on his head, saying, as he did so--"The Lord bless
thee, my son!" and was again turning to retire.

Even this did not satisfy the emperor, who asked, in a tone of
surprise and displeasure, "Is _this_ all the respect you pay to a
prince whom I have made equal in dignity with myself?"

With great warmth the bishop answered--"Does your majesty resent so
highly my apparent neglect of your son, because I do not treat him
with equal honor to yourself? What, then, must the _Eternal God_--the
King of heaven--think of you, who refuse to render to his only
begotten Son, the honor and the worship that he claims for him?"

This had such an effect upon the emperor that he changed his views on
this subject, and ever afterwards took part with those who
acknowledged the divinity of Christ, and honored the Son, even as
they honored the Father.

And so we see that the second lesson taught by the Transfiguration
was the _lesson of instruction_. We must learn to think of Christ as
the Father in heaven thinks of him.

_And then there is_--A LESSON OF DUTY--_that comes to us from this
Transfiguration scene_.

We are taught this lesson by the last two words that were spoken, by
the voice which the apostles heard from the cloud that overshadowed
them. These are the words:--"_Hear Him."_ "This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased: _Hear Him_." This is God's command to every
one of us. To hear Jesus, means to listen attentively to what he has
to say, and to do it. And what does Jesus say to us? He says many
things. But the most important thing he has to say to the young, is
what we find in St. Matt, vi: 33: "_Seek ye_ FIRST _the kingdom of
God_." This means that we must give our hearts to Jesus, and serve
him while we are young. We must do this _first_,--before we do
anything else. We cannot hear or obey Jesus in anything, till we hear
and obey him in this. And there are three good reasons why we should
do this.

We should "hear him" because there is _safety_ in it. We are exposed
to dangers every day, and nothing will so help to keep us safe in the
midst of these dangers as hearing Jesus, and doing what he tells us
to do. Here is an illustration of what I mean.

"Life in the Midst of Danger." There was an alarm of fire one day,
near one of our large public schools. The children in the school were
greatly frightened. They screamed, and left their places, and began
to rush to the windows and stairs. The stairway leading to the door
was soon choked up; and although the fire never reached the
school-house, many of the children had their limbs broken and were
bruised and wounded in other ways.

But there was one little girl who remained quietly in her seat
during all this excitement. When the alarm was over, and the wounded
children had been taken home, and order was restored in the school,
the teacher asked this little girl why she sat still in her seat, and
did not rush towards the door, as the other girls had done.

"My father is a fireman," she said, "and he has always told me that
if ever there was a cry of fire when I was in school, I must remain
quiet in my seat, for that was the safest way. I was dreadfully
frightened; but I knew that what father had told me was best; and so
I sat still, while the others were running to the door." This little
girl _heard_ her father. She minded him. She did what he told her to
do, and she found safety in doing so. And if we "_hear him_" of whom
the voice from the Mount of Transfiguration speaks to us--we shall
find safety from many a danger.

We ought to learn this lesson of duty, and "hear him," because there
is _success_ in it.

In old times, when the racers were running in the public games, if a
man wished to be successful in the race, it was necessary for him to
fix his eye on the prize, at the end of the race-course, and keep it
fixed there till he reached the end. No one could have any success in
racing who did not do this.

Here is an incident about some boys at play that illustrates the
point now before us.

"How to Walk Straight." A light snow had fallen in a certain village,
and some of the village boys met to make the best use they could of
the new fallen snow. It was too dry for snowballing, and was not deep
enough for coasting; so they thought they would improve the occasion
by playing at making tracks in the snow.

There was a large meadow near by, with a grand old oak tree standing
in the centre of it. The boys gathered round the tree, and stood, on
opposite sides, each one with his back against the tree. At a given
signal they were to start, and walk to the fence opposite to each of
them; and then return to the tree, and see which had made the
straightest track.

The signal was given. They started. They reached the fence, and
returned to the tree. "Now, boys, who has made the straightest
track?" said one of the boys, named James Allison.

"Henry Armstrong's is the only one that is straight at all," said
Thomas Sanders.

"I don't see how we all contrived to go so crooked, when the meadow
is so smooth, and there is nothing to turn us out of the way," said
one of the boys.

And then, looking to their successful companion, they said--"Tell us,
Harry, how you managed to make so straight a track?"

Now mark what Harry said:--"I fixed my eye on yonder tall pine tree
on the other side of the fence towards which I was to walk, and never
looked away from it till I reached the fence."

The other boys were walking without any particular aim in view. No
wonder that their walk was crooked. After the apostle Paul became a
Christian, he made one of the straightest tracks through this world
to heaven that ever was made. And he made it in just the same way in
which Harry Armstrong made his straight track through that meadow. We
have seen what Harry said of his track through the snow; now see what
St. Paul says of the way in which he made his straight track through
this world to heaven. "A first ray of the sun, glistening through the branches, pierced
that fog of the dawn, illuminated it with a rosy reflection just
behind the rustic lovers, framing their vague shadows in a silvery
background.

It was well done; yes, indeed, well done.

"I was working on the declivity which led to the Valley of Etretat.
On this particular morning I had, by chance, the sort of floating
vapor which I needed. Suddenly something rose up in front of me like
a phantom; it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me she was about to flee.
But I called after her, saying: 'Come here, come here, mademoiselle.
I have a nice little picture for you.'
"She came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my
sketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless, looking
at it, and suddenly she burst into tears. She wept spasmodically, like
men who have striven hard to restrain their tears, but who can
do so no longer and abandon themselves to grief, though still
resisting. I sprang to my feet, moved at the sight of a sorrow I did
not comprehend, and I took her by the hand with an impulse of brusque
affection, a true French impulse which acts before it reflects.

"She let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them
quiver as if all her nerves were being wrenched.

Then she withdrew her hands abruptly, or, rather, snatched them
away.

"I recognized that tremor, for I had felt it, and I could not be
deceived.

Ah! the love tremor of a woman, whether she be fifteen or fifty years
of age, whether she be of the people or of society, goes so straight
to my heart that I never have any hesitation in understanding it!

"Her whole frail being had trembled, vibrated, been overcome.

I knew it.
She walked away before I had time to say a word, leaving me as surprised
as if I had witnessed a miracle and as troubled as if I had
committed a crime.

"I did not go in to breakfast. I went to take a turn on the edge of
the cliff, feeling that I would just as lief weep as laugh, looking
on the adventure as both comic and deplorable and my position as
ridiculous, believing her unhappy enough to go insane.

"I asked myself what I ought to do. It seemed best for me to leave the
place, and I immediately resolved to do so.

"Somewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time and
entered the farmhouse just when the soup had been served up.

"I sat down at the table as usual. Miss Harriet was there, eating away
solemnly, without speaking to any one, without even lifting her eyes.
Her manner and expression were, however, the same as usual.

"I waited patiently till the meal had been finished, when, turning
toward the landlady, I said: 'Well, Madame Lecacheur, it will not
be long now before I shall have to take my leave of you.'
"The good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in her
drawling voice: 'My dear sir, what is it you say? You are going
to leave us after I have become so accustomed to you?'
"I glanced at Miss Harriet out of the corner of my eye. Her countenance
did not change in the least. But Celeste, the little servant, looked
up at me. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,
fresh, as strong as a horse, and possessing the rare attribute of
cleanliness. I had kissed her at odd times in out-of-the-way corners,
after the manner of travellers--nothing more.

"The dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe
under the apple trees, walking up and down from one end of the
enclosure to the other.
All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange
discovery of the morning, that passionate and grotesque
attachment for me, the recollections which that revelation had
suddenly called up, recollections at once charming and perplexing,
perhaps also that look which the servant had cast on me at the
announcement of my departure--all these things, mixed up and combined,
put me now in a reckless humor, gave me a tickling sensation of
kisses on the lips and in my veins a something which urged me on
to commit some folly.

"Night was coming on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, when I
descried Celeste, who had gone to fasten up the poultry yard at
the other end of the enclosure.

    I darted toward her, running so noiselessly
    that she heard nothing, and as she got up
    from closing the small trapdoor by which the
    chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and
    rained on her coarse, fat face a shower
    of kisses. She struggled,
    laughing all the time, as she was accustomed to
    do in such circumstances. Why did I suddenly
    loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience
    a shock? What was it that I heard behind
    me?

"It was Miss Harriet, who had come upon us, who had seen us and who
stood in front of us motionless as a spectre. Then she disappeared in
the darkness.

"I was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been thus
surprised by her than if she had caught me committing some criminal
act.

"I slept badly that night. I was completely unnerved and haunted by
sad thoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping, but in this I was
no doubt deceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some
one walking up and down in the house and opening the hall
door.

"Toward morning I was overcome by fatigue and fell asleep. I got up
late and did not go downstairs until the late breakfast, being
still in a bewildered state, not knowing what kind of expression
to put on.

"No one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she
did not appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The
English woman had gone out. She must have set out at break of
day, as she was wont to do, in order to see the sun rise.

"Nobody seemed surprised at this, and we began to eat in silence.

"The weather was hot, very hot, one of those broiling, heavy days
when not a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors,
under an apple tree, and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the
cellar to draw a jug of cider, everybody was so thirsty. Celeste
brought the dishes from the kitchen, a ragout of mutton with
potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.
Afterward she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of
the season.

"As I wished to wash and freshen these, I begged the servant
to go and draw me a pitcher of cold water.

"In about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was
dry. She had lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord
and had touched the bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again it
was empty. Mother Lecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for
herself, went and looked down the hole.

She returned, announcing that one could see clearly something in the
well, something altogether unusual. But this no doubt was bundles of
straw, which a neighbor had thrown in out of spite.

"I wished to look down the well also, hoping I might be able to clear
up the mystery, and I perched myself close to the brink. I perceived
indistinctly a white object. What could it be? I then conceived
the idea of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so the
yellow flame danced on the layers of stone and gradually became
clearer. All four of us were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and
Celeste having now joined us. The lantern rested on a black-and-white
indistinct mass, singular, incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:

"'It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have got out of the
meadow during the night and fallen in headlong.'
"But suddenly a cold shiver froze me to the marrow.

I first recognized a foot, then a leg sticking up; the whole body
and the other leg were completely under water.

"I stammered out in a loud voice, trembling so violently that the
lantern danced hither and thither over the slipper:

"'It is a woman! Who-who-can it be? It is Miss Harriet!'
"Sapeur alone did not manifest horror.

He had witnessed many such scenes in Africa.

"Mother Lecacheur and Celeste began to utter piercing screams and ran
away.

"But it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead woman. I
attached the young man securely by the waist to the end of the pulley
rope and lowered him very slowly, watching him disappear in the
darkness. In one hand he held the lantern and a rope in the other.
Soon I recognized his voice, which seemed to come from the centre
of the earth, saying:

"'Stop!'
"I then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other
leg. He then bound the two feet together and shouted anew:

"'Haul up!'
"I began to wind up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,
and I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom.
When his head appeared at the brink I asked:

"'Well?' as if I expected he had a message from the drowned woman.

"We both got on the stone slab at the edge of the well and from
opposite sides we began to haul up the body.

"Mother Lecacheur and Celeste watched us from a distance, concealed
from view behind the wall of the house. When they saw issuing
from the hole the black slippers and white stockings of the drowned
person they disappeared.

"Sapeur seized the ankles, and we drew up the body of the poor woman.

The head was shocking to look at, being bruised and lacerated, and the
long gray hair, out of curl forevermore, hanging down tangled and
disordered.

"'In the name of all that is holy! how lean she is,' exclaimed Sapeur
in a contemptuous tone.

"We carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an
appearance I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the
corpse for burial.

"I washed her disfigured face. Under the touch of my finger an eye was
slightly opened and regarded me with that pale, cold look, that
terrible look of a corpse which seems to come from the beyond.

I braided as well as I could her dishevelled hair and with my clumsy
hands arranged on her head a novel and singular coiffure. Then I took
off her dripping wet garments, baring, not without a feeling of
shame, as though I had been guilty of some profanation, her shoulders
and her chest and her long arms, as slim as the twigs of a tree.

"I next went to fetch some flowers, poppies, bluets, marguerites
and fresh, sweet-smelling grass with which to strew her funeral
couch.

"I then had to go through the usual formalities, as I was alone
to attend to everything. A letter found in her pocket, written at the
last moment, requested that her body be buried in the village in
which she had passed the last days of her life.

A sad suspicion weighed on my heart.

Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in this
place?

"Toward evening all the female gossips of the locality came to view
the remains of the defunct, but I would not allow a single person to
enter. I wanted to be alone, and I watched beside her all
night.

"I looked at the corpse by the flickering light of the candles, at
this unhappy woman, unknown to us all, who had died in such a
lamentable manner and so far away from home. Had she left no friends,
no relations behind her? What had her infancy been? What had been
her life? Whence had she come thither alone, a wanderer, lost like a
dog driven from home?
What secrets of sufferings and of despair were sealed up in that
unprepossessing body, in that poor body whose outward appearance
had driven from her all affection, all love?

"How many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon
that human creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature!

It was all over with her, without her ever having experienced,
perhaps, that which sustains the greatest outcasts to wit,
the hope of being loved once!
Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the
face of others?

Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately,
everything living that was not a man?

"I recognized the fact that she believed in a God, and that she
hoped to receive compensation from the latter for all the miseries
she had endured.

She would now disintegrate and become, in turn, a plant. She would
blossom in the sun, the cattle would browse on her leaves, the
birds would bear away the seeds, and through these changes she
would become again human flesh. But that which is called the soul
had been extinguished at the bottom of the dark well. She suffered no
longer. She had given her life for that of others yet to come.

"Hours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the
dead. A pale light at length announced the dawn of a new day; then a
red ray streamed in on the bed, making a bar of light across the
coverlet and across her hands. This was the hour she had so much
loved. The awakened birds began to sing in the trees.

"I opened the window to its fullest extent and drew back the
curtains that the whole heavens might look in upon us, and, bending
over the icy corpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head and slowly,
without terror or disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those
lips which had never before been kissed."
Leon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box
seat the Count d'Atraille blowing his nose from time to time. The
coachman alone had gone to sleep. The horses, who no longer felt
the sting of the whip, had slackened their pace and moved along
slowly. The drag, hardly advancing at all, seemed suddenly torpid,
as if it had been freighted with sorrow.

[Miss Harriet appeared in Le Gaulois, July 9, 1883, under the title
of Miss Hastings. The story was later revised, enlarged; and partly
reconstructed. This is what De Maupassant wrote to Editor Havard March
15, 1884, in an unedited letter, in regard to the title of the story
that was to give its name to the volume:

"I do not believe that Hastings is a bad name, inasmuch as it is known
all over the world, and recalls the greatest facts in English history.
Besides, Hastings is as much a name as Duval is with us.

"The name Cherbuliez selected, Miss Revel, is no more like an English
name than like a Turkish name. But here is another name as English
as Hastings, and more euphonious; it is Miss Harriet.
I will ask you therefore to substitute Harriet for Hastings."
It was in regard to this very tittle that De Maupassant had a disagreement
with Audran and Boucheron director of the Bouffes Parisiens in
October, 1890 They had given this title to an operetta about to be
played at the Bouffes.

It ended however, by their ceding to De Maupassant, and the title of
the operetta was changed to Miss Helyett.]

LITTLE LOUISE ROQUE

The former soldier, Mederic Rompel, familiarly called Mederic by
the country folks, left the post office of Roily-le-Tors at the usual
hour.
After passing through the village with his long stride, he cut
across the meadows of Villaume and reached the bank of the Brindille,
following the path along the water's edge to the village of Carvelin,
where he commenced to deliver his letters. He walked quickly,
following the course of the narrow river, which frothed, murmured and
boiled in its grassy bed beneath an arch of willows.

Mederic went on without stopping, with only this thought in his mind:
"My first letter is for the Poivron family, then I have one for
Monsieur Renardet; so I must cross the wood."
His blue blouse, fastened round his waist by a black leather belt,
moved in a quick, regular fashion above the green hedge of willow
trees, and his stout stick of holly kept time with his steady
tread.

He crossed the Brindille on a bridge consisting of a tree trunk, with
a handrail of rope, fastened at either end to a stake driven into the
ground.

The wood, which belonged to Monsieur Renardet, the mayor of Carvelin
and the largest landowner in the district, consisted of huge old
trees, straight as pillars and extending for about half a league
along the left bank of the stream which served as a boundary to this
immense dome of foliage. Alongside the water large shrubs had grown
up in the sunlight, but under the trees one found nothing but moss,
thick, soft and yielding, from which arose, in the still air, an
odor of dampness and of dead wood.

Mederic slackened his pace, took off his black cap adorned with red
lace and wiped his forehead, for it was by this time hot in the
meadows, though it was not yet eight o'clock in the morning.

He had just recovered from the effects of the heat and resumed his
quick pace when he noticed at the foot of a tree a knife, a child's
small knife. When he picked it up he discovered a thimble and
also a needlecase not far away.

Having taken up these objects, he thought: "I'll entrust them to
the mayor," and he resumed his journey, but now he kept his eyes open,
expecting to find something else.

All of a sudden he stopped short, as if he had struck against
a wooden barrier. Ten paces in front of him lay stretched on her
back on the moss a little girl, perfectly nude, her face covered with
a handkerchief. She was about twelve years old.

Meredic advanced on tiptoe, as if he apprehended some danger, and
he glanced toward the spot uneasily.

What was this?

No doubt she was asleep. Then he reflected that a person does not
go to sleep naked at half-past seven in the morning under the cool
trees.

So, then, she must be dead, and he must be face to face with a crime.
At this thought a cold shiver ran through his frame, although he
was an old soldier.

And then a murder was such a rare thing in the country, and, above
all, the murder of a child, that he could not believe his eyes. But
she had no wound-nothing save a spot of blood on her leg.
How, then, had she been killed?

He stopped close to her and gazed at her, while he leaned on his
stick.
Certainly he must know her, for he knew all the inhabitants of
the district; but, not being able to get a look at her face, he could
not guess her name. He stooped forward in order to take off the
handkerchief which covered her face, then paused, with outstretched
hand, restrained by an idea that occurred to him.

Had he the right to disarrange anything in the condition of the corpse
before the official investigation? He pictured justice to himself as
a kind of general whom nothing escapes and who attaches as much
importance to a lost button as to the stab of a knife in the
stomach.

Perhaps under this handkerchief evidence could be found to sustain
a charge of murder; in fact, if such proof were there it might lose
its value if touched by an awkward hand.

  Then he raised himself
    with the intention
  of hastening toward the
    mayor's residence, but again another thought held him back.

  If the little girl were
    still alive, by any chance,
  he could not leave
    her lying there in this way.

  He sank on his knees
    very gently, a little
  distance from her, through
    precaution, and extended his hand toward her foot.

  It was icy cold, with
    the terrible coldness
  of death which leaves
    us no longer in doubt.

The letter carrier, as he touched her, felt his heart in his mouth, as
he said himself afterward, and his mouth parched. Rising up abruptly,
he rushed off under the trees toward Monsieur Renardet's house.

He walked on faster than ever, with his stick under his arm, his hands
clenched and his head thrust forward, while his leathern bag, filled
with letters and newspapers, kept flapping at his side.

The mayor's residence was at the end of the wood which served as a
park, and one side of it was washed by the Brindille.

It was a big square house of gray stone, very old, and had stood
many a siege in former days, and at the end of it was a huge tower,
twenty metres high, rising out of the water.

From the top of this fortress one could formerly see all the
surrounding country. It was called the Fox's tower, without any
one knowing exactly why; and from this appellation, no doubt, had
come the name Renardet, borne by the owners of this fief, which had
remained in the same family, it was said, for more than two hundred
years.

For the Renardets formed part of the upper middle class, all but noble,
to be met with so often in the province before the Revolution.

The postman dashed into the kitchen, where the servants were taking
breakfast, and exclaimed:

"Is the mayor up?

I want to speak to him at once."
Mederic was recognized as a man of standing and authority, and they
understood that something serious had happened.

As soon as word was brought to Monsieur Renardet, he ordered the postman
to be sent up to him. Pale and out of breath, with his cap in his
hand, Mederic found the mayor seated at a long table covered with
scattered papers.

He was a large, tall man, heavy and red-faced, strong as an ox, and
was greatly liked in the district, although of an excessively
violent disposition.

Almost forty years old and a widower for the past six months, he
lived on his estate like a country gentleman. His choleric
temperament had often brought him into trouble from which the
magistrates of Roily-le-Tors, like indulgent and prudent friends,
had extricated him.

Had he not one day thrown the conductor of the diligence from the
top of his seat because he came near running over his retriever,
Micmac? Had he not broken the ribs of a gamekeeper who abused him for
having, gun in hand, passed through a neighbor's property? Had he
not even caught by the collar the sub-prefect, who stopped over in
the village during an administrative circuit, called by Monsieur
Renardet an electioneering circuit, for he was opposed to the
government, in accordance with family traditions.

The mayor asked:

"What's the matter now, Mederic?"

"I found a little girl dead in your wood."
Renardet rose to his feet, his face the color of brick.

"What do you say--a little girl?"
"Yes, m'sieu, a little girl, quite naked, on her back, with blood
on her, dead--quite dead!"

The mayor gave vent to an oath:

"By God, I'd make a bet it is little Louise Roque! I have just
learned that she did not go home to her mother last night. Where
did you find her?"
The postman described the spot, gave full details and offered to
conduct the mayor to the place.

But Renardet became brusque:
"No, I don't need you. Send the watchman, the mayor's secretary and
the doctor to me at once, and resume your rounds. Quick, quick, go
and tell them to meet me in the wood."
The letter carrier, a man used to discipline, obeyed and withdrew,
angry and grieved at not being able to be present at the
investigation.
The mayor, in his turn, prepared to go out, took his big soft hat
and paused for a few seconds on the threshold of his abode. In front
of him stretched a wide sward, in which were three large beds of
flowers in full bloom, one facing the house and the others at either
side of it. Farther on the outlying trees of the wood rose skyward,
while at the left, beyond the Brindille, which at that spot widened
into a pond, could be seen long meadows, an entirely green flat
sweep of country, intersected by trenches and hedges of pollard
willows.
To the right, behind the stables, the outhouses and all the buildings
connected with the property, might be seen the village, which was
wealthy, being mainly inhabited by cattle breeders.
Renardet slowly descended the steps in front of his house, and,
turning to the left, gained the water's edge, which he followed at
a slow pace, his hand behind his back. He walked on, with bent head,
and from time to time glanced round in search of the persons he had
sent for.
When he stood beneath the trees he stopped, took off his hat and
wiped his forehead as Mederic had done, for the burning sun was
darting its fiery rays on the earth. Then the mayor resumed his
journey, stopped once more and retraced his steps. Suddenly, stooping
down, he steeped his handkerchief in the stream that glided along
at his feet and spread it over his head, under his hat. Drops of
water flowed down his temples over his ears, which were always
purple, over his strong red neck, and made their way, one after the
other, under his white shirt collar.
As nobody had appeared, he began tapping with his foot, then he
called out:

"Hello! Hello!" 
A voice at his right answered:
"Hello! Hello!"
And the doctor appeared under the trees. He was a thin little man,
an ex-military surgeon, who passed in the neighborhood for a very
skillful practitioner. He limped, having been wounded while in the
service, and had to use a stick to assist him in walking.
Next came the watchman and the mayor's secretary, who, having been
sent for at the same time, arrived together. They looked scared,
and hurried forward, out of breath, walking and running alternately
to hasten their progress, and moving their arms up and down so
vigorously that they seemed to do more work with them than with
their legs.

Renardet said to the doctor:
"You know what the trouble is about?"
"Yes, a child found dead in the wood by Mederic."
"That's quite correct. Come on!""Count your fingers, my boy," said the master.

Dennis looked down on his big, strong hands. "Count thumbs and all,"
added the master.

"I have; there are ten," said the lad.

"Then never say you have not ten good friends, able to help you on in
life. Try what those true friends can do, before you go grumbling and
fretting because you have none to help you."

Now, suppose that we put the word talents, for the word friends, in
this little story. Then, we may each of us hold our two hands before
us, and say "here are ten talents, which God has given me to use for
him. Let me try and do all the good I can with these ten talents."

THE BEST THAT I CAN.

  "'I cannot do much,' said a little star,
    'To make the dark world bright;
  My silvery beams can not struggle far
    Through the folding gloom of night;
  But I'm only a part of God's great plan,
  And I'll cheerfully do the best I can.'

  "A child went merrily forth to play,
    But a thought, like a silver thread,
  Kept winding in and out, all day,
    Through the happy golden head.
  Mother said,--'Darling, do all you can;
  For you are a part of God's great plan.'

  "So he helped a younger child along,
    When the road was rough to the feet,
  And she sung from her heart a little song
    That we all thought passing sweet;
  And her father, a weary, toil-worn man,
  Said, 'I, too, will do the best I can.'"

"A Noble Boy." "Not long ago," said a Christian lady, "I saw a boy do
something that made me glad for a week. Indeed it fills my heart with
tenderness and good feeling whenever I think about it. But let me
tell you what it was.

"As I was walking along a crowded street I saw an old blind man
walking on without any one to lead him. He went very slowly, feeling
his way with his cane.

"'He's walking straight to the highest part of the curb-stone,' said
I to myself. 'And it's very high too. I wonder if some one won't help
him and start him in the right direction.'

"Just then, a boy, about fourteen years old, who was playing near by,
ran up to the old man and gently putting his hand through the man's
arm, said:--'Allow me, my friend, to lead you across the street.' By
this time there were three or four others watching the boy. He not
only helped the old man over one crossing, but led him over another
to the lower side of the street. Then he ran back to his play.

"Now this boy thought he had only done an act of kindness to that old
man. But just see how much farther than that the use of his one
talent went. The three boys with whom he was playing, and who had
watched his kind act, were happier and better for it, and felt that
they must be more careful to do little kindnesses to those about
them.

"The three or four persons who stopped to watch the boy turned away
with a tender smile upon their faces, ready to follow the good
example of that noble boy. I am sure that I felt more gentle and
loving towards every one, from what I saw that boy do.

"And then, another one that was made happy was the boy himself. For,
it is impossible for us to do a kind act, or to make any one else
happy, without feeling better and happier ourselves. To _be_ good and
to _do_ good, is the way to be happy. This is our mission here in
this world. Whatever talents our Master has given us, he intends that
we should use them in this way."

"Tiny's Work for God." Two little girls, Leila and Tiny, were
sitting, one summer day, under the tree which grew beside their home.

Both children had been quiet for a little while, when suddenly Tiny
raised her blue eyes and said, "I _am_ so happy, Leila. I do love the
flowers, and the birdies, and you, and everybody so much." Then she
added, in a whisper, "And I love God, who made us all so happy.
Sister, I wish I could do something for him."

"Mother says if we love him, that is what he likes best of all," said
Leila.

"Yes, but I do want to _do_ something for him--something that would
give me trouble. Can't you think of anything?"

Leila thought a little, and said, "Perhaps you could print a text
for the flowers mother sends every week to the sick people in the
hospital. They are so glad to have the flowers, and then the text
might help them think about our Father in heaven."

"Oh! thank you, sister, that will be so nice! I will write--'Suffer
the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.'"

But Tiny was only a little over four years old, and it was hard for
her to hold a pen, but she managed to print two letters every day
till the text was finished. Then she went alone to her room, and
laying the text on a chair, she kneeled down beside it, and
said--"Heavenly Father, I have done this for you: please take it from
Tiny, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen." And God heard the prayer, for
he always listens when children truly pray.

So Tiny's text was sent up to London, and a lady put a very pretty
flower into the card and took it to the hospital. She stopped beside
a bed where a little boy was lying. His face was almost as white as
the pillow on which he lay, and his dark eyes were filled with tears.

"Is the pain very bad to-day, Willie?"

"Yes, miss; its dreadful-like. But it's not so much the pain as I
mind. I'm used to that, yer know. Father beat me every day a'most,
when he was drunk. But the doctor says I'm too ill for 'im to 'ave
any 'opes for me, and I'm mighty afeard to die."

"If you had a friend who loved you, and you were well, would you be
afraid to go and stay with him, Willie?"

"Why no, I'd like to go, in course."

"I have brought you a message from a Friend, who has loved you all
your life long. He wants you to trust him, and to go and live with
him. He will love you always, and you will always be happy."

Then the lady read Tiny's text, "_Suffer the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not._" She told him how Jesus had died, and
then had risen again, and had gone to heaven, to prepare a place for
_him_, and for many other children. She told him how Jesus is still
saying "Come," and his hand is still held out to bless.

So Willie turned to the Good Shepherd, and was no longer afraid. A
few days afterwards he whispered--"Lord Jesus, I am coming;" and he
died with Tiny's text in his hand.

That little girl used the talent that was given her, and it helped
to bring a soul to Jesus.

EVERY TALENT USEFUL.

    "Though little I bring,
    Said the tiny spring,
    As it burst from the mighty hill,
    'Tis pleasant to know,
    Wherever I flow,
    The pastures are greener still.

    "And the drops of rain
    As they fall on the plain,
    When parched by the summer heat,
    Refresh the sweet flowers
    Which droop in the bowers,
    And hang down their heads at our feet.

    "May we strive to fulfill
    All His righteous will,
    Who formed the whole earth by His word!
    Creator Divine!
    We would ever be Thine,
    And serve Thee--our God, and our Lord!"

Let us never forget this third lesson from Olivet, the lesson
about,--the talents.

_The fourth, and last lesson from Olivet is the lesson about_--THE
REWARDS.

The parable tells us that when the Master came back, and reckoned
with his servants, he said to each of those who had made a right use
of his talents:--"Well done, good and faithful servant, thou hast
been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord." In the parable in St.
Luke we are told that the servant who had gained ten pounds was made
ruler over ten cities; and he who had gained five pounds was made
ruler over five cities. This shows us that God will reward his
people, hereafter, according to the degree of faithfulness with which
each one shall have used the talents given to him. And this is the
lesson which the apostle Paul teaches us when he says that, "Every
man shall receive _his own reward_ according to _his own labor."_ I.
Cor. iii: 8.

All the willing, loving servants of God will receive a crown of life
when Jesus comes to reckon with them. But those crowns will not be
all alike. They are spoken of as "crowns of gold:" Rev. iv: 4; as
"crowns of glory:" I. Peter v: 4, and as "crowns of life:" Rev. iii:
11. But still there will be very great differences between these
crowns. Some will be simply crowns of gold, or of glory, without any
gems or jewels to ornament them. Some will have two or three small
jewels shining in them. But, others again will be full of the most
beautiful jewels, all glittering and sparkling with glory. And this
will all depend upon the way in which those who wear these crowns
used their talents while they were on earth, and the amount of work
they did for Jesus. There is an incident mentioned in Roman history
about a soldier, which illustrates this part of our subject very
well.

"The Faithful Soldier and His Rewards." This man had served forty
years in the cause of his country--of these, ten years had been spent
as a private soldier, and thirty as an officer. He had been present
in one hundred and twenty battles, and had been severely wounded
forty-five times. He had received fourteen civic crowns, for having
saved the lives of so many Roman citizens; three mural crowns, for
having been the first to mount the breach when attacking a fortress;
and eight golden crowns, for having, on so many occasions, rescued
the standard of a Roman legion from the hands of the enemy. He had in
his house eighty-three gold chains, sixty bracelets, eighteen golden
spears, and twenty-three horse trappings,--the rewards for his many
faithful services as a soldier. And when his friends looked at all
those honors and treasures which he had received, from time to time,
how well they might have said as they pointed to those numerous
prizes--that he had "received _his own reward_, according to _his own
labor_," and faithfulness! And so it will be with the soldiers of the
cross, who are faithful in using the talents given them by their
heavenly Master.

"A Great Harvest from a Little Seed," Some years ago there was a
celebrated artist in Paris whose name was Ary Scheffer. On one
occasion he wished to introduce a beggar into a certain picture he
was painting. Baron Rothschild, the famous banker, and one of the
richest men in the world, was a particular friend of this artist. He
happened to come into his studio at the very time he was trying to
get a beggar to be the model of one which he desired to put into his
painting.

"Wait till to-morrow," said Mr. Rothschild, "and I will dress myself
up as a beggar, and make you an excellent model."

"Very well," said the artist, who was pleased with the strangeness of
the proposal. The next day the rich banker appeared, dressed up as a
beggar, and a very sorry looking beggar he was. While the artist was
engaged in painting him, another friend of his came into the studio.
He was a kind-hearted, generous man. As he looked on the model
beggar, he was touched by his wretched appearance, and as he passed
him, he slipped a louis d'or--a French gold coin, worth about five
dollars of our money--into his hand. The pretended beggar took the
coin, and put it in his pocket.

Ten years after this, the gentleman who gave this piece of money
received an order on the bank of the Rothschilds for ten thousand
francs. This was enclosed in a letter which read as follows:

"Sir: You one day gave a louis d'or to Baron Rothschild, in the
studio of Ary Scheffer. He has invested it, and made good use of it,
and to-day he sends you the capital you entrusted to him, together
with the interest it has gained. A good action is always followed by
a good reward.

"JAMES DE ROTHSCHILD."

In those few years that one gold coin, of twenty francs, had
increased to ten thousand francs. And this illustrates the way in
which Jesus the heavenly Master rewards those who use their talents
for him. See how he teaches this lesson, when he says--"Whosoever
shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold
water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall
in _no wise lose his reward_." St. Matt, x: 42. And in another place
we are told that the reward shall be "an hundred fold," and shall run
on into "everlasting life." St. Matt, xix: 29. How sweetly some one
has thus written about

THE REWARD OF HEAVEN.

    "Light after darkness, gain after loss,
    Strength after weariness, crown after cross;
    Sweet after bitter, song after sigh,
    Home after wandering, praise after cry;
    Sheaves after sowing, sun after rain,
    Light after mystery, peace after pain;
    Joy after sorrow, calm after blast,
    Rest after weariness, sweet rest at last;
    Near after distant, gleam after gloom,
    Love after loneliness, life after tomb.
    After long agony, rapture of bliss,
    Christ is the pathway leading to this!"

The last lesson from Olivet is the lesson about the rewards. And
taking these lessons together, let us remember that they are--the
lesson _about the Master_: the lesson _about the servants_: the
lesson _about the talents_: and the lesson _about the rewards_.

The Collect for the thirteenth Sunday after Trinity is a very
suitable prayer to offer after meditating on the lessons from Olivet:

"Almighty and merciful God, of whose only gift it cometh that thy
faithful people do unto thee true and laudable service: Grant, we
beseech thee, that we may so faithfully serve thee in this life, that
we fail not finally to attain thy heavenly promises; which exceed all
that we can desire; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord.
AMEN!"


THE LORD'S SUPPER


We are approaching now the end of our Saviour's life. The last week
has come, and we are in the midst of it. This is called Passion week.
We commonly use this word _passion_ to denote anger. But the first
and true meaning of the word, and of the Latin word from which it
comes, is--suffering. And this is the sense in which we find the word
used in Acts i: 3. There, St. Luke, who wrote the Acts, is speaking
of Christ's appearing to the apostles, after his resurrection, and he
uses this language: "To whom he showed himself alive, after his
_passion_;" or after his suffering and death.

In the midst of this last week--this passion week--one of the
interesting things that Jesus did was to keep the Jewish Passover for
the last time with his disciples. This Passover feast had been kept
by the Jews every year for nearly fifteen hundred years. It was the
most solemn religious service they had. It was first observed by
them in the night on which their nation was delivered from the
bondage of Egypt and began their march towards the promised land of
Canaan. We read about the establishment of this solemn service in
Exodus, twelfth chapter. The first Passover took place on the
fourteenth day of the month Nisan. This had been the seventh month of
the year with the Jews. But God directed them to take it for their
first month ever afterwards. They were to begin their year with that
month. Every family was to choose out a lamb for themselves, on the
tenth day of the month. They were to keep it to the fourteenth day of
the month. On the evening of that day, they were to kill the lamb.
The blood of the lamb was to be sprinkled on the two side-posts and
upper lintels of every door. They were to roast the lamb and eat it,
with solemn religious services. And, while they were doing this, the
angel of the Lord was to pass over all the land of Egypt, and, with
his unseen sword, to smite and kill the first-born, or eldest child,
in every family, from Pharaoh on his throne to the poorest beggar in
the land. But the blood, sprinkled on the door-posts of the houses in
which the Israelites dwelt, was to save them from the stroke of the
angel of death as he passed over the land. And so it came to pass.
The solemn hour of midnight arrived. The angel went on his way. He
gave one stroke with his dreadful sword--and there was a death in
every Egyptian family. But in the blood-sprinkled dwellings of the
Israelites, there was no one dead. What a wonderful night that was!
Nothing like it was ever known in the history of our world. It is not
surprising that the children of Israel, through all their
generations, should have kept that Passover feast with great
interest--an interest that never died out, from age to age. Nor do we
wonder that our blessed Saviour looked forward longingly to the
occasion when, for the last time, he was to celebrate this Passover
with his disciples. As they began the feast he said to them, "With
desire I have desired" that is, I have earnestly, or heartily desired
"to eat this passover with you before I suffer," St. Luke xxii: 15.
It is easy to think of many reasons why Jesus should have felt this
strong desire. Without attempting to tell what all those reasons
were, we can readily think of some things which would lead him, very
naturally, to have this feeling. It was the last time he was to eat
this Passover with them on earth. This showed that his public work,
for which he came into the world, was done. He had only now to suffer
and die; to rise from the dead, and then go home to his Father in
heaven.

This Passover had been one of the services established and kept for
the purpose of pointing the attention of men to himself as the Lamb
of God who was to take away the sins of the world. And now, the time
had come when all that had thus been pointed out concerning him, for
so many hundred years, was about to be fulfilled. He, the one true
Lamb of God, had come. He was about to die for the sins of the world.
Then the Jewish church would pass away, and the Christian church
would take its place. And then the blessings of true religion,
instead of being confined to one single nation, would be freely
offered to all nations; and Jews and Gentiles alike, would be at
liberty to come to Christ, and to receive from him pardon, and grace,
and salvation, and every blessing.

There was enough in thoughts like these to make Jesus long to eat
this last Passover with his disciples. In each of the four gospels we
have an account of what took place when the time came for keeping
this Passover. What is said concerning it we find in the following
places: St. Matt xxi: 17-30, St. Mark xiv: 12-26, St. Luke xxii:
7-39. St. John begins with the thirteenth chapter, and ends his
account at the close of the seventeenth chapter. He is the only one
of the four evangelists who gives a full and particular account of
the wonderful sayings of our Lord in connection with this last
passover, and of the great prayer that he offered for all his
people.

Here is a brief outline of these different accounts. When the time
came to keep the Passover, Jesus sent two of his disciples from
Bethany, where he was then staying, to Jerusalem. He told them, that,
when they entered the city, they would meet a man bearing a pitcher
of water. They were to ask him to show them the guest-chamber, where
he and his disciples might eat the Passover together. There were
always great crowds of strangers in Jerusalem at the time of this
festival; and many furnished chambers were kept ready to be hired to
those who wished them, for celebrating the Passover. This man, of
whom our Saviour spoke, was probably a friend of his, and according
to our Lord's word, he showed the disciples such a room as they
needed. Then they made the necessary preparations; and, when the
evening came, Jesus and his disciples met there to keep this solemn
feast.

Many of the pictures that we see of this last Supper, represent the
company as seated round a table, very much in the way in which we are
accustomed to sit ourselves. But this is not correct. The people in
those Eastern countries were not accustomed to sit as we do. On this
occasion the roasted lamb, with the bread and wine to be used at the
feast, was placed on a table, and the guests reclined on couches
round the table, each man leaning on his left arm, and helping
himself to what he needed with his right hand.

Various incidents took place in connection with this last Supper. The
disciples had a contest among themselves about which of them should
be greatest. This led Jesus, in the course of the evening, to give
them the lesson of humility, by washing his disciples' feet, of which
we have already spoken. Then he told them how sorrowfully he was
feeling. He said they would all forsake him, and one of them would
betray him that very night. This made them feel very sad. Each of
them suspected himself--and asked sorrowfully--"Lord, is it I?" They
did not suspect each other; and none of them seems to have suspected
Judas Iscariot at all. Then Peter whispered to John, who was leaning
on the bosom of Jesus, to ask who it was that was to do this? In
answer to John's question, Jesus said it was the one to whom he
should give a piece of bread when he had dipped it in the dish. Then
he dipped the sop and gave it to Judas.

After this, we are told that Satan entered into him, and he went out
and made preparation for doing the most dreadful thing that ever was
done from the beginning of the world--and that was the betrayal of
his great, and good, and holy Master, into the hands of his enemies.
When Judas was gone, and before the Passover feast was finished,
making use of some of the materials before him, Jesus established one
of the two great sacraments to be observed in his church to the end
of the world--the sacrament of the Lord's Supper--or the holy
Communion.

This is St. Luke's account of the way in which it was done, chapter
xxii: 19, 20--"And he took the bread, and gave thanks, and brake it,
and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:
this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper,
saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for
you." St. Matthew adds, and--"for many."

Such is the account we have of the first establishment of the Lord's
Supper. It was to take the place of the Jewish Passover, and to be
observed by the followers of Christ all over the earth, until the
time when he shall come again into our world.

And this solemn sacrament--this holy communion--this Supper of our
Lord, ought to be observed, or kept, by all who love him, for three
reasons: these are its connection with _the word of his command--the
memory of his sufferings--and the hope of his glory_.

Jesus connected this sacrament with _the word of his command_ when he
said--"_This do_ in remembrance of me." St. Luke xxii: 19. This is
the _command_ of Christ. It is a plain, positive command. Jesus did
not give this command to the apostles only, or to his ministers, or
to any particular class of his followers, but to all of them. It was
given first to his apostles, but it was not intended to be confined
to them. Jesus does not say--"This do," ye who are my apostles; or,
ye who are my ministers. He does not say--"This do," ye old men, or
ye rich men, or ye great men; but simply, "This do." And the meaning
of what he here says, is--"This do," all ye who profess to be my
followers, all over the world, and through all ages. And the words
that he spake on another occasion come in very well here: "If ye love
me, keep my commandments." And _this_ is one of the commandments that
he expects all his people to keep. He points to his holy sacrament,
which he has ordained in his church, and then to each one of his
people he says--"This do." No matter whether we wish to do it or not;
here are our master's words--"This do." No matter whether we see the
use of it, or not; Jesus says--"This do." It is enough for each
follower of Jesus to say, "here is my Lord's command; I _must_ obey
it."

In an army, if the general issues an order, it is expected that every
soldier will obey it. And no matter how important, or useful, in
itself considered, any work may be, that is done by one of those
soldiers, yet, if it be done while he is neglecting the general's
order, instead of gaining for that soldier the praise of the general,
or of securing a reward from him, it will only excite his
displeasure:--he will order that soldier to be punished.

But the church of Christ is compared in the Bible to an army. He is
the Captain or Leader of this army. And one of the most important
orders he has issued for his soldiers is--"This do in remembrance of
me." If we profess to be the soldiers of Christ, and are enlisted in
his army, and yet are neglecting this order, he never can be pleased
with anything we may do while this order is neglected. We seem to see
him pointing to this neglected order, and saying to each of us, as he
said to Saul, the first king of Israel, by the prophet Samuel:
--"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice: and to hearken, than the
fat of rams." I. Sam. xv: 22.

No age is fixed in the New Testament at which young people may be
allowed to come to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. But, as soon
as they have learned to know and love Christ and are really trying to
serve him, they ought to be allowed to come. And yet ministers and
parents sometimes keep them back, and tell them they must wait, and
be tried a little longer, before they receive the help and comfort of
this ordinance of Christ, even when their conduct shows they are
sincerely trying to love and serve the blessed Saviour.

If a farmer should send his servant out into the field, when winter
was approaching, telling him to put the sheep into the fold, that
they might be protected from the wolves, and from the cold, it would
be thought a strange thing if he should allow him to bring the sheep
into the shelter of the fold, and leave the little lambs outside.
This is a good illustration to show the importance of taking care of
the lambs. But it fails at one point. The shelter of the fold is
absolutely necessary for the protection of the farmer's lambs. They
could not live without it. If left outside of the fold they would
certainly perish. But there is not the same necessity for admitting
young people to the Lord's Supper. They are not left out in the cold,
like the lambs in the field, even when not admitted to this holy
ordinance. They are already under the care and protection of the good
Shepherd. He can guard them, and keep them, and cause them to grow in
grace, even though, for awhile, they do not have the help and comfort
of this sacrament. And, if they are kept back through the fault or
mistake of others, he will do so. This sacrament, like that of
baptism, is, as the catechism says, "_generally_ necessary to
salvation." This means that it is important "where it may be had."
But, if circumstances beyond our control should prevent us from
partaking of it, we may be saved without it. Still, I think that
young people who give satisfactory evidence that they know and love
the Saviour, and are trying to serve him, ought to be allowed to come
forward to this holy sacrament.

Some people when urged to come to the Lord's Supper excuse
themselves, by saying that--"they are not prepared to come."

But this will not release any one from the command of Christ--"This
do."

What the preparation is that we need in order that we may come, in a
proper way, to this holy sacrament, is clearly pointed out in the
exhortation that occurs in the communion service of our church. Here
the minister says--"Ye who do truly and earnestly repent of your
sins, and are in love and charity with your neighbors, and intend to
lead a new life, following the commandments of God, and walking from
henceforth in his holy ways: draw near with faith, and take this holy
sacrament to your comfort." And there is no excuse for persons not
being in the state these words describe: for this is just what God's
word, and our own duty and interest require of us. If we have not
yet done what these words require, we ought to do it at once; and
then there will be nothing in the way of our obeying the command of
Christ, when he says--"This do, in remembrance of me," By all the
authority which belongs to him our Saviour _commands_ us to keep this
holy feast. And the first reason why we ought to "do this," is
because of its connection with the word of his command.

_The second reason why we ought to "do this"--is because of its
connection with the memory of his sufferings_.

We are taught this by the word _remembrance_, which our Saviour here
uses. He says, "This do in remembrance of me." This means in
remembrance of my sufferings for you. And _this_ is the most
important word used by him when he established this sacrament. It is
the governing word in the whole service. It is the word by which we
must be guided in trying to understand what our Lord meant to teach
us by all he did and said on this occasion.

You know how it is when we are trying to understand the music to
which a particular tune has been set. There is always one special
note in a tune, which is called the _key-note_. The leader of a
choir, when they are going to sing, will strike one of the keys of
the organ, or the melodeon they are using, so as to give to each
member of the choir the proper key-note of the piece of music they
are to sing. It is very important for them to have this key-note,
because they cannot have a proper understanding of what they are to
do without it. This holy sacrament of the Lord's Supper is like a
solemn song. And the key-note of the music to which the song is set
is this word--_remembrance_. It teaches us that the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper is a _memorial_ service. And, in going through the
music to which the song of this service has been set, every note that
we use must be a memorial note. And the language used by our blessed
Lord when he established this Supper, or sacrament, must be explained
in this way. When he broke the bread and gave it to his disciples,
saying--"This is my body, which is given for you: this do in
remembrance of me," he meant that we should understand him as
saying--"This is the _memorial_ of my body." And when he gave them
the cup, and said--"This is my blood of the New Testament," he meant
that we should understand him as saying--"This is the _memorial_ of
my blood." But the beech tree, having deviated a little, only
rubbed against his loins, throwing him on his face, five metres
away.

The workmen dashed forward to lift him up. He had already arisen
to his knees, stupefied, with bewildered eyes and passing his hand
across his forehead, as if he were awaking from an attack of
madness.

When he had got to his feet once more the men, astonished, questioned
him, not being able to understand what he had done. He replied in
faltering tones that he had been dazed for a moment, or, rather, he
had been thinking of his childhood days; that he thought he would
have time to run under the tree, just as street boys rush in front
of vehicles driving rapidly past; that he had played at danger;
that for the past eight days he felt this desire growing stronger
within him, asking himself each time a tree began to fall whether
he could pass beneath it without being touched.

It was a piece of stupidity, he confessed, but every one has these
moments of insanity and these temptations to boyish folly.

He made this explanation in a slow tone, searching for his words, and
speaking in a colorless tone.

Then he went off, saying:

"Till to-morrow, my friends-till to-morrow."
As soon as he got back to his room he sat down at his table which his
lamp lighted up brightly, and, burying his head in his hands, he
began to cry.

He remained thus for a long time, then wiped his eyes, raised his
head and looked at the clock. It was not yet six o'clock.

He thought:

"I have time before dinner."
And he went to the door and locked it. He then came back, and, sitting
down at his table, pulled out the middle drawer. Taking from it a
revolver, he laid it down on his papers in full view. The barrel of
the firearm glittered, giving out gleams of light.

Renardet gazed at it for some time with the uneasy glance of a drunken
man. Then he rose and began to pace up and down the room.

He walked from one end of the apartment to the other, stopping from
time to time, only to pace up and down again a moment afterward.
Suddenly he opened the door of his dressing-room, steeped a towel
in the water pitcher and moistened his forehead, as he had done
on the morning of the crime.

Then he, began walking up and down again. Each time he passed
the table the gleaming revolver attracted his glance, tempted his
hand, but he kept watching the clock and reflected:

"I have still time."
It struck half-past six. Then he took up the revolver, opened his mouth
wide with a frightful grimace and stuck the barrel into it as if
he wanted to swallow it.

  He remained in this position for
    some seconds without
  moving, his finger on the trigger. Then,
    suddenly seized with a shudder of horror, he dropped the pistol
on the carpet.

He fell back on his armchair, sobbing:

"I cannot. I dare not! My God! my God! How can I have the courage to
kill myself?'"
There was a knock at the door. He rose up, bewildered. A servant
said:

"Monsieur's dinner is ready."
He replied:

"All right. I'm coming down."
Then he picked up the revolver, locked it up again in the drawer and
looked at himself in the mirror over the mantelpiece to see whether
his face did not look too much troubled.

It was as red as usual, a little redder perhaps. That was all.
He went down and seated himself at table.

He ate slowly, like a man who wants to prolong the meal, who
does not want to be alone.

Then he smoked several pipes in the hall while the table was
being cleared. After that he went back to his room.

As soon as he had locked himself in he looked, under the bed, opened
all the closets, explored every corner, rummaged through all the
furniture.
Then he lighted the candles on the mantelpiece, and, turning round
several times, ran his eye all over the apartment with an anguish of
terror that distorted his face, for he knew well that he would see
her, as he did every night--little Louise Roque, the little girl
he had attacked and afterward strangled.

Every night the odious vision came back again. First he seemed to
hear a kind of roaring sound, such as is made by a threshing machine
or the distant passage of a train over a bridge. Then he commenced
to gasp, to suffocate, and he had to unbutton his collar and his
belt.

He moved about to make his blood circulate, he tried to read, he
attempted to sing. It was in vain. His thoughts, in spite of
himself, went back to the day of the murder and made him begin it all
over again in all its most secret details, with all the violent
emotions he had experienced from the first minute to the last.

He had felt on rising that morning, the morning of the horrible day, a
little dizziness and headache, which he attributed to the heat, so
that he remained in his room until breakfast time.

After the meal he had taken a siesta, then, toward the close of the
afternoon, he had gone out to breathe the fresh, soothing breeze under
the trees in the wood.

But, as soon as he was outside, the heavy, scorching air of the plain
oppressed him still more. The sun, still high in the heavens, poured
down on the parched soil waves of burning light. Not a breath
of wind stirred the leaves. Every beast and bird, even the grasshoppers,
were silent.
Renardet reached the tall trees and began to walk over the moss
where the Brindille produced a slight freshness of the air beneath the
immense roof of branches. But he felt ill at ease.

It seemed to him that an unknown, invisible hand was strangling him,
and he scarcely thought of anything, having usually few ideas in
his head.

For the last three months only one thought haunted him, the thought
of marrying again. He suffered from living alone, suffered from
it morally and physically. Accustomed for ten years past to feeling
a woman near him, habituated to her presence every moment, he had
need, an imperious and perplexing need of such association. Since
Madame Renardet's death he had suffered continually without knowing
why, he had suffered at not feeling her dress brushing past him,
and, above all, from no longer being able to calm and rest himself
in her arms. He had been scarcely six months a widower and he was
already looking about in the district for some young girl or some
widow he might marry when his period of mourning was at an end.

He had a chaste soul, but it was lodged in a powerful, herculean
body, and carnal imaginings began to disturb his sleep and his vigils.
He drove them away; they came back again; and he murmured from
time to time, smiling at himself:

"Here I am, like St.

Anthony."
Having this special morning had several of these visions, the desire
suddenly came into his breast to bathe in the Brindille in order
to refresh himself and cool his blood.

He knew of a large deep pool, a little farther down, where the
people of the neighborhood came sometimes to take a dip in summer.
He went there.

Thick willow trees hid this clear body of water where the current
rested and went to sleep for a while before starting on its way again.
Renardet, as he appeared, thought he heard a light sound, a faint
plashing which was not that of the stream on the banks. He softly put
aside the leaves and looked. A little girl, quite naked in the
transparent water, was beating the water with both hands, dancing
about in it and dipping herself with pretty movements.

She was not a child nor was she yet a woman. She was plump and developed,
while preserving an air of youthful precocity, as of one who had
grown rapidly. He no longer moved, overcome with surprise, with desire,
holding his breath with a strange, poignant emotion. He remained there,
his heart beating as if one of his sensuous dreams had just been
realized, as if an impure fairy had conjured up before him this young
creature, this little rustic Venus, rising from the eddies of the
stream as the real Venus rose from the waves of the sea.

Suddenly the little girl came out of the water, and, without seeing
him, came over to where he stood, looking for her clothes in order
to dress herself.

As she approached gingerly, on account of the sharp-pointed stones,
he felt himself pushed toward her by an irresistible force, by a bestial
transport of passion, which stirred his flesh, bewildered his mind
and made him tremble from head to foot.

She remained standing some seconds behind the willow tree which
concealed him from view. Then, losing his reason entirely, he
pushed aside the branches, rushed on her and seized her in his arms.

She fell, too terrified to offer any resistance, too terror-stricken
to cry out. He seemed possessed, not understanding what he was
doing.

He woke from his crime as one wakes from a nightmare. The child burst
out weeping.

    
    "Hold your tongue!
    Hold your tongue!" he said. "I'll
    give you money."
    But she did not hear him and
    went on sobbing.
    
    "Come now, hold your tongue!

    Do hold your tongue! Keep
    quiet!" he continued.
    
    She kept shrieking as
    she tried to free herself. He suddenly
    realized that he was
    ruined, and he caught her by
    the neck to stop her mouth from uttering these heartrending,
dreadful screams.

As she continued to struggle with the desperate strength of a being
who is seeking to fly from death, he pressed his enormous hands on the
little throat swollen with screaming, and in a few seconds he had
strangled her, so furiously did he grip her.

He had not intended to kill her, but only to make her keep quiet.

Then he stood up, overwhelmed with horror.

She lay before him, her face bleeding and blackned. He was about
to rush away when there sprang up in his agitated soul the mysterious
and undefined instinct that guides all beings in the hour of danger.

He was going to throw the body into the water, but another impulse
drove him toward the clothes, which he made into a small package.

Then, as he had a piece of twine in his pocket, he tied it up and
hid it in a deep portion of the stream, beneath the trunk of a tree
that overhung the Brindille.

Then he went off at a rapid pace, reached the meadows, took a wide
turn in order to show himself to some peasants who dwelt some
distance away at the opposite side of the district, and came back
to dine at the usual hour, telling his servants all that was
supposed to have happened during his walk.

He slept, however, that night; he slept with a heavy, brutish sleep
like the sleep of certain persons condemned to death. He did not open
his eyes until the first glimmer of dawn, and he waited till his
usual hour for riding, so as to excite no suspicion.

Then he had to be present at the inquiry as to the cause of death.
He did so like a somnambulist, in a kind of vision which showed him
men and things as in a dream, in a cloud of intoxication, with that
sense of unreality which perplexes the mind at the time of the greatest
catastrophes.

But the agonized cry of Mother Roque pierced his heart. At that moment
he had felt inclined to cast himself at the old woman's feet and
to exclaim:

"I am the guilty one!"
But he had restrained himself. He went back, however, during the
night to fish up the dead girl's wooden shoes, in order to place
them on her mother's threshold.

As long as the inquiry lasted, as long as it was necessary to lead
justice astray he was calm, master of himself, crafty and
smiling.

He discussed quietly with the magistrates all the suppositions
that passed through their minds, combated their opinions and demolished
their arguments. He even took a keen and mournful pleasure in
disturbing their investigations, in embroiling their ideas, in showing
the innocence of those whom they suspected.

But as soon as the inquiry was abandoned he became gradually nervous,
more excitable than he had been before, although he mastered his
irritability.

Sudden noises made him start with fear; he shuddered at the slightest
thing and trembled sometimes from head to foot when a fly alighted on
his forehead. Then he was seized with an imperious desire for
motion, which impelled him to take long walks and to remain up whole
nights pacing up and down his room.

It was not that he was goaded by remorse. His brutal nature did not
lend itself to any shade of sentiment or of moral terror.

A man of energy and even of violence, born to make war, to ravage
conquered countries and to massacre the vanquished, full
of the savage instincts of the hunter and the fighter, he scarcely
took count of human life. Though he respected the Church outwardly,
from policy, he believed neither in God nor the devil, expecting
neither chastisement nor recompense for his acts in another life. His
sole belief was a vague philosophy drawn from all the ideas of the
encyclopedists of the last century, and he regarded religion as a moral
sanction of the law, the one and the other having been invented
by men to regulate social relations.

To kill any one in a duel, or in war, or in a quarrel, or by
accident, or for the sake of revenge, or even through bravado
would have seemed to him an amusing and clever thing and would not
have left more impression on his mind than a shot fired at a
hare; but he had experienced a profound emotion at the murder of
this child. He had, in the first place, perpetrated it in the heat
of an irresistible gust of passion, in a sort of tempest of the
senses that had overpowered his reason. And he had cherished in
his heart, in his flesh, on his lips, even to the very tips of his
murderous fingers a kind of bestial love, as well as a feeling of
terrified horror, toward this little girl surprised by him and
basely killed. Every moment his thoughts returned to that horrible
scene, and, though he endeavored to drive this picture from his
mind, though he put it aside with terror, with disgust, he felt it
surging through his soul, moving about in him, waiting incessantly
for the moment to reappear.
Then, as evening approached, he was afraid of the shadow falling
around him. He did not yet know why the darkness seemed frightful
to him, but he instinctively feared it, he felt that it was peopled
with terrors. The bright daylight did not lend itself to fears.
Things and beings were visible then, and only natural things and
beings could exhibit themselves in the light of day. But the night,
the impenetrable night, thicker than walls and empty; the infinite
night, so black, so vast, in which one might brush against frightful
things; the night, when one feels that a mysterious terror is
wandering, prowling about, appeared to him to conceal an unknown
threatening danger, close beside him.

What was it?
He knew ere long. As he sat in his armchair, rather late one evening
when he could not sleep, he thought he saw the curtain of his window
move. He waited, uneasily, with beating heart. The drapery did not
stir; then, all of a sudden, it moved once more. He did not venture
to rise; he no longer ventured to breathe, and yet he was brave.
He had often fought, and he would have liked to catch thieves in
his house.
Was it true that this curtain did move? he asked himself, fearing
that his eyes had deceived him. It was, moreover, such a slight
thing, a gentle flutter of drapery, a kind of trembling in its
folds, less than an undulation caused by the wind.
Renardet sat still, with staring eyes and outstretched neck.And I have
never had any trouble in my mind since then. My communion seasons
were always bright and blessed seasons to me as long as I was able
to go to church. And though I can no longer go up to the sanctuary
and partake of the bread and wine, "the outward and visible signs"
made use of in the heavenly feast; yet, blessed be God's holy name, I
can, and do partake in a spiritual manner of that which those signs
represent. I feel and know what it is to have "Christ in me the hope
of glory." And this "satisfies my longing, as nothing else can do." I
find peace and comfort in simply "looking unto Jesus." I have had
much outward trouble and affliction since then. I live alone. There
is no one here to help me. Sometimes I have nothing to eat, and but
little to keep me warm. You see me _sitting_ here now. Thus I have to
spend my nights. My complaint is the dropsy, and this prevents me
from lying down. _But I would not exchange my place as a forgiven
sinner, with "Christ in me the hope of glory," for all the wealth and
the honor that Queen Victoria could bestow upon me!_'"

What a blessed Saviour Jesus is, who can thus spread the sunshine of
his peace and hope through the hearts and homes of the poorest and
most afflicted in the land!

And thus, we have spoken of three good reasons, why all who love our
Lord Jesus Christ should keep this solemn sacrament which he has
ordained; we should do it because we see in it--_the word of his
command--the memorial of his sufferings--and the hope of his glory_.

And when we partake of this solemn ordinance ourselves, or see others
partaking of it, how well we may say in the beautiful lines of
Havergal, the English poetess:

    "Thou art coming! At thy table
    We are witnesses for this,
    While remembering hearts thou meetest,
    In communion closest, sweetest,
    Earnest of our coming bliss.
    Showing not thy death alone,
    And thy love exceeding great,
    But thy coming, and thy throne,
    All for which we long and wait.

    "O the joy to see thee reigning,
    Thee, our own beloved Lord;
    Every tongue thy name confessing,
    Worship, honor, glory, blessing,
    Brought to thee with glad accord,
    Thee our master and our Friend,
    Vindicated and enthroned;
    Unto earth's remotest end,
    Glorified, adored, and owned."

"_THIS DO IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME_."

THE WOMAN OF CANAAN


Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, _thou_ son of
David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered
her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send
her away; for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not
sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she
and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said,
It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast _it_ to
dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answered and said unto
her, O woman, great _is_ thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou
wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.--_St.
Matt. xv: 21-28_.

SIMON PETER'S FAITH IN CHRIST


When Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they
said, Some _say that thou art_ John the Baptist: some, Elias; and
others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But
whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art
the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said
unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath
not revealed _it_ unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I
say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then
charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was
Jesus the Christ.--_St. Matt, xvi: 13-20_.

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_The site of Cæsarea Philippi is one of the loveliest spots in
Northern Palestine. On ground carpeted with an infinite variety of
wild flowers, the traveller rests in the grateful shade of oak and
mulberry, olive and fig tree. The sound of many waters is heard on
all sides as they hasten from the adjacent slopes of Herman to join
the head waters of Jordan, bursting in strength from a cavern at the
foot of a mighty cliff. Hither, with his handful of followers, came
Jesus, weary and in deep depression of spirit, a fugitive from his
own people, who had finally rejected him; and here, in reply to
searching and anxious enquiry, "Whom say ye that I am?" he received
from Simon Peter the memorable confession, "Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God_."


THE TRANSFIGURATION OF CHRIST


And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother,
and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart. And was
transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his
raiment was white as the light. And, behold, there appeared unto them
Moses and Elias talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto
Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make
here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
Elias. While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
and behold a voice out of the cloud which said, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. And when the disciples
heard _it_, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus
came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. And when
they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus
only.--_St. Matt, xvii: 1--8_.

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_From the days of St. Jerome, when pilgrims first began the attempt
to identify sites hallowed by sacred events, Mount Tabor has, until
recent years, been regarded as the Mount of the Transfiguration. But
closer examination of the text and comparison of dates, and the fact
that Tabor itself was at that time the site of a fortified town
containing a Roman garrison, combine in this instance to discredit
tradition. One of the spurs of Herman must therefore be the
alternative and more probable scene of the Transfiguration; the
seclusion of this district of mountain, valley, and woodland
providing opportunity for contemplation, and preparation for the end
which was now imminent, "the decease which Jesus was to accomplish at
Jerusalem"_.


JESUS HEALETH A LUNATIC


And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down
from the hill, much people met him. And, behold, a man of the company
cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he
is mine only child. And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly
crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising
him hardly departeth from him. And I besought thy disciples to cast
him out; and they could not. And Jesus answering said, O faithless
and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer
you? Bring thy son hither. And as he was yet a coming, the devil
threw him down, and tare _him_. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit,
and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.--_St.
Luke ix: 37-42_When they entered the great city they were bewildered by its size
and by the crowds that they saw.

       But they knew that Jean must be in the midst of all these people,
though they did not know how to set about looking for him.

Then they feared that they might not recognize him, for he was only
five years old when they last saw him.

They visited every place, went through all the streets, stopping
whenever they saw a group of people, hoping for some providential
meeting, some extraordinary luck, some compassionate fate.

They frequently walked at haphazard straight ahead, leaning one
against the other, looking so sad and poverty-stricken that people
would give them alms without their asking.

They spent every Sunday at the doors of the churches, watching the
crowds entering and leaving, trying to distinguish among the faces
one that might be familiar.

Several times they thought they recognized him, but always found they
had made a mistake.

In the vestibule of one of the churches which they visited the most
frequently there was an old dispenser of holy Water who had become
their friend. He also had a very sad history, and their sympathy for
him had established a bond of close friendship between them. It ended
by them all three living together in a poor lodging on the top
floor of a large house situated at some distance, quite on the
outskirts of the city, and the wheelwright would sometimes take his
new friend's place at the church when the latter was ill.

Winter came, a very severe winter. The poor holy water sprinkler died
and the parish priest appointed the wheelwright, whose misfortunes
had come to his knowledge, to replace him. He went every morning
and sat in the same place, on the same chair, wearing away the
old stone pillar by continually leaning against it. He would gaze
steadily at every man who entered the church and looked forward to
Sunday with as much impatience as a schoolboy, for on that day the
church was filled with people from morning till night.

       He became very old, growing weaker each day from the dampness of
the church, and his hope oozed away gradually.

He now knew by sight all the people who came to the services; he
knew their hours, their manners, could distinguish their step on
the stone pavement.

His interests had become so contracted that the entrance of a
stranger in the church was for him a great event. One day two ladies
came in; one was old, the other young--a mother and daughter
probably. Behind them came a man who was following them. He bowed to
them as they came out, and after offering them some holy water, he
took the arm of the elder lady.

"That must be the fiance of the younger one," thought the
wheelwright.
And until evening he kept trying to recall where he had formerly
seen a young man who resembled this one.

But the one he was thinking of must be an old man by this time, for
it seemed as if he had known him down home in his youth.

The same man frequently came again to walk home with the ladies, and
this vague, distant, familiar resemblance which he could not place
worried the old man so much that he made his wife come with him
to see if she could help his impaired memory.

One evening as it was growing dusk the three strangers entered
together.
When they had passed the old man said:

"Well, do you know him?"
His wife anxiously tried to ransack her memory. Suddenly she said
in a low tone:

       "Yes--yes--but he is darker, taller, stouter and is dressed like a
gentleman, but, father, all the same, it is your face when you were
young!"

The old man started violently.

It was true. He looked like himself and also like his brother who
was dead, and like his father, whom he remembered while he was yet
young. The old couple were so affected that they could not speak.
The three persons came out and were about to leave the church.

The man touched his finger to the holy water sprinkler.

Then the old man, whose hand was trembling so that he was fairly
sprinkling the ground with holy water, exclaimed:

"Jean!"
The young man stopped and looked at him.

He repeated in a lower tone:

"Jean!"
The two women looked at them without understanding.

       He then said for the third time, sobbing as he did so:

"Jean!"

The man stooped down, with his face close to the old man's, and as
a memory of his childhood dawned on him he replied:
"Papa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne!"

He had forgotten everything, his father's surname and the name of
his native place, but he always remembered those two words that
he had so often repeated: "Papa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne."
He sank to the floor, his face on the old man's knees, and he wept,
kissing now his father and then his mother, while they were almost
breathless from intense joy.

The two ladies also wept, understanding as they did that some great
happiness had come to pass.

Then they all went to the young man's house and he told them his
history.
The circus people had carried him off. For three years he traveled
with them in various countries.Here some years ago a French explorer
discovered on the base the remains of an ancient chapel This seems to
point with probability to a valid tradition of the site of the house
of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus_.


JESUS BLESSETH LITTLE CHILDREN


And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them:
and _his_ disciples rebuked those that brought _them_. But when Jesus
saw _it_, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the
little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter
therein. And he took them up in his arms, put _his_ hands upon them,
and blessed them.--_St. Mark x: 13-16._

       *       *       *       *       *

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_In the Hebrew Bible--the Talmud--it is stated that, according to
pious custom, parents brought their little children to the synagogue
that they might receive the benefit of the prayers and blessings of
the elders. Rabbis also, of recognized sanctity, were frequently
appealed to in a like manner; and his fame as a prophet and
benefactor having preceded him into Peraea, infants were now brought
to Jesus, that he might lay his hands upon them in supplication and
blessing. The architectural setting of the picture is adapted from
that of a small square near the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem. This
kindly and gentle act of our Lord has been of incalculable
consequence to the life of children in the development of Christian
civilization._


THE RESURRECTION OF LAZARUS, FOUR DAYS DEAD


Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for
your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;
nevertheless let us go unto him. Jesus therefore again groaning in
himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that
was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath
been _dead_ four days. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee,
that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
Then they took away the stone _from the place_ where the dead was
laid. And Jesus lifted up _his_ eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee
that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but
because of the people which stand by I said _it_, that they may
believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came
forth.--_St. John xi: 14., 15,38-44._

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_The painting illustrates a form of rock-cut tomb which, though not
so common as others in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, is nevertheless
selected as being in accordance with the description of what took
place in the present instance. It is obviously the type of tomb which
is referred to on a subsequent occasion, and explains the meaning of
"the stone rolled away from the sepulchre" The entrance of the tomb
is at the bottom of a flight of steps, and is covered by a
disc-shaped stone, like a mill-stone, which can be rolled back into a
slot cut in the rock for its reception. (The kneeling man in the
background has apparently just performed this duty?) The entrance is
closed by rolling the stone forward, dropping a small block behind it
to prevent its recession, and finally by covering the
before-mentioned slot with a slab, which, being cemented down, the
tomb is "sealed."_


CONVERSION OF ZACCHAEUS, A PUBLICAN


And _Jesus_ entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, _there
was_ a man named Zacchæus, which was the chief among the publicans,
and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not
for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before,
and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass
that _way_. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw
him, and said unto him, Zacchæus, make haste, and come down; for to
day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and
received him joyfully. And when they saw _it_, they all murmured,
saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. And
Zacchæus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man
by false accusation, I restore _him_ fourfold. And Jesus said unto
him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also
is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save
that which was lost.--_St. Luke xix: 1-10_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_The sycomore tree referred to in the text is a species of fig
bearing small, coarse fruit, which is used as food only in cases of
necessity. Although occasionally of great size, the tree is easily
climbed, as the trunk is short, and the branches are numerous and
wide spreading. Jericho, rebuilt by Herod, was a somewhat fashionable
town. To signalize the despised tax-gatherer in such a way was to
teach a permanent lesson of absolute unworldliness_.


JESUS RESTORETH SIGHT TO BARTIMAEUS


And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it
was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, _thou_
son of David, have mercy on me. And many charged him that he should
hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, _Thou_ son of
David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to
be called. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good
comfort, rise; he calleth thee. And he, casting away his garment,
rose, and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What
wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him,
Lord, that I might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy
way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his
sight, and followed Jesus in the way.--_St. Mark x: 4.6--52._

       *       *       *       *       *

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_The site of Jericho is still an oasis in the surrounding desert, but
neither its fertility nor its dimensions bear comparison with those
which it attained in former days; and hardly a tree remains of the
celebrated groves of balsam, spice, and fruit-bearing trees, and the
palms which earned for Jericho the title of "The City of the Palm
Trees," and which made its neighboring plain the garden of
Palestine--the "divine district" as Joseph us calls it. This
fertility was owing entirely to skilful irrigation, traces of no less
than twelve aqueducts having been discovered. No class of sufferers
more frequently claimed and obtained from Jesus the exercise of his
compassion and healing power than that represented by blind
Bartimaus. The malady of blindness is grievously common in Palestine,
the proportion of those thus afflicted being one in every hundred of
the population, whereas in Europe the proportion is only one in a
thousand_.


CHRIST'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM


And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage,
unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples. Saying unto
them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall
find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose _them_, and bring _them_
unto me. I answered: 'Madame, my parents were wretches who deserted
me.' Then she clutched at her heart and fell, unconscious. I
immediately thought: 'She is my mother!' but I took care not to let
her notice anything. I wished to observe her.

"I, in turn, sought out information about them. I learned that they had
been married since last July, my mother having been a widow for
only three years. There had been rumors that they had loved each
other during the lifetime of the first husband, but there was no
proof of it. I was the proof--the proof which they had at first
hidden and then hoped to destroy.

"I waited.

       She returned one evening, escorted as usual by my father.

That day she seemed deeply moved, I don't know why.

Then, as she was leaving, she said to me: 'I wish you success,
because you seem to me to be honest and a hard worker; some day
you will undoubtedly think of getting married. I have come to
help you to choose freely the woman who may suit you. I was married
against my inclination once and I know what suffering it causes.
Now I am rich, childless, free, mistress of my fortune. Here is your
dowry.'
"She held out to me a large, sealed envelope.

"I looked her straight in the eyes and then said: 'Are you my
mother?'

"She drew back a few steps and hid her face in her hands so as not
to see me. He, the man, my father, supported her in his arms and cried
out to me: 'You must be crazy!'
"I answered: 'Not in the least. I know that you are my parents. I
cannot be thus deceived. Admit it and I will keep the secret; I will
bear you no ill will; I will remain what I am, a carpenter.'
"He retreated towards the door, still supporting his wife who was
beginning to sob. Quickly I locked the door, put the key in my pocket
and continued: 'Look at her and dare to deny that she is my mother.'

"Then he flew into a passion, very pale, terrified at the thought
that the scandal, which had so far been avoided, might suddenly break
out; that their position, their good name, their honor might all
at once be lost. He stammered out: 'You are a rascal, you wish to
get money from us!
That's the thanks we get for trying to help such common people!'

       "My mother, bewildered, kept repeating: 'Let's get out of here,
let's get out!'

"Then, when he found the door locked, he exclaimed: 'If you do not
open this door immediately, I will have you thrown into prison for
blackmail and assault!'

"I had remained calm; I opened the door and saw them disappear
in the darkness.

"Then I seemed to have been suddenly orphaned, deserted, pushed to the
wall. I was seized with an overwhelming sadness, mingled with anger,
hatred, disgust; my whole being seemed to rise up in revolt against
the injustice, the meanness, the dishonor, the rejected love.

I began to run, in order to overtake them along the Seine, which
they had to follow in order to reach the station of Chaton.

"I soon caught up with them. It was now pitch dark. I was creeping
up behind them softly, that they might not hear me. My mother
was still crying.

       My father was saying: 'It's all your own fault.

Why did you wish to see him?

It was absurd in our position. We could have helped him from afar,
without showing ourselves. Of what use are these dangerous visits,
since we can't recognize him?'
"Then I rushed up to them, beseeching. I cried:

"'You see! You are my parents. You have already rejected me once;
would you repulse me again?'
"Then, your honor, he struck me. I swear it on my honor, before the
law and my country. He struck me, and as I seized him by the collar,
he drew from his pocket a revolver.
"The blood rushed to my head, I no longer knew what I was doing, I
had my compass in my pocket; I struck him with it as often as I
could.
"Then she began to cry: 'Help! murder!' and to pull my beard. It
seems that I killed her also. How do I know what I did then?
"Then, when I saw them both lying on the ground, without thinking,
I threw them into the Seine.

"That's all. Now sentence me."
The prisoner sat down.The citadel of
Jerusalem breaks the skyline where stood the tower of Hippicus, and
to the left, against the setting sun, the cypresses in a monastery
garden mark the spot once covered by the gardens of the palace of
Herod. Siloam stands as of old on the hither side, overlooking the
valleys of Hinnom and Kidron; while to-day, as in former times, the
olive yards beneath and the trees around, might well give the name
which it bears to the hill on which we stand._


JESUS WASHETH HIS DISCIPLES' FEET


Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,
having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the
end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot, Simon's _son_, to betray him. Jesus knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come
from God, and went to God. He riseth from supper, and laid aside his
garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth
water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to
wipe _them_ with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to
Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but
thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no
part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but
also _my_ hands and _my_ head. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed
needeth not save to wash _his_ feet, but is clean every whit: and ye
are clean, but not all.--_St. John xiii: 1-10._

_A dwelling house, claiming to be one of the most ancient in
Jerusalem, supplied materials for the study of the "large upper
room," represented in this and some other of the paintings. The
general features of the chamber, with its arched ceiling and
flattened dome, its_ leewans _(raised platform) and the
entrance-passage of colored stones, where guests leave their

may, for the reasons adduced elsewhere, be accepted as typical of
similar apartments of the period under consideration._


THE BETRAYAL FORETOLD AT THE SUPPER


When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified,
and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall
betray me. "Continue," said M. Putoin.

Renardet, while proceeding with his toilet, reviewed the characters
of all the inhabitants of Carvelin. After two hours' discussion their
suspicions were fixed on three individuals who had hitherto borne a
shady reputation--a poacher named Cavalle, a fisherman named Paquet,
who caught trout and crabs, and a cattle drover named Clovis.
II
The search for the perpetrator of the crime lasted all summer, but
he was not discovered. Those who were suspected and arrested easily
proved their innocence, and the authorities were compelled to abandon
the attempt to capture the criminal.

But this murder seemed to have moved the entire country in a singular
manner.

       There remained in every one's mind a disquietude, a vague fear, a
sensation of mysterious terror, springing not merely from the
impossibility of discovering any trace of the assassin, but also
and above all from that strange finding of the wooden shoes in front
of La Roque's door the day after the crime.

The certainty that the murderer had assisted at the investigation,
that he was still, doubtless, living in the village, possessed all
minds and seemed to brood over the neighborhood like a constant
menace.

The wood had also become a dreaded spot, a place to be avoided and
supposed to be haunted.

Formerly the inhabitants went there to spend every Sunday afternoon.
They used to sit down on the moss at the feet of the huge tall trees
or walk along the water's edge watching the trout gliding
among the weeds. The boy's used to play bowls, hide-and-seek
and other games where the ground had been cleared and levelled, and
the girls, in rows of four or five, would trip along, holding one
another by the arms and screaming songs with their shrill voices. Now
nobody ventured there for fear of finding some corpse lying on the
ground.

Autumn arrived, the leaves began to fall from the tall trees, whirling
round and round to the ground, and the sky could be seen through the
bare branches. Sometimes, when a gust of wind swept over the tree
tops, the slow, continuous rain suddenly grew heavier and
became a rough storm that covered the moss with a thick yellow carpet
that made a kind of creaking sound beneath one's feet.

And the sound of the falling leaves seemed like a wail and the leaves
themselves like tears shed by these great, sorrowful trees, that
wept in the silence of the bare and empty wood, this dreaded and
deserted wood where wandered lonely the soul, the little soul of
little Louise Roque.

The Brindille, swollen by the storms, rushed on more quickly, yellow
and angry, between its dry banks, bordered by two thin, bare, willow
hedges.

And here was Renardet suddenly resuming his walks under the trees.
Every day, at sunset, he came out of his house, descended the front
steps slowly and entered the wood in a dreamy fashion, with his
hands in his pockets, and paced over the damp soft moss, while a
legion of rooks from all the neighboring haunts came thither to
rest in the tall trees and then flew off like a black cloud uttering
loud, discordant cries.Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that
doth betray me.--_St. Matt, xxvi: 36-46._

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_As the word Gethsemane means the "oil press" the "Garden" was in all
probability an olive yard, whose actual site, though it cannot be
determined with certainty, must have been in the immediate vicinity
at least of the spot which age-long tradition indicates as the scene
of the Agony. The great age of the trees in this enclosure has been
urged in favor of the tradition, but it is fatal to their claim as
witnesses, that Titus is known to have cut down, for military
purposes, all the trees in the neighborhood of the besieged city.
This site is now owned by the Russians who have turned it into a neat
and trim garden, and built a bright new white church on the upper
level with five large gilded bulbous domes_.





THE ARREST OF JESUS





Judas then, having received a band _of men_ and officers from the
chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come
upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered
him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am _he_. And Judas
also, which betrayed him, stood with them. As soon then as he had
said unto them, I am _he_, they went backward, and fell to the
ground.--Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying,
Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. And
forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came
they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. And, behold, one of them
which were with Jesus stretched out _his_ hand, and drew his sword,
and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for
all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest
thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give
me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the
scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? In that same hour said
Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with
swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in
the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. But all this was done, that
the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the
disciples forsook him, and fled.--_St. John xviii: 3-6; St. Matt,
xxvi: 48-56._

       *       *       *       *       *

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_Cunningly conceived indeed was that signal of the kiss; for in the
very act of betrayal, Judas thus covered his own treachery; and, had
the plot failed, it would even have appeared as if, when "all the
disciples forsook him and fled" Judas alone had courage, in the hour
of danger, to stand by and openly to acknowledge Jesus as his
Master_.





JESUS EXAMINED BY CAIAPHAS




And they that had laid hold on Jesus led _him_ away to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. But
Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went
in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. Now the chief priests,
and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus,
to put him to death. But found none: yea, though many false witnesses
came, _yet_ found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
And said, This _fellow_ said, I am able to destroy the temple of God,
and to build it in three days. And the high priest arose, and said
unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what _is it which_ these witness
against thee? But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered
and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus saith unto him,
Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see
the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the
clouds of heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He
hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses?
behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye? They answered
and said, He is guilty of death.--_St. Matt, xxvi: 57--66._

       *       *       *       *       *

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_The outward ceremonial of the hastily convoked and Irregular
tribunal before which Jesus underwent the mockery of a trial was
similar to that of the ancient Sanhedrim. The members sat on a
semi-circular divan, the president in the centre, and a scribe at
each extremity, who recorded the evidence and the decisions of the
court. It may be noted, that while laws had been carefully formulated
for the conduct of such trials, almost every one of them was
flagrantly violated on the present occasion in order to ensure a
pre-arranged condemnation. For example, these rules provided that
witnesses should be summoned, and that an advocate should plead on
behalf of the accused; and they forbade that criminal trials should
be conducted at night, that condemnation should be pronounced on the
day of trial or on a holy day; and, if the crime were capital, that
execution should follow on the day of sentence_.





JESUS IS THRICE DENIED BY PETER




Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. He did not think of
the matter again till just as he was getting into bed, when he noticed
a red stain upon his handkerchief. He frowned and examined his hand
carefully. There was no sign of any wound or cut from which the blood
could have come, and he frowned again.

"Very odd!" he muttered.

A calendar hanging on the wall reminded him that it was the first
of the month.

The days passed, the incident faded from his memory, and four weeks
later he came down one morning to breakfast in an unusually good
temper.
There was a certain theory he had worked on the night before he
meant to write to a friend about. It seemed to him his demonstration
had been really brilliant, and then, also, he was already planning
out with great success the details of the scheme for his great work.Luke xxii: 61, 62_.

_NOTE BY THE ARTIST_

_In the East, the houses of the great and official residences usually
consist of a group of separate yet connected buildings, surrounding a
quadrangular paved court planted with trees and flowering shrubs, and
furnished in the centre with an open cistern or fountain. Such was
probably the construction of the palace of the High Priest
(Caiaphas), and, apparently, this open court, across which Jesus
would be conducted to or from the hall of trial, was the place where
bitterness was added to his sorrow in hearing himself denied by his
friend--and that man who had been the first to profess belief in his
Messiahship, and who, but a few brief hours before, had stoutly sworn
to stand by him, even unto death_.
