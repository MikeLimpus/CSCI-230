ISOLDA.
His praise briskly they sing now:--
"Bravo, our brave Tristan!"--
he was that distressful man.
A thousand protestations
of truth and love he prated.
Hear how a knight
fealty knows!--
When as Tantris
unforbidden he'd left me,
as Tristan
boldly back he came,
in stately ship
from which in pride
Ireland's heiress
in marriage he asked
for Mark, the Cornish monarch,
his kinsman worn and old.
In Morold's lifetime
dared any have dreamed
to offer us such an insult?
For the tax-paying
Cornish prince
to presume to court Ireland's princess!
Ah, woe is me!
I it was
who for myself
did shape this shame!
with death-dealing sword
should I have stabbed him;
weakly it escaped me:--
now serfdom I have shaped me.
Curse him, the villain!
Curse on his head!
Vengeance! Death!
Death for me too!

BRANGÆNA (_throwing herself upon_ ISOLDA _with impetuous
tenderness_).
Isolda! lady!
loved one! fairest!
sweet perfection!
mistress rarest!
Hear me! come now,
sit thee here.--

(_Gradually draws_ ISOLDA _to the couch_.)

What a whim!
what causeless railing!
How came you so wrong-minded
and by mere fancy blinded?
Sir Tristan gives thee
Cornwall's kingdom;
then, were he erst thy debtor,
how could he reward thee better?
His noble uncle
serves he so:
think too what a gift
on thee he'd bestow!
With honor unequalled
all he's heir to
at thy feet he seeks to shower,
to make thee a queenly dower.

(ISOLDA _turns away_.)

If wife he'd make thee
unto King Mark
why wert thou in this wise complaining?
Is he not worth thy gaining?
Of royal race
and mild of mood,
who passes King Mark
in might and power?
If a noble knight
like Tristan serves him,
who would not but feel elated,
so fairly to be mated.

ISOLDA (_gazing vacantly before her_).
Glorious knight!
And I must near him
loveless ever languish!
How can I support such anguish?

BRANGÆNA.
What's this, my lady?
loveless thou?

(_Approaching coaxingly and kissing_ ISOLDA.)

Where lives there a man
would not love thee?
Who could see Isolda
And not sink
at once into bondage blest?
And if e'en it could be
any were cold,
did any magic
draw him from thee,
I'd bring the false one
back to bondage,
And bind him in links of love.--

(_Secretly and confidentially, close to_ ISOLDA.)

Mindest thou not
thy mother's arts?
Think you that she
who'd mastered those
would have sent me o'er the sea,
without assistance for thee?

ISOLDA (_darkly_).
My mother's rede
I mind aright,
and highly her magic
arts I hold:--
Vengeance they wreak for wrongs,
rest give to wounded spirits.--
Yon casket hither bear.

BRANGÆNA.
It holds a balm for thee.--

(_She brings forward a small golden coffer, opens it, and points to
its contents_.)

Thy mother placed inside it
her subtle magic potions.
There's salve for sickness
or for wounds,
and antidotes
for deadly drugs.--

(_She takes a bottle_.)

The helpfullest draught
I hold in here.

ISOLDA.
Not so, I know a better.
I make a mark
to know it again--
This draught 'tis I would drain.

(_Seizes flask and shows it_.)

BRANGÆNA (_recoiling in horror_).
The draught of death!

(ISOLDA _has risen from the sofa and now hears with increasing dread
the cries of the sailors_.)

VOICES OF THE CREW (_without_).
"Ho! heave ho! hey!
Reduce the sail!
The mainsail in!
Ho! heave ho! hey!"

ISOLDA.
Our journey has been swift.
Woe is me! Near to the land!


SCENE IV.

(KURVENAL _boisterously enters through the curtains_.)

KURVENAL.
Up, up, ye ladies!
Look alert!
Straight bestir you!
Loiter not,--here is the land!--
To dame Isolda
says the servant
of Tristan,
our hero true:--
Behold our flag is flying!
it waveth landwards aloft:
in Mark's ancestral castle
may our approach be seen.
So, dame Isolda,
he prays to hasten,
for land straight to prepare her,
that thither he may bear her.

ISOLDA (_who has at first cowered and shuddered on hearing the
message, now speaks calmly and with dignity_). My greeting take
unto your lord
and tell him what I say now:
Should he assist to land me
and to King Mark would he hand me,
unmeet and unseemly
were his act,
the while my pardon
was not won
for trespass black and base:
So bid him seek my grace.

(KURVENAL _makes a gesture of defiance_.)

Before we arrived
at this island, we
had passed a great many native
towns and villages, but in
consequence of the early hour
at which we were travelling,
we considered it would
be imprudent to
stop at any of
them, as none of
the natives were out of
their huts.KURVENAL.
Be assured,
I'll bear your words:
we'll see what he will say!

(_He retires quickly_.)


SCENE V.

ISOLDA (_hurries to_ BRANGÆNA _and embraces her vehemently_).
Now farewell, Brangæna!
Greet ev'ry one,
Greet my father and mother!

BRANGÆNA.
What now? what mean'st thou?
Wouldst thou flee?
And where must I then follow?

ISOLDA (_checking herself suddenly_).
Here I remain:
heard you not?
Tristan will I await.--
I trust in thee
to aid in this:
prepare the true
cup of peace:
thou mindest how it is made.

BRANGÆNA.
What meanest thou?

ISOLDA (_taking a bottle from the coffer_).
This it is!
From the flask go pour
this philtre out;
yon golden goblet 'twill fill.

BRANGÆNA (_filled with terror receiving the flask_).
Trust I my wits?

ISOLDA.
Wilt thou be true?

BRANGÆNA.
The draught--for whom?

ISOLDA. Him who betrayed!

BRANGÆNA. Tristan?

ISOLDA. Truce he'll drink with me.

BRANGÆNA (_throwing herself at_ ISOLDA'S _feet_). O horror!
Pity thy handmaid!

ISOLDA. Pity thou me,
false-hearted maid!
Mindest thou not
my mother's arts?
Think you that she
who'd mastered those
would have sent thee o'er the sea
without assistance for me?
A salve for sickness
doth she offer
and antidotes
for deadly drugs:
for deepest grief
and woe supreme
gave she the draught of death.
Let Death now give her thanks!

BRANGÆNA (_scarcely able to control herself_). O deepest
grief!

ISOLDA. Now, wilt thou obey?

BRANGÆNA. O woe supreme!

ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?

BRANGÆNA. The draught?

KURVENAL (_entering_). Sir Tristan!

(BRANGÆNA _rises, terrified and confused_. ISOLDA _strives with
immense effort to control herself_.)

ISOLDA (_to Kurvenal_). Sir Tristan may approach!


SCENE VI.

[KURVENAL _retires again_. BRANGÆNA, _almost beside herself,
turns up the stage_. ISOLDA, _mustering all her powers of
resolution, walks slowly and with dignity towards the sofa, by the
head of which she supports herself, turning her eyes firmly towards
the entrance_]

(TRISTAN _enters, and pauses respectfully at the entrance_.)

TRISTAN. Demand, lady,
what you will.

ISOLDA. While knowing not
what my demand is,
wert thou afraid
still to fulfil it,
fleeing my presence thus?

TRISTAN. Honor
Held me in awe.

ISOLDA. Scant honor hast thou
shown unto me;
for, unabashed,
withheldest thou
obedience unto my call.

TRISTAN. Obedience 'twas
forbade me to come.

ISOLDA. But little I owe
thy lord, methinks,
if he allows
ill manners
unto his own promised bride.

TRISTAN. In our land
it is the law
that he who fetches
home the bride
should stay afar from her.

ISOLDA. On what account?

TRISTAN. 'Tis the custom.

ISOLDA. Being so careful,
my lord Tristan,
another custom
can you not learn?
Of enemies friends make:
for evil acts amends make.

TRISTAN. Who is my foe?

ISOLDA. Find in thy fears!
Blood-guilt
gets between us.

TRISTAN. That was absolved.

ISOLDA. Not between us.

TRISTAN. In open field,
'fore all the folk
our old feud was abandoned.
