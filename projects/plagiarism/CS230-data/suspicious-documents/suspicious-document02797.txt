NOTE TO THIS ELECTRONIC EDITION

The text of this electronic edition was originally produced by Sandra
K. Perry, Perrysburg, Ohio, and made available through the Christian
Classics Ethereal Library <http://www.ccel.org>. I have eliminated
unnecessary formatting in the text, corrected some errors in
transcription, and added the dedication, tables of contents,
Prologue, and the numbers of the questions and articles, as they
appeared in the printed translation published by Benziger Brothers.
Each article is now designated by part, question number, and article
number in brackets, like this:

> SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 49, Art. 2]

> Whether the Supreme Good, God, Is the Cause of Evil?

In a few places, where obvious errors appeared in the Benziger
Brothers edition, I have corrected them by reference to a Latin text
of the _Summa._ These corrections are indicated by English text in
brackets. For example, in Part I, Question 45, Article 2, the first
sentence in the Benziger Brothers edition begins: "Not only is it
impossible that anything should be created by God...." By reference
to the Latin, "non solum _non_ est impossibile a Deo aliquid creari"
(emphasis added), this has been corrected to "Not only is it [not]
impossible that anything should be created by God...."

This electronic edition also differs from the Benziger Brothers
edition in the following details (as well as the obvious lack of the
original page numbers and headers):

* The repetitive expression "We proceed thus to the [next] Article"
does not appear directly below the title of each article.

* Italics are represented by underscores at the beginning and end,
_like this._ Quotations and other "quotable" matter, however, are
ordinarily set off by quotation marks with no underscores in this
edition, in accordance with common English usage, even where they
were set in italics with no quotation marks in the Benziger Brothers
edition. Titles of books are set off by underscores when they appear
in the text with no parentheses, but not when the books are cited in
parentheses.

* Bible chapters and verses are cited with arabic numerals separated
by colons, like this: "Dan. 7:10"--not like this: "Dan. vii. 10."
Small roman numerals have been retained where they appear in
citations to books other than the Bible.

* Any matter that appeared in a footnote in the Benziger Brothers
edition is presented in brackets at the point in the text where the
footnote mark appeared.

* Greek words are presented in Roman transliteration.

* Paragraphs are not indented and are separated by blank lines.

* Numbered topics, set forth at the beginning of each question and
at certain other places, are ordinarily presented on a separate line
for each topic.

* Titles of questions are in all caps.

Anything else in this electronic edition that does not correspond to
the content of the Benziger Brothers edition may be regarded as a
defect in this edition and attributed to me (David McClamrock).

pretender, it is you who are suffering from an overdose of
arrogant
spirits. Your head
will soon kiss the
dust.

"KING". Princes,
these heavy
jokes are not worthy of a king.

KANCHI. Those who
will jest
properly with you are near at hand.
General!

"KING". No more, I
entreat you. I can see plainly I owe homage to you all. The head
     is bowing down
of itself--there is
no need for the application
of any sharp
methods to lay it low.

So here I do my obeisance to you all.

If you kindly allow
me to escape I
shall not
inflict my presence
long on you.

KANCHI. Why should
you escape? We will
make you king of
this place--let
us carry our joke to
its legitimate finish.
Have you got any
following?

"KING". I have. Every one who sees me in
the streets flocks after me.
When I had a meagre retinue at
first every one
regarded me with suspicion, but now with
the increasing crowd their doubts are waning
and dissolving. The
crowd is being
hypnotised by its
own magnitude.
I have not got
to do anything
now.

KANCHI. That's
excellent!
From this moment we all
promise to help and
stand by you. But you
will have to do us one service
in return.

"KING". Your
commands and the
crown you are
putting on my head will be
equally binding and sacred to me.

KANCHI. At present we
want nothing more
than a sight of the Queen Sudarshana. You will have to see to
this.

"KING". I shall spare no pains for that.

KANCHI. We cannot put much faith
on your pains--you will be solely directed by our instructions.
But now you can go and join the
festivities in
the royal arbour with all
possible splendour and magnificence.[They go out.]

[Enter GRANDFATHER and a band of people]
FIRST CITIZEN. Grandfather, I
cannot help saying--yes,
and repeating it five hundred times--that our King is a perfect
fraud.

GRANDFATHER. Why only five hundred times? There
is no need to practise such heroic self-control--you can say it five
thousand times if that adds to your pleasure.

SECOND CITIZEN. But you cannot keep up a
dead lie forever.

GRANDFATHER. It has made me
alive, my friend.

THIRD CITIZEN. We shall proclaim to the whole
world that our King is a lie, the merest and emptiest shadow!

FIRST CITIZEN.

We shall all shout from our housetops that we have no King--let him
do whatever he likes if he exists.

GRANDFATHER. He will do nothing at all.

SECOND CITIZEN. My son died untimely at twenty-five of raging fever
in seven days. Could such a calamity befall me under the rule of
a virtuous King?
GRANDFATHER. But you still have got two sons left: while I have
lost all my five children one after another.
THIRD CITIZEN. What do you say now?
GRANDFATHER. What then? Shall I lose my King too because I have
lost my children? Don't take me for such a big fool as that.
FIRST CITIZEN. It is a fine thing to argue whether there is a King
or not when one is simply starving for want of food! Will the King
save us?
GRANDFATHER. Brother, you are right. But why not <i>find</i>
the King who owns all the food? You certainly will not find by your
wailings at home.
SECOND CITIZEN. Look at the justice of our King! That Bhadrasen--you
know what a touching sight he is when he is speaking of his King--the
sentimental idiot!About faith itself we shall consider: (1) its object; (2) its act;
(3) the habit of faith.

Under the first head there are ten points of inquiry:

(1) Whether the object of faith is the First Truth?

(2) Whether the object of faith is something complex or incomplex,
i.e. whether it is a thing or a proposition?

(3) Whether anything false can come under faith?

(4) Whether the object of faith can be anything seen?

(5) Whether it can be anything known?

(6) Whether the things to be believed should be divided into a
certain number of articles?

(7) Whether the same articles are of faith for all times?

(8) Of the number of articles;

(9) Of the manner of embodying the articles in a symbol;

(10) Who has the right to propose a symbol of faith?
_______________________

FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 1]

Whether the Object of Faith Is the First Truth?

Objection 1: It would seem that the object of faith is not the First
Truth. For it seems that the object of faith is that which is
proposed to us to be believed. Now not only things pertaining to the
Godhead, i.e. the First Truth, are proposed to us to be believed, but
also things concerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments of
the Church, and the condition of creatures. Therefore the object of
faith is not only the First Truth.

Obj. 2: Further, faith and unbelief have the same object since they
are opposed to one another. Now unbelief can be about all things
contained in Holy Writ, for whichever one of them a man denies, he is
considered an unbeliever. Therefore faith also is about all things
contained in Holy Writ. But there are many things therein, concerning
man and other creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only
the First Truth, but also created truth.

Obj. 3: Further, faith is condivided with charity, as stated above
(I-II, Q. 62, A. 3). Now by charity we love not only God, who is the
sovereign Good, but also our neighbor. Therefore the object of Faith
is not only the First Truth.

_On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that "faith is
about the simple and everlasting truth." Now this is the First Truth.
Therefore the object of faith is the First Truth.

_I answer that,_ The object of every cognitive habit includes two
things: first, that which is known materially, and is the material
object, so to speak, and, secondly, that whereby it is known, which is
the formal aspect of the object. Thus in the science of geometry, the
conclusions are what is known materially, while the formal aspect of
the science is the mean of demonstration, through which the
conclusions are known.

Accordingly if we consider, in faith, the formal aspect of the
object, it is nothing else than the First Truth. For the faith of
which we are speaking, does not assent to anything, except because it
is revealed by God. Hence the mean on which faith is based is the
Divine Truth. If, however, we consider materially the things to which
faith assents, they include not only God, but also many other things,
which, nevertheless, do not come under the assent of faith, except as
bearing some relation to God, in as much as, to wit, through certain
effects of the Divine operation, man is helped on his journey towards
the enjoyment of God. Consequently from this point of view also the
object of faith is, in a way, the First Truth, in as much as nothing
comes under faith except in relation to God, even as the object of
the medical art is health, for it considers nothing save in relation
to health.

Reply Obj. 1: Things concerning Christ's human nature, and the
sacraments of the Church, or any creatures whatever, come under
faith, in so far as by them we are directed to God, and in as much
as we assent to them on account of the Divine Truth.

The same answer applies to the Second Objection, as regards all
things contained in Holy Writ.

Reply Obj. 3: Charity also loves our neighbor on account of God, so
that its object, properly speaking, is God, as we shall show further
on (Q. 25, A. 1).
_______________________

SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 2]

Whether the Object of Faith Is Something Complex, by Way of a
Proposition?

Objection 1: It would seem that the object of faith is not something
complex by way of a proposition. For the object of faith is the First
Truth, as stated above (A. 1). Now the First Truth is something
simple. Therefore the object of faith is not something complex.

ROHINI. It is pure affectation, the whole of it: which often goes a
longer way than open boasting. She is up to all manner of tricks:
that is why we could never like her.

SUDARSHANA.

But whatever you may say, I should have liked to ask her if she were
here.

ROHINI. Very well, Queen. I shall bring her here. She must be lucky
if she is indispensable for the Queen to know the King.
SUDARSHANA. Oh no--it isn't for that--but I would like to hear it
said by every one.

ROHINI.But the object of the heavenly vision is something simple, for it is
the Divine Essence. Therefore the faith of the wayfarer is also.

_On the contrary,_ Faith is a mean between science and opinion. Now
the mean is in the same genus as the extremes. Since, then, science
and opinion are about propositions, it seems that faith is likewise
about propositions; so that its object is something complex.

_I answer that,_ The thing known is in the knower according to the
mode of the knower. Now the mode proper to the human intellect is to
know the truth by synthesis and analysis, as stated in the First Part
(Q. 85, A. 5). Hence things that are simple in themselves, are known
by the intellect with a certain amount of complexity, just as on the
other hand, the Divine intellect knows, without any complexity,
things that are complex in themselves.
