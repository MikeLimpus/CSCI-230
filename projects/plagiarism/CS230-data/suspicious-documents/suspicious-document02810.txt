The Armourers' Prentices

By Charlotte M. Yonge
________________________________________________________________
This is a story about two young orphans from Hampshire, who travel to
London in search of relatives.  On the way they rescue a prominent City
of London figure after he has been attacked by highwaymen, and in this
way they become attached to his household in the City.  The date is the
early years of Henry the Eighth, when the religious world of England is
simmering not only with the new views on religion, but also with the
problems of the King and his Divorces.  We meet great figures like Dean
Colet, famous even to this very day for his charitable foundations,
Thomas More, and other great figures of the pre-Reformation years.

It is a very lively story that rings true at every turn, and is worth
while reading for those who would like a further understanding of the
late Tudor Court, and the customs in the City, prevailing at the time of
the Reformation.

THE ARMOURERS' PRENTICES

CHAPTER ONE.

THE VERDURER'S LODGE.

"Give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament, with that I
will go buy me fortunes."

"Get you with him, you old dog."

_As You Like It_.

The officials of the New Forest have ever since the days of the
Conqueror enjoyed some of the pleasantest dwellings that southern
England can boast.

The home of the Birkenholt family was not one of the least delightful.
It stood at the foot of a rising ground, on which grew a grove of
magnificent beeches, their large silvery boles rising majestically like
columns into a lofty vaulting of branches, covered above with tender
green foliage.  Here and there the shade beneath was broken by the
gilding of a ray of sunshine on a lower twig, or on a white trunk, but
the floor of the vast arcades was almost entirely of the russet brown of
the fallen leaves, save where a fern or holly bush made a spot of green.
The title of _Gold Must be Tried by Fire_ (MACMILLAN) might be called
axiomatic for the precise type of fiction represented by the
story.
Because, if gold hadn't to be tried by fire, you might obviously marry
the hero and heroine on the first page and save everybody much trouble
and expense. Mr. RICHARD AUMERLE MAHER, however, knows his job better
than that. True, he marries his heroine early, but to the wrong man, the
Labour leader and crook, _Will Lewis_, who vanishes just before
the entrance of the strong but unsilent hero, only to reappear
(under an alias) in time to get shot in a strike riot.

Mr. MAHER'S book comes, as you may already have guessed, from that
great country where they have replaced alcohol by sugar, and where
(perhaps in consequence) heroines of such super-sentimentality as _Daidie
Grattan_ have no terrors for them. Personally I found her and her
exploits on burning ships, besieged mills and the like a trifle sticky.
For the rest you have some interesting details of the workings
of the paper industry; a style that to the unfamiliar eye is at times
startling (as when, on page 282, the hero's head "snapped erect"); and
lots and lots of love. As for the ending, to relieve any apprehensions
on your part, let me quote it. "Taking her swiftly in his arms, he
questioned: 'Has the gold come free from the fire at last, my
darling?' 'Gold or dross,' she whispered as she yielded, 'it is
your own.'"

_Ah!_
* * * * *
_Love's Triumph_ (METHUEN) is concerned to a great extent with the development
of a raw Kentucky lad into an attractive and resourceful man; but its
chief interest lies rather with his trainer. When _Victor McCalloway_
arrived in Kentucky and took _Boone Wellver_ under his wing it became
obvious enough that he was bent on reconstructing his own life as well
as moulding _Boone's_. _McCalloway_, when the seal of his past is broken,
turns out to be _Sir Hector Dinwiddie, D.S.O., K.C.B._, a tradesman's
son who was generally believed to have killed himself in Paris.
I must assume that Mr. CHARLES NEVILLE BUCK intended us to recognise in
_Sir Hector_ a certain General whose name acquired a painful notoriety
not so long ago. The reader may form what opinion he likes of the good
taste of all this, but there can be no question that the author has
drawn a fine character. At the outset his style is so jumpy that the story
is difficult to follow, but presently its course grows clearer and
I fancy that you will follow it keenly, as I did, to the end.

_Peaceful Knight_ (_who has called to ask his way at a strange

TO BE HOME EARLY FOR DINNER."]

STRENUOUS LIFE IN THE WEST.

"At a charity concert at Clifton recently nearly 200 glass tumblers
disappeared in the course of a week."

--_Daily Paper._
Very deplorable, of course.

Still, towards the end of the sixth consecutive day would the audience
be fully responsible

?And I saw the moorhen sitting yester
eve!  And the wild ducklings are out on the pool, and the woods are full
of song.  Oh!  Ambrose!  I never knew how hard it is to part--"

"Nay, now, Steve, where be all your plots for bravery?  You always meant
to seek your fortune--not bide here like an acorn for ever."

"I never thought to be thrust forth the very day of our poor father's
burial, by a shrewish town-bred vixen, and a base narrow-souled--"

"Hist! hist!" said the more prudent Ambrose.

"Let him hear who will!  He cannot do worse for us than he has done!
All the Forest will cry shame on him for a mean-hearted skinflint to
turn his brothers from their home, ere their father and his, be cold in
his grave," cried Stephen, clenching the grass with his hands, in his
passionate sense of wrong.

"That's womanish," said Ambrose.

"Who'll be the woman when the time comes for drawing cold steel?" cried
Stephen, sitting up.

At that moment there came through the porch a man, a few years over
thirty, likewise in mourning, with a paler, sharper countenance than the
brothers, and an uncomfortable pleading expression of self-
justification.

"How now, lads!" he said, "what means this?  You have taken the matter
too hastily.  There was no thought that ye should part till you had some
purpose in view.  Nay, we should be fain for Ambrose to bide on here, so
he would leave his portion for me to deal with, and teach little Will
his primer and accidence.  You are a quiet lad, Ambrose, and can rule
your tongue better than Stephen."

"Thanks, brother John," said Ambrose, somewhat sarcastically, "but where
Stephen goes I go."

"I would--I would have found Stephen a place among the prickers or
rangers, if--" hesitated John.  "In sooth, I would yet do it, if he
would make it up with the housewife."

"My father looked higher for his son than a pricker's office," returned
Ambrose.

"That do I wot," said John, "and therefore, 'tis for his own good that I
would send him forth.  His godfather, our uncle Birkenholt, he will
assuredly provide for him, and set him forth--"

The door of the house was opened, and a shrewish voice cried, "Mr
Birkenholt--here, husband!  You are wanted.  Here's little Kate crying
to have yonder smooth pouch to stroke, and I cannot reach it for her."

"Father set store by that otter-skin pouch, for poor Prince Arthur slew
the otter," cried Stephen.  "Surely, John, you'll not let the babes make
a toy of that?"

John made a helpless gesture, and at a renewed call, went indoors.

"You are right, Ambrose," said Stephen, "this is no place for us.  Why
should we tarry any longer to see everything moiled and set at nought?
I have couched in the forest before, and 'tis summer time."

"Nay," said Ambrose, "we must make up our fardels and have our money in
our pouches before we can depart.  We must tarry the night, and call
John to his reckoning, and so might we set forth early enough in the
morning to lie at Winchester that night and take counsel with our uncle
Birkenholt."

"I would not stop short at Winchester," said Stephen.  "London for me,
where uncle Randall will find us preferment!"

"And what wilt do for Spring!"

"Take him with me, of course!" exclaimed Stephen.  "What! would I leave
him to be kicked and pinched by Will, and hanged belike by Mistress
Maud?"

"I doubt me whether the poor old hound will brook the journey."

"Then I'll carry him!"

Ambrose looked at the big dog as if he thought it would be a serious
undertaking, but he had known and loved Spring as his brother's property
ever since his memory began, and he scarcely felt that they could be
separable for weal or woe.

His quicker intellect and superior refinement made him a model. The
Bulgarian imitated the Greek tongue and Greek manners; he was
willing in other lands to be himself looked on as a Greek. It is
only in quite modern times, under the direct influence of the preaching
of the doctrine of race, that a hard and fast line has been drawn
between Greeks and Bulgarians. That doctrine has cut two ways. It has
given both nations, Greek and Bulgarian alike, a renewed national life,
national strength, national hopes, such as neither of them had felt for
ages.
In so doing, it has done one of the best and most hopeful works of
the age. But in so doing, it has created one of the most dangerous
of immediate political difficulties.He had wedded
the daughter of a person engaged in law business at Southampton, and had
only been an occasional visitor at home, ever after the death of his
stepmother.  She had left these two boys, unwelcome appendages in his
sight.  They had obtained a certain amount of education at Beaulieu
Abbey, where a school was kept, and where Ambrose daily studied, though
for the last few months Stephen had assisted his father in his forest
duties.

Death had come suddenly to break up the household in the early spring of
1515, and John Birkenholt had returned as if to a patrimony, bringing
his wife and children with him.  And, as to the desirableness of
a wider culture than that yielded by science alone, it is to be
recollected that the improvement of manufacturing processes is only one
of the conditions which contribute to the prosperity of industry.It had always been understood that on their father's death the two
younger sons must make their own way in the world; but he had hoped to
live until they were a little older, when he might himself have started
them in life, or expressed his wishes respecting them to their elder
brother.  An Account of the Life, Opinions, and Writings of John Milton.

[2] Review of Lockhart's ScottThere might have been some jealousy excited by the estimation in which
Stephen's efficiency--boy as he was--was evidently held by the plain-
spoken underlings of the verdurer; and this added to Mistress
Birkenholt's dislike to the presence of her husband's half-brothers,
whom she regarded as interlopers without a right to exist.  Matters were
brought to a climax by old Spring's resentment at being roughly teased
by her spoilt children.  He had done nothing worse than growl and show
his teeth, but the town-bred dame had taken alarm, and half in terror,
half in spite, had insisted on his instant execution, since he was too
old to be valuable.  Stephen, who loved the dog only less than he loved
his brother Ambrose, had come to high words with her; and the end of the
altercation had been that she had declared that she would suffer no
great lubbers of the half-blood to devour her children's inheritance,
and teach them ill manners, and that go they must, and that instantly.
John had muttered a little about "not so fast, dame," and "for very
shame," but she had turned on him, and rated him with a violence that
demonstrated who was ruler in the house, and took away all disposition
to tarry long under the new dynasty.

The notions of the beginning and the end of the world entertained by
our forefathers are no longer credible. It is very certain that
the earth is not the chief body in the material universe, and that the
world is not subordinated to man's use. It is even more certain that
nature is the expression of a definite order with which nothing
interferes, and that the chief business of mankind is to learn
that order and govern themselves accordingly. Moreover this scientific
"criticism of life" presents itself to us with different credentials from
any other. It appeals not to authority, nor to what anybody may have
thought or said, but to nature. It admits that all our interpretations
of natural fact are more or less imperfect and symbolic, and bids
the learner seek for truth not among words but among things.The other uncle, Harry Randall, had disappeared from the country under a
cloud connected with the king's deer, leaving behind him the reputation
of a careless, thriftless, jovial fellow, the best company in all the
Forest, and capable of doing every one a work save his own.

The two brothers, who were about seven and six years old at the time of
his flight, had a lively recollection of his charms as a playmate, and
of their mother's grief for him, and refusal to believe any ill of her
Hal.  Rumours had come of his attainment to vague and unknown greatness
at court, under the patronage of the Lord Archbishop of York, which the
Verdurer laughed to scorn, though his wife gave credit to them.  Gifts
had come from time to time, passed through a succession of servants and
officials of the king, such as a coral and silver rosary, a jewelled
bodkin, an agate carved with Saint Catherine, an ivory pouncet box with
a pierced gold coin as the lid; but no letter with them, as indeed Hal
Randall had never been induced to learn to read or write.  It must
soon have been hard to distinguish the Roman colonist in Gaul or
Spain from the native Gaul or Spaniard who had, as far as in him lay,
put on the guise of a Roman. This process of assimilation has gone
on everywhere and at all times. When two nations come in this way
into close contact with one another, it depends on a crowd of
circumstances which shall assimilate the other, or whether they shall
remain distinct without assimilation either way.
