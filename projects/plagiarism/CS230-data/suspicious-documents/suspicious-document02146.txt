PREFACE.

Few men who have written books have been able to win so large a share of
the personal affection of their readers as honest Izaak Walton has done,
and few books are laid down with so genuine a feeling of regret as the
"Complete Angler" certainly is, that they are no longer. "One of the
gentlest and tenderest spirits of the seventeenth century," we all know
his dear old face, with its cheerful, happy, serene look, and we should
all have liked to accompany him on one of those angling excursions from
Tottenham High Cross, and to have listened to the quaint, garrulous,
sportive talk, the outcome of a religion which was like his homely garb,
not too good for every-day wear. We see him, now diligent in his business,
now commemorating the virtues of that cluster of scholars and churchmen
with whose friendship he was favoured in youth, and teaching his young
brother-in-law, Thomas Ken, to walk in their saintly footsteps,--now
busy with his rod and line, or walking and talking with a friend, staying
now and then to quaff an honest glass at a wayside ale-house--leading a
simple, cheerful, blameless life

   "Thro' near a century of pleasant years."[1]

We have said that the reader regrets that Walton should have left so
little behind him: his "Angler" and his Lives are all that is known to
most. But we are now enabled to present those who love his memory with
a collection of fugitive pieces, in verse and prose, extending in date
of composition over a period of fifty years,--beginning with the Elegy
on Donne, in 1633, and terminating only with his death in 1683. All these,
however unambitious, are more or less characteristic of the man, and
impregnated with the same spirit of genial piety that distinguishes the
two well-known books to which they form a supplement.

Walton's devotion to literature must have begun at an early age; for in
a little poem, entitled _The Love of Amos and Laura_, published in 1619,
when he was only twenty-six, and attributed variously to Samuel Purchas,
author of "The Pilgrims," and to Samuel Page, we find the following
dedication to him:--

    "TO MY APPROVED AND MUCH RESPECTED FRIEND, IZ. WA.

    "To thee, thou more then thrice beloved friend,
    I too unworthy of so great a blisse:
    These harsh-tun'd lines I here to thee commend,
    Thou being cause it is now as it is:
      For hadst thou held thy tongue, by silence might
      These have beene buried in obliuious night.

    "If they were pleasing, I would call them thine,
    And disauow my title to the verse:
    But being bad, I needes must call them mine.
    No ill thing can be cloathed in thy verse.
      Accept them then, and where I have offended,
      Rase thou it out, and let it be amended.

                                              "S.P." [2]

What poems Walton wrote in his youth, we have now no means of knowing; it
has not been discovered that any have been printed, unless we adopt the
theory advocated by Mr. Singer,[3] and by a writer in the "Retrospective
Review,"[4] that the poem of _Thealma and Clearchus_, which he published
in the last year of his life, as a posthumous fragment of his relation
John Chalkhill, was really a juvenile work of his own. Some plausibility
is lent to this notion by the fact that Walton speaks of the author with
so much reticence and reserve in his preface to the volume, and also that
in introducing two of Chalkhill's songs into the "Complete Angler," he
does not bestow on them the customary words of commendation. This theory
has been rebutted by others, who assert that Walton was of too truthful
and guileless a nature to resort to such an artifice. We confess that we
are unable to see anything dishonest in the adoption, as a pseudonym, of
the name of a deceased friend, or anything more than Walton appears to
have done on another occasion when he published his two letters on "Love
and Truth." It is certain, however, that a family of Chalkhills existed,
with whom Walton was closely connected by his marriage with the sister of
Bishop Ken. But that an "acquaintant and friend of Edmund Spenser,"
capable of writing such a poem as _Thealma and Clearchus_, should have
kept his talents so concealed, that in an age of commendatory verses no
slightest contemporary record of him exists--is, to say the least,
extraordinary. There are cogent arguments then on both sides of the
question, and there is very little positive proof on either: so we must
be content to leave the matter in some doubt and obscurity.

The first production to which our author attached the well-known
signature of "Iz. Wa." was an Elegy on the Death of Dr. Donne, the Dean
of St. Paul's, prefixed to a collection of Donne's Poems. Walton was then
forty years of age. From this time forward we find him more or less
engaged, at not very long intervals, on literary labours, till the very
year of his death.

The care which Walton spent on his productions seems to have been very
great. He wrote and re-wrote, corrected, amended, rescinded, and added.
This very poem--the Elegy on Donne--he completely remodelled in his old
age, when he inserted it in the collection of his Lives. But we have
thought it well to give the original version here as a literary curiosity,
and the first work of his that has come down to us. The original Lives
themselves--especially those of Wotton and Donne--were mere sketches of
what they are in their present enlarged form.

Walton had the good fortune to be thrown very early in life into the
society and intimacy of men who were his superiors in rank and education.
But he had enough of culture, joined to his inherent reverence of mind,
to appreciate and understand all that they had and he wanted.

The preface to Sir John Skeffington's _Heroe of Lorenzo_ had for two
centuries lain forgotten, and escaped the notice of Walton's biographers,
till in 1852 it was discovered by Dr. Bliss of Oxford, and communicated by
him to the late William Pickering.

The original Spanish work was first published in 1630. The author's real
name was not Lorenzo, but Balthazar Gracian, a Jesuit of Aragon, who
flourished during the first half of the seventeenth century, when the
cultivated style took possession of Spanish prose, and rose to its
greatest consideration.[5] It is a collection of short, wise apothegms
and maxims for the conduct of life, sometimes illustrated by stories of
valour, or prowess, or magnanimity, of the old Castilian heroes who figure
in "Count Lucanor." The book, though now no longer read, must have been
very popular at one time, for there exist two or three later English
versions of it, without, however, the nervous concentration of style and
idiomatic diction that characterize the translation sent forth to the
world under Walton's auspices.

The two Letters published in 1680 under the title of Love and Truth,[6]
were written respectively in the years 1668 and 1679. The evidence of
their authorship is twofold, and we think quite conclusive. In one of the
very few copies known to exist, and now in the library of Emanuel College,
Cambridge, its original possessor, Archbishop Sancroft, has written:--"Is.
Walton's 2 letters conc. ye Distemp's of ye Times, 1680," and Dr. Zouch
appended to his reprint of the tract[7] a number of parallel passages
from other acknowledged writings of Walton, of themselves almost
sufficient to fix the question on internal evidence alone.

In the British Museum copy of this tract is the following note on one of
the fly-leaves in the autograph of the late William Pickering:--

  "The present is the only copy I have met with after twenty years'
  search, excepting the one in Emanuel College, Cambridge. W. Pickering."

The copy described above [_i.e._, the Emanuel College copy] appears to
be the same edition as the present [that now in the British Museum], but
has the following variation. After the title-page is printed

                    The Author to the Stationer

"Mr. Brome," &c., and the Epistle ends with "Your friend," without the
N.N. which is found in this copy. But what is more remarkable, the printed
word Author is run through, and corrected with a pen, and over it written
_Publisher_, which is evidently in the handwriting of Walton. So Mr.
Pickering further certifies.

The following allusion towards the bottom of p. 37 confirms the idea of
Walton's authorship. Speaking of Hugh Peters and John Lilbourn, the writer
says:--"Their turbulent lives and uncomfortable deaths are not I hope yet
worn out of the memory of many. He that compares them with the holy life
and happy death of Mr. George Herbert, as it is plainly and _I hope truly_
writ by Mr. Isaac Walton, may in it find a perfect pattern for an humble
and devout Christian to imitate," &c.

The following are the chief parallel passages in this pamphlet and in
Walton's other writings, as indicated by Zouch:--


 _Second Letter_, _p. 19._                 _Life of George Herbert._

I wish as heartily as you                 Mr. George Herbert having

so lovingly-simple, as to suffer          to claim a precedence of any

they proclaim their own Ambition,
and their Husbands folly.

And I say the like, concerning
their _striving for Precedency_.


       _P. 20._                            _Life of George Herbert._

And, I confess also, what                 One cure for the wickedness

people in the Christian World.

To the present Editor the collection and annotation of these Remains has
been a most welcome labour of love. Some of his oldest and most cherished
memories connect themselves with the author of the "Complete Angler." That
book was one of the first that he ever read with real and genuine delight;
and even before reading days commenced, in the earliest dawn of memory,
the place where Walton had cut his familiar signature of "Iz. Wa." on
Chaucer's tomb in Westminster Abbey, was pointed out to him often by a
kindred spirit now here no more. The name of Walton will also be found
enshrined in the earliest prose production[8] to which the Editor
prefixed his own name.

    least. A fortnight ago I had no idea that I should so soon be here.

I knew that I could not stay much longer at the Pension Clissot,
and naturally wondered what instructions Madame Delclos would receive
from Lady Chillington as to my disposal.

The last time I saw her ladyship, her words seemed to imply that, after
    my education should be finished, I should have to trust to my own
exertions for earning a livelihood.

In fact, I have looked upon myself all along as ultimately destined
    to add one more unit to the great tribe of governesses."
    "Such a fate shall not be yours if my weak arm has power to avert
    it," said Sister Agnes.

                         "For the present
      your services are required at Deepley Walls, in the capacity
    of 'companion' to Lady Chillington--in brief, to occupy the position
held by me for so many years, but from which I am now obliged to
secede on account of ill-health."

    Janet was almost too astounded to speak.
    

      "Companion to Lady Chillington! I! Impossible!" was all
    that she could say.

"Why impossible, dear Janet?"

asked Sister Agnes, with her low, sweet voice.

       "I see no element of impossibility in such an arrangement.

            The duties of the position have been filled by me for many years;
they have now devolved upon you, and I am not aware of anything
that need preclude your acceptance of them."

                      "We are not all angels like you, Sister Agnes," said Janet.

"Lady Chillington, as I remember, is a very peculiar woman. She has no
regard for the feelings of others, especially when those others are her
inferiors in position. She says the most cruel things she can
think of and cares nothing how deeply they may wound.

I am afraid that she and I would never agree."
"That Lady Chillington is a very peculiar woman I am quite ready to
admit.

That she will say things to you that may seem hard and cruel, and that
may wound your feelings, I will also allow.

But granting all this, I can deduce from it no reason why the
position should be refused by you.

  
  And wonder not; for, when a generall losse
  Falls on a nation, and they slight the crosse,
  God hath rais'd Prophets to awaken them
  From stupifaction; witnesse my milde pen,

  Thou art not onely dull, but hast a curse
  Of black ingratitude; if not, couldst thou
  Part with _miraculous Donne_, and make no vow
  For thee, and thine, successively to pay
  A sad remembrance to his dying day?
    Did his youth scatter _Poetry_, wherein
  Was all Philosophy? was every sinne,
  Character'd in his _Satyrs_? Made so foule
  That some have fear'd their shapes, and kept their soule
  Safer by reading verse? Did he give _dayes_
  Past marble monuments, to those, whose praise
  He would perpetuate? Did he (I feare
  The dull will doubt:) these at his twentieth year?
    But, more matur'd; Did his full soule conceive,
  And in harmonious-holy-numbers weave
  A [2]_Crown of sacred sonnets_, fit to adorne
  A dying Martyrs brow: or, to be worne
  On that blest head of _Mary Magdalen_,
  After she wip'd Christs feet, but not till then?
  Did hee (fit for such penitents as shee
  And he to use) leave us a _Litany_,
  Which all devout men love, and sure, it shall,
  As times grow better, grow more classicall?
  Did he write _Hymnes_, for piety, for wit,[3]
  Equall to those, great grave _Prudentius_ writ?
  Spake he all _Languages_? knew he all Lawes?
  The grounds and use of _Physick_; but because
  'Twas mercenary, wav'd it? Went to see
  That blessed place of _Christs nativity_?
  Did he returne and preach him? preach him so
  As since S. _Paul_ none did, none could? Those know,
  (Such as were blest to heare him) this is truth.[4]
  Did he confirm thy aged?[5] convert thy youth?
  Did he these wonders? And is this deare losse
  Mourn'd by so few? (few for so great a crosse.)

  To be Close Mourners at his Funerall;

  To'inlarge the Soule from these walls, mud and clay,
  (Materials of this body) to remaine
  With _Donne_ in heaven, where no promiscuous pain
  Lessens the joy we have, for, with _him_, all
  Are satisfy'd with _joyes essentiall_.
    Dwell on this joy my thoughts; oh, doe not call[6]
  Griefe back, by thinking of his Funerall;
  Forget hee lov'd mee; Waste not my sad yeares;
  (Which hast to _Davids_ seventy,) fill'd with feares
  And sorrow for his death; Forget his parts,
  Which finde a living grave in good mens hearts;
  And, (for, my first is dayly payd for sinne)
  Forget to pay my second sigh for him:
  Forget his powerfull preaching; and forget
  I am his _Convert_. Oh my frailty! let
  My flesh be no more heard, it will obtrude
  This lethargy: so should my gratitude,
  My flowes[7] of gratitude should so be broke;
  Which can no more be, than _Donnes_ vertues spoke
  By any but himselfe; for which cause, I
  Write no _Encomium_, but this _Elegie_,[8]
  Which, as a free-will-offring, I here give
  Fame, and the world, and parting with it grieve
  I want abilities, fit to set forth
  A monument, great, as Donnes matchlesse worth.

_On a Portrait of_ DONNE _taken in his eighteenth year._

  This was for youth, Strength, Mirth, and wit that Time
  Most count their golden Age; but t'was not thine.
  I came down very late to breakfast this
  morning--my first breakfast in the country is
  always luxuriously late--and I found a tall and
  pretty young girl busy building up the fire
    in my sitting-room. I guessed at once she was
    the "Annie" of whom I heard a long and pleasing account
                                                        last night.

       Annie is the image of what her mother must have been twenty years
ago.

         She has the same agreeable blue
             eyes, the same soft
                    straw coloured hair.

                      But while Mrs.

Anderson wears hers in bands at each side of the head, Annie's is drawn
straight back to display the smoothest of white foreheads, the freshest of

          PREFACE TO QUARLES'S SHEPHERD
                     ORACLES.

                      1645.

_To the Reader._

READER,
Though the Authour had some years before his lamented death, compos'd,
review'd, and corrected these Eglogues; yet, he left no Epistle to the
Reader, but onely a Title, and a blanke leafe for that purpose.

Whether he meant some Allegoricall exposition of the Shepheards names, or
their Eglogues, is doubtfull: but 'tis certain, that as they are, they
appear a perfect pattern of the Authour; whose person, and minde, were
both lovely, and his conversation such as distill'd pleasure, knowledge,
and vertue, into his friends and acquaintance.

'Tis confest, these Eglogues are not so wholly divine as many of his
publisht Meditations, which speak _his affections to be set upon things
that are above_, and yet even such men have their intermitted howres, and
(as their company gives occasion) commixtures of heavenly and earthly
thoughts.

You are therefore requested to fancy him cast by fortune into the company
of some yet unknown Shepheards: and you have a liberty to beleeve 'twas
by this following accident.

"He in a Sommers morning (about that howre when the great eye of Heaven
first opens it selfe to give light to us mortals) walking a gentle pace
towards a Brook (whose Spring-head was not far distant from his peacefull
habitation) fitted with Angle, Lines, and Flyes: Flyes proper for that
season (being the fruitfull Month of _May_;) intending all diligence to
beguile the timorous Trout, (with which that watry element abounded)
observ'd a more then common concourse of Shepheards, all bending their
unwearied steps towards a pleasant Meadow within his present prospect,
and had his eyes made more happy to behold the two fair Shepheardesses
_Amaryllis_ and _Aminta_ strewing the foot-paths with Lillies, and
Ladysmocks, so newly gathered by their fair hands, that they yet smelt
more sweet then the morning, and immediately met (attended with _Clora
Clorinda_, and many other Wood-nymphs) the fair and vertuous _Parthenia_:
who after a courteous salutation and inquiry of his intended Journey,
told him the neighbour-Shepheards of that part of Arcadia had dedicated
that day to be kept holy to the honour of their great God _Pan_; and,
that they had designed her Mistresse of a Love-feast, which was to be
kept that present day, in an Arbour built that morning, for that purpose;
she told him also, that _Orpheus_ would bee there, and bring his Harp,
_Pan_ his Pipe, and _Titerus_ his Oaten-reed, to make musick at this
feast; shee therefore perswaded him, not to lose, but change that dayes
pleasure; before he could return an answer they were unawares entred into
a living mooving Lane, made of Shepheard and Pilgrimes; who had that
morning measured many miles to be eye-witnesses of that days pleasure;
this Lane led them into a large Arbour, whose wals were made of the
yeelding Willow, and smooth Beech boughs: and covered over with Sycamore
leaves, and Honysuccles."

I might now tell in what manner (after her first entrance into this Arbour)
_Philoclea_ (_Philoclea_ the fair _Arcadian_ Shepheardesse) crown'd her
Temples with a Garland, with what flowers, and by whom 'twas made; I might
tell what guests (besides _Astrea_ and _Adonis_) were at this feast; and
who (beside _Mercury_) waited at the Table, this I might tell: but may not,
cannot expresse what musick the Gods and Wood-nymphs made within; and the
Linits, Larks, and Nightingales about this Arbour, during this holy day:
which began in harmlesse mirth, and (for _Bacchus_ and his gang were
absent) ended in love and peace, which _Pan_ (for he onely can doe it)
continue in _Arcadia, and restore to the disturbed Island of_ Britannia,
_and grant that each honest Shepheard may again sit under his own Vine and
Fig-tree, and feed his own flock, and with love enjoy the fruits of peace,
and be more thankfull._

Reader, at this time and place, the Authour contracted a friendship with
certain single-hearted Shepheards: with whom (as he return'd from his
River-recreations) he often rested himselfe, and whilest in the calm
evening their flocks fed about them, heard that discourse, which (with the
Shepheards names) is presented in these Eglogues.

"What name?" cried Mrs. Moffit sharply, turning over rapidly the leaves
of a ledger.
"Miss West. If you remember, I--"
"Oh, yes, child, my memory's good enough," was the tart interruption.
"But with so many applicants it's impossible to be at any certainty

  Heaven was in him, before he was in heaven.

Since Bookes seeme by custome to Challenge a dedication, Justice would
not allow, that what either was, or concern'd Sir Henry Wotton, should be
appropriated to any other Persons; Not only for that nearnesse of Aliance

by a title of that intirenesse of Affection, which was in you to each

And since yours was a Friendship made up of generous Principles, as I
cannot doubt but these indeavours to preserve his Memory wil be acceptable

_On the Death of my dear Friend Mr. William Cartwright, relating to the
foregoing Elegies._


    I cannot keep my purpose, but must give
    Sorrow and Verse their way; nor will I grieve
    Longer in silence; no, that poor, poor part
    Of natures legacy, Verse void of Art,
    And undissembled teares, CARTWRIGHT shall have
    Fixt on his Hearse; and wept into his grave.
      Muses I need you not; for, Grief and I
    Can in your absence weave an Elegy:
    Which we will do; and often inter-weave
    Sad Looks, and Sighs; the ground-work must receive
    Such Characters, or be adjudg'd unfit
    For my Friends shroud; others have shew'd their Wit,
    Learning, and Language fitly; for these be
    Debts due to his great Merits: but for me,
    My aymes are like my self, humble and low,
    Too mean to speak his praise, too mean to show
    The World what it hath lost in losing thee,
    Whose Words and Deeds were perfect Harmony.
      "Still, to please you, I will take my macintosh,"
    said H.C.; "it is hanging up in the hall."
    But the macintosh had disappeared. A traveller
    who had left by the last train had
      good-naturedly appropriated it to his own use and service.be as thou wast below,
    A more than common instrument to show
    Thy Makers praise; sing on, whilst I lament
    Thy loss, and court a holy discontent,
    With such pure thoughts as thine, to dwell with me,
    Then I may hope to live, and dye like thee,
    To live belov'd, dye mourn'd, thus in my grave;
    Blessings that Kings have wish'd, but cannot have.

        PREFACE TO SIR JOHN SKEFFINGTON'S
                HEROE OF LORENZO.

                      1652.


[The Heroe, of Lorenzo, or, The way to Eminencie and Perfection. A piece
of serious Spanish wit Originally in that language written, and in English.
By Sir John Skeffington, Kt. and Barronet. London, printed for John Martin
and James Allestrye at the Bell in St Pauls Church-yard. 1652.]


_Let this be told the Reader_,

That Sir _John Skeffington_ (one of his late Majesties servants, and a
stranger to no language of _Christendom_) did about 40 years now past,
bring this Hero out of Spain into England.

There they two kept company together 'till about 12 months now past: and
then, in a retyrement of that learned knights (by reason of a sequestration
for his masters cause) a friend coming to visit him, they fell accidentally
into a discourse of the _wit_ and _galantry_ of the _Spanish Nation_.
