28  They who are great, cannot
subsist without those that are little;
nor the little without the great;

29  But there must be a mixture
in all things, and then there will
be use and profit too.

30  Let us, for example, take
our body: the head without the
feet is nothing, neither the feet
without the head.

31  And even the smallest members
of our body are yet both necessary
and useful to the whole body.

32  But all conspire together,
and are subject to one common
use, namely, the preservation of
the whole body.

33 Let therefore our whole body
by saved in Christ Jesus; and let
everyone be subject to his neighbour,
according to the order in which
he is placed by the gift of God.

34  Let not the strong man despise
the weak; and let the weak see that
he reverence the strong.

35  Let the rich man distribute
to the necessity of the poor; and
let the poor bless God, that he has
given one unto him, by whom his
want may be supplied.

36  Let the wise man show forth
his wisdom, not in words, but in
good works.

37  Let him that is humble, not
bear witness to himself, but let
him leave it to another to bear
witness of him.

38  Let him that is pure in the
flesh, not grow proud of it, knowing
that it was from another that he
received the gift of continence.

39  Let us consider therefore,
brethren, whereof we are made;
who, and what kind of men we
came into the world, as it were
out of a sepulchre, and from outer
darkness.

40  He hath made us, and formed
us, brought us into his own world;
having presented us with his
benefits, even before we were born.

41  Wherefore, having received
all these things from him, we
ought in everything to give thanks
unto him, to whom be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.


CHAPTER XVIII.

     Clement therefore exhorts them to do everything
     orderly in the Church, as the only way to please God.

FOOLISH and unwise men, who
have neither prudence, nor
learning, may mock and deride
us; being willing to setup
themselves in their own conceits.

2  But what can a mortal man
do? Or what strength is there in
him that is made out of the dust?

3  For it is written, there was no
shape before mine eyes; only I
heard a sound and a voice.

4  For what? Shall  man be pure
before the Lord? Shall he be
blameless in his works?

5  Behold, he trusteth not in
his servants; and his angels he
chargeth with folly.

6  Yes, the heaven is not clean
in his sight, how much less they
that dwell in houses of clay; of
which also we ourselves were
made?

7  He smote them as a moth:
and from morning even unto the
evening they endure not. Because
they were not able to help
themselves, they perished;
he breathed upon them and they
died, because they had no wisdom.

8  Call now if there be any that
will answer thee; and to which of
the angels wilt thou look?

9  For wrath killeth the foolish
man, and envy slayeth him that is
in error.

10  I have seen the foolish taking
root, but lo, their habitation was
presently consumed.

11  Their children were far from
safety, they perished at the gates
of those who were lesser than
themselves: and there was no man
to help them.

12  For what was prepared for
them, the righteous did eat; and
they shall not be delivered from
evil.

13  Seeing then these things are
manifest unto us, it will behove
us to take care that looking into
the depths of the divine knowledge,
we do all things in order,
whatsoever our Lord has commanded
us to do.

14  And particularly that we
perform our offerings and service to
God, at their appointed seasons
for these he has commanded to be
done, not rashly and disorderly,
but at certain determinate times
and hours.

15  And therefore he has ordained
by his supreme will and authority,
both where, and by what persons,
they are to be performed; that
so all things being piously done
unto all well-pleasing, they
may be acceptable unto him.

16  They therefore who make
their offerings at the appointed
seasons, are happy and accepted;
because through obeying the
commandments of the Lord,
they are free from sin.

17  And the same care must be
had of the persons that minister
unto him.

18  For the chief-priest has his
proper services; and to the priest
their proper place is appointed;
and to the Levites appertain their
proper ministries; and the layman
is confined within the bounds of
what is commanded to laymen.

19  Let every one of you therefore,
brethren, bless God in his proper
station, with a good conscience,
and with all gravity, not exceeding
the rule of his service that is
appointed to him.

20  The daily sacrifices are not
offered everywhere; nor the peace-
offerings, nor the sacrifices
appointed for sins and transgressions;
but only at Jerusalem: nor in any
place there, but only at the altar
before the temple; that which is
offered being first diligently
examined by the high-priest and
the other minister we before
mentioned.

21  They therefore who do any
thing which is not agreeable to his
will, are punished with death.

22  Consider, brethren, that by
how much the better knowledge
God has vouchsafed unto us, by so
much the greater danger are we
exposed to.


CHAPTER XIX.

     The orders of Ministers in Christ's Church established
     by the Apostles, according to Christ's command,
     7 after the example of Moses.
     16 Therefore they who have been duly placed in the
     ministry according to their order, cannot without
     great sin be put out of it.

THE Apostles have preached to
us from the Lord Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ from God.

2  Christ therefore was sent by
God, the Apostles by Christ; so
both were orderly sent, according
to the will of God.

3  For having received their
command, and being thoroughly
assured by the resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and convinced
by the word of God, with the
fulness of the Holy Spirit, they
went abroad, publishing, That the
kingdom of God was at hand.

4  And thus preaching through
countries and cities, they appointed
the first fruits of their conversion
to be bishops and ministers over
such as should afterwards believe,
having first proved them by the
Spirit.

5  Nor was this any new thing;
seeing that long before it was
written concerning bishops and
deacons.

6  For thus saith the Scripture,
in a certain place; I will appoint
their overseers in righteousness,
and their ministers in faith.

7  And what wonder if they, to
whom such a work was committed
by God in Christ, established such
officers as we before mentioned;
when even that blessed and faithful
servant in all his house, Moses,
set down in the Holy Scriptures
all things that were commanded
him.

8  Whom also all the rest of the
prophets followed, bearing witness
with one consent to those things
that were appointed by him.

9  For he, perceiving an emulation
to arise among the tribes concerning
the priesthood, and that there was
a strife about it, which of them
should be adorned with that glorious
name; commanded their twelve captains
to bring to him twelve rods; every
tribe being written upon its rod,
according to its name,

10  And he took them and bound
them together, and sealed them
with the seals of the twelve princes
of the tribes: and laid them up in
the tabernacle of witness, upon
the table of God.

11  And when he had shut the
door of the tabernacle, he sealed
up the keys of it, in like manner
as he had done the rods; and said
unto them, Men and brethren,
whichsoever tribe shall have its
rod blossom, that tribe has God
chosen to perform the office of a
priest, and to minister unto him
in holy things.

12  And when the morning was
come, he called together all Israel,
six hundred thousand men; and
showed to the princes their seals
and opened the tabernacle of
witness; and brought forth the
rods.

13  And the rod of Aaron was
found not only to have blossomed,
but also to have fruit upon it.

14  What think you, beloved?
Did not Moses before know what
should happen?

15  Yes verily: but to the end
there might be no division, nor
tumult in Israel, he did in this
manner, that the name of the true
and only God might be glorified;
to whom be honour for ever and
ever, Amen.

16  So likewise our Apostles
knew by our Lord Jesus Christ,
that there should contentions arise,
upon account of the ministry.

17  And therefore having a perfect
fore-knowledge of this, they
appointed persons, as we have
before said, and then a gave
direction, how, when they should
die, other chosen and approved men
should succeed in their ministry.

18  Wherefore we cannot think
that those may justly be thrown
out of their ministry, who were
either appointed by them, or
afterwards chosen by other eminent
men, with the consent of the whole
church; and who have with all
lowliness and innocency ministered
to the flock of Church, in peace,
and without self-interest, and
were for a long time commended
by all.

19  For it would be no small sin
in us, should we cast off those
from their ministry, who holily
and without blame fulfil the
duties of it.

20  Blessed are those priests,
who having finished their course
before these times, have obtained
a fruitful and perfect dissolution
for they have no fear, lest any one
should turn them out of the place
which is now appointed for them.

21  But we see how you have
put out some, who lived reputably
among you, from the ministry,
which by their innocence they had
adorned.


CHAPTER XX.

     He exerts them to peace from examples out of
     the Holy Scriptures,
     20 particularly from St. Paul's exhortation to them.

YE are contentious, brethren,
and zealous for things that
pertain not unto salvation.

2  Look into the Holy Scriptures,
which are the true words of the
Holy Ghost. Ye know that there
is nothing unjust or counterfeit
written in them.

3  There you shall not find that
righteous men were ever cast off
by such as were good themselves.

4  They were persecuted, but it
was by the wicked and unjust.

5  They were cast into prison,
but they were cast in by those that
were unholy.

6  They were stoned, but it was
by transgressors.

7  They were killed, but by accursed
men, and such as had taken up an
unjust envy against them.

8  And all these things they
underwent gloriously.

9  For what shall we say,
brethren? Was Daniel cast into the
den of lions, by men fearing
God? Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, were they cast into the
fiery furnace by men, professing
the excellent and glorious worship
of the Most High? God forbid.

10  What kind of persons then
were they that did these things?
They were men abominable, full
of all wickedness; who were
incensed; to so great a degree,
as to bring those into sufferings,
who with a holy and unblameable
purpose of mind worshipped God:
not knowing that the Most High is
the protector and defender of all
such as with a pure conscience
serve his holy name: to whom be
glory for ever and ever, Amen.

11  But they who with a full
persuasion have endured these
things, are made partakers of glory
and honour: and are exalted and
lifted up by God for a memorial
throughout all ages, Amen.

12 Wherefore it will behove
us also, brethren, to follow such
examples as these; for it is
written, Hold fast to such as are
holy; for they that do so shall be
sanctified.

13  And again in another place
he saith, With the pure, thou shalt
be pure (and with the elect thou
shalt be elect,) but with, the
perverse man thou shalt be perverse.

14  Let us therefore join ourselves
to the innocent and righteous; for
such are the elect of God.

15  Wherefore are there strifes,
and anger, and divisions, and
schisms, and wars, among us?
