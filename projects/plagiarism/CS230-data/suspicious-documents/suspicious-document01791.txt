CLASSIC MYTHS

with drawings entirely from classic sources


PREFACE


The very cordial reception given this little book by teachers and
children, both in school and out of school, has tempted me carefully to
revise the stories, omitting some and adding others, in the hope of
making the book still more welcome and more helpful. The illustrations
in the present edition are all from classic sources, and reproduce for
the reader something of the classic idea and the classic art.

The book was originally prepared as an aid in Nature Study, and this
thought has been retained in the present edition. By reading these myths
the child will gain in interest and sympathy for the life of beast,
bird, and tree; he will learn to recognize those constellations which
have been as friends to the wise men of many ages. Such an acquaintance
will broaden the child's life and make him see more quickly the true,
the good, and the beautiful in the world about him.

HOW THE HORSES OF THE SUN RAN AWAY

_Greek_


Phaeton was the child of the Sun-god, Apollo.

"Mother Clymene," said the boy one day, "I am going to visit my
father's palace."

"It is well," she answered. "The land where the Sun rises is not far
from this. Go and ask a gift from him."

That night Phaeton bound his sandals more tightly, and, wrapping a
thicker silken robe about him, started for the land of Sunrise,
sometimes called India by mankind.

Many nights and many days he traveled, but his sandals never wore out
nor did his robe make him too hot or too cold.

At last, as he climbed the highest mountain peak of all the earth, he
saw the glittering columns of his father's palace. As he came nearer he
found that they were covered with millions of precious stones and inlaid
with gold. When he started to climb the numberless stairs, the silver
doors of the palace flew open, and he saw the wonderful ivory ceiling
and the walls of the long hall.

He was glad that the steps were many and he looked long at the pictures
carved on the walls by an immortal artist.

There were pictures of both land and sea. On the right was earth with
its towns, forests, and rivers, and the beings that live in each. On the
left was the ocean with its mermaids sporting among the waves, riding on
the backs of fishes, or sitting on the rocks drying their sea-green
hair. Their faces were alike, yet not alike, as sisters ought to be.

Up, up the hundreds of steps he climbed, never wearied. On the ceiling
of this marvelous hall he could see carved the stars of heaven. On the
silver doors were the twelve strange beings of the sky, formed of stars;
six on each door.

The last step was reached. Outside the sky was dark, but at the doorway
Phaeton stopped, for the light from his father was more than he could
bear. There sat Apollo, dressed in crimson, on a throne which glittered
with diamonds. On his right hand and on his left stood the Days, bright
with hope; and the Months, hand in hand with the Days, seemed listening
to what the Years were whispering to them.

Phaeton saw there the four seasons. Spring, young and lovely, came
first, her head crowned with flowers. Next came Summer, with her robe of
roses thrown loosely about her and a garland of ripe wheat upon her
head. Then came merry Autumn, his feet stained with grape juice; and
last, icy Winter, with frosty beard and hair, and Phaeton shivered as he
looked at him. Dazzled by the light, and startled to find himself in
such a presence, he stood still.

The Sun, seeing him with the eye that sees everything, asked:

"Why are you here?"

"Apollo, my father, grant me one request, that I may prove to mortals
that you are my father."

Apollo laid aside his dazzling crown of rays, clasped Phaeton in his
arms and said:

"Brave son, ask what you will, the gift is yours."

Quicker than a flash from his father's crown came the question
from Phaeton:

"Will you let me for one day drive your chariot?"

Foolish father, foolish son! Apollo shook his head three times in
warning.

"I have spoken rashly. This one thing no mortal can achieve. Nor can any
immortal save myself hold in the horses that draw the fiery car of day.
It is not honor, but death you ask. Change your wish."

Phaeton answered:

"My mother taught me that my father always kept his promises."

"It is even so, rash boy. If you do not change, neither can I. Bring the
chariot of the Sun."

The daring child stood beside the glorious car that was higher than
his head. His eyes flashed bright as the diamonds that studded the
back of the golden chariot. The golden axle gleamed through the silver
spokes, for the chariot was made of naught but gold and silver and
precious stones.

Then Early Dawn threw open the purple doors of the eastern sky. The
stars, answering the signal of the Day Star, slowly passed from sight,
followed by their marshal.

The Hours obeyed Apollo's orders, and, harnessing the horses, led out
the wondrous creatures and fastened them to the chariot.

Apollo bathed Phaeton's face with ointment, and taking up the crown of
shining rays, fastened it on the rash boy's head.

With a sigh, he said:

"My son, you will at least take my advice in one thing: spare the whip
and hold tight the lines. You will see the marks of the wheels where I
have gone before, and they will guide. Go not too high or you will burn
the heavens, nor too low or you will set your mother's home, the earth,
on fire. The middle course is best. Take the reins, or, if even now you
will change your wish, abide here, and yield the car to me."

Phaeton leaped into the golden chariot, and with a proud smile thanked
his father. Then he gave the word to the horses.

They darted forward through the morning clouds with the fury of a
tempest. Men on the earth thought it was noonday and tried to do double
their daily work. The fiery horses soon found their load was light, and
that the hands on the reins were frail. They dashed aside from their
path, until the fierce heat made the Great and the Little Bear long to
plunge into the sea.

Poor Phaeton, looking down on the earth, grew pale and shook with
terror. He wished that he had never seen these shining steeds, had never
sought the palace of the Sun, and that he had never held his father to
that rash promise.

Diana, who drives the chariot of the Moon, heard the mad racket in the
sky, and shooting her arrows at the frightened horses, turned them aside
in time to prevent them from dashing her own silver car to pieces.

Earth cried for clouds and rain. The people of Africa became black
because of the terrible heat. Streams dried up, mountains burned, and
the River Nile hid his head forever in a desert. At last Earth cried in
a husky voice to Jupiter, the ruler of the gods:

"What have I done that this punishment should come? Slay me, or save my
people from this burning!"

[Illustration: PHAETON FALLING FROM THE CHARIOT]

Jupiter, from his seat in the thunderclouds, saw the danger the
heavens and the earth were in, and hurled his lightnings at the rash
driver. Phaeton fell dead from the chariot. From morning till night,
and from that night till morning, he fell like a shooting star, and
sank at last into an Italian river. His sisters trembled so at his
fall and wept so bitterly that they changed into poplar trees upon the
river banks. Even to this day they mourn for him and tremble at the
least breeze from heaven. Apollo's horses, calmed by Jupiter's voice,
finally found the track. When evening came they entered the western
gates of the sky and were taken back, by way of the north, to their
stalls near Apollo's palace.


WODEN, GOD OF THE NORTHERN SKY

_Norse_


Little Hilda Peterson sat by a table in her mother's room studying her
spelling lesson. Suddenly she startled her mother by giving the table a
sharp rap with her pencil and saying:

"What a queer name for a day! Why didn't the people who named the days
give them numbers instead of names? I can never remember how to spell
Wednesday. What is the use of the third letter in it?"

"My little girl, when you have finished your lesson I will tell you a
story; then I think you will always remember where the fourth day got
its name."

It did not take Hilda many minutes to finish her studying, with the
promise of a story before her.

This is the old Norse tale her mother told:

"Long years ago, before our fatherland, Norway, became a Christian
country, our people were taught that they must worship many gods. Nearly
all of these they feared; a very few they loved. The greatest was Woden.
When little children looked at the moon and stars, they were told that
Woden made them. When they asked about the clouds, everyone said, 'Woden
made them.'

[Illustration: WODEN]

"In the spring they were told that Woden made the leaves come and the
flowers open. No one knew the true God then. Everyone said that Woden
lived in a beautiful city in the sky, north of our own Northland. All
the houses there were gold and silver, and the most splendid one was
Woden's royal palace. This was called Valhalla. To reach it one had to
ride or walk the whole length of the rainbow, as it arched from land to
land. But there was a sharp-eyed watchman at the gate who stopped anyone
who had no right to cross that seven-hued bridge.

"In Valhalla, Woden's people were always happy. They were never sick;
they never died. There were no little girls and no little boys in this
golden palace, only soldiers; and some of these were women! Woden
often sent his shield-maidens, as they were called, to battlefields to
carry to Valhalla the souls of brave men. The first portion of King

King Henry. From Worry shaken and pale haggard sorrow, we finally
find the Augenblik, where the geschrekte Peace again Athem can
come to aborted Accente of new work to talk to distant shores to
our Muth employ.

No longer will this earth the blood of their own children to drink, no
longer domestic discord devastate their fields, and with the If the
war iron flourishing Auen mash. rükende battle against these orders, which
equals the meteors scenting a sky, all of einerley nature of einerley

are now gleichlauffenden lines , in a beautiful line of policy, a
way out, no longer be brothers against brothers, friends against
friends are, no longer the mördrische steel, übeleingescheideten
like a knife, wounding his own Lord.

No, my friends, to that sacred grave of Christ, under whose heilbringendem
Creuze we have vowed to fight, we want to war with our English army, in
order that those infidels from the holy lands to drive, what the blessed
feet are gone, the front of one hundred fourteen years for our
salvation to the bittre Creuze have been nailed.

However, this is our project already a year old, it is unnöthig you to
say that we want to go, and we are not IZO For this came together. Let
me hear from you, my beloved cousin of Westmorland, which is our
Rathscheck Assembly yesterday for undertaking this important
agreement. Westmorland. Gracious Lord, we operate this business
with great zeal, and there were various flashovers of expenses
designed: As a quite unverhofter Courier, laden with irksome newspapers,
came in between, of which the worst was that the noble Mortimer, of the
people of Hereford-Schire agitate against Glendower led by Welschen caught,
and over a thousand of his people niedergemezelt been seyen , in
whose bodies the women Todt Welschen of such abuse, such a beastly
schaamlose Verstümmlung exercised without Erröthen can not tell.

King Henry. It seems, then, the news of this uprising have developed
our business in accordance with the promised land aborted? Westmorland.
This even more support, thats it, Gracious Lord, because there were still
more unequal and mißbeliebige newspapers from north.

On the cross-raising day geriethen this muthreiche hot track, the
young Henry Percy, and Archibald, this glorious tapfre and bulkheads,
to Holmedon into a bloody Handgemeng, so much learned from the
institutions and the fury of the attack was close, because the person
who of this newspaper took, ran in the middle of the strongest Hize
of battle like this, without waiting for the outcome. King
Henry. Here is a Werther-zealous and faithful friend, Sir Walter
Blunt, who just dismounted from his horse, to us from Holmedon
willkommne the message to that of the Earl of Douglas beaten sey.

Ten thousand bold Scots, and three and twenty knights Sir Walter looked
at the leveling of Holmedon in their blood roll. Mordak, Earl of Fife,
the eldest son of geschlagnen Douglas and the Earl of Athol,
Murry, Angus, and Menteith has hot track get caught. Is not that a
nice booty? A noble That? Ha, cousin, is it not? Westmorland. In That a
victory, what a prince proud to have Seyn cause.

King Henry.

O why you mention the word, sad thoughts in order to excite me, and
me to the sin of envy to irritate that Milord Northumberland the
father of a son so worthy Seyn aims, one son, whose name the glory
always goes in the mouth, the same the highest tree in a Hayn,
towers over all others, the favorite of the Glüks, and her pride,
however, that I use just the Blik, the looks on his fame, shame and
rampant Schwelgerey the forehead of my young Harry besmirch see.

O you can 'it be proved that any night fairy mincing our children
in the cradle confused, and my son, Percy, Plantagenet genennt those
with him would have - But let me, this idea is not to hang on -
what do you think cousin of this young Percy pride?

It keeps the prisoners, which he did in this battle for the back, and
let me say that I am not as Mordake, the Earl of Fife, to have.

Westmorland. The inspiration is his uncle, this is Worcester, Apparently
after all the evil-minded is against you, the ists that him inflate
his feathers, and his young comb against your Highness emporsträuben
makes.

King Henry. I voted for him geschikte to him deßwegen to account,
and that is the cause why we are genöthigt our holy defer projects

Vetter, we want to next Wednesday for our big Rath gather in Windsor.

Benachrichtiget of which the Lords, but eilet quickly back to us, then
there must be more to be said and done, as our reluctance to say IZT
allowed. Westmorland. I obey, area of my Lord. (They go from.)

about moving may wish, and what he believed would be heard. Lebet well,
however, ye shall me in East Cheap find. (Falstaff's up.) Pointed. Well,

Seyn if they have the prey, and her and I do not abjagen them, so

Prinz Heinrich. But how shall we come by them, if we are riding with them?
pointed. How? We want to before or after them, and to give them a certain
Plaz determine where we want to meet, and then we can miss when
it's our favorite, and then they will Abentheuer alone company, and
once they are done, like we have them.

Prinz Heinrich.

Well, but it is probably that they remind us of our horses on our
clothes, and to hundreds of others milling Saved recognize. pointed. For
this is already Rath shop. Our horses will not see them, because we
want to connect in the forest, our visors, we want to confuse others when
we are away from them, and, Sapperment!

I have Ueberröke of the Vorrath Schetter, under which no one should know
our clothes. Prinz Heinrich.

ahead of Orion. He still follows them, and his dog Sirius, who carries
the famous dog star, is close at his side; but the Pleiads never allow
Orion to overtake them in their long journey through the regions of the
sky. The Pleiads are so beautiful that you must learn to find them, and
this cluster of six twinkling stars, "a swarm of fireflies tangled in a
silver braid," will guide you in finding the belt of the mighty hunter
Orion, the giant of the heavens. Four other very brilliant stars mark
his shoulders and his knees.


THE GREAT BEAR IN THE SKY

_Greek_


"Oh mother, what do you think? Last night that English boy, Charlie
Thornton, asked me if I knew where Charles' Wain was, and when I said I
didn't know, what do you suppose he showed me? Why, nothing but the Big
Dipper up there among the stars. I told him he was mistaken and that
nobody ever called it the odd name he had for it. But he said his mother
called it that, and he wouldn't give it up. Wasn't that queer?"

"Why, no, Ralph, I don't think it was strange that he called it as his
mother had taught him. That is exactly what you do. Many English people
call it Charles' Wain. Wain means wagon, and it does look a little like
a cart or wagon."

"I don't think it does, not the least bit. It looks just like a big
dipper, and like nothing else."

"Why, you silly boy! What would you think if I should tell you that ever
so many people call it the Great Bear?"

"Why, that is queerer yet. Can you see a bear up there in the sky? Maybe
when it thunders it is the Great Bear growling!" and Ralph jumped off
the porch and rolled on the grass, laughing at his discovery.

[Illustration: THE GREAT BEAR IN THE SKY]

In a moment a thought seemed to come to him, and springing up, he ran to
his mother's chair on the porch and said: "Mother, is there any story
about the Great Bear? How did it get up there among the stars? Is the
North Star the Bear's eye? Does his nose always point to the North Star,
the same as the two pointers in the Big Dipper?"

"Now, my boy, you will be surprised again when I tell you that there are
two bears in the sky, the Great Bear and the Little Bear. The wonderful
North Star is in the tip of the tail of the Little Bear."

"Now, I know there is a story about them, just as there was about those
three beautiful ones you showed me in Orion's belt. You told me about
Orion, now you will tell me about the two bears, won't you?"

"It is a sad story, Ralph, and you know you don't like sad stories. But
I will tell it to you, and sometime, in the years to come, you may read
it in a language that is as old as the story.

"Near a beautiful city on the other side of the world was a large
forest. The trees in this forest were very tall, and their branches so
thick that they made a roof over the ground below. One could wander for
miles and miles in the shade of this forest and never find a house, or
any living creatures but the birds and wild animals.

"Once on a time some hunters came back, after having been gone many
days, and said that away in the heart of the forest they had had a
glimpse of a beautiful snow-white bear. Not one of them had been able
to get a shot at it with his arrows, and some thought it was only a
dream. The story spread throughout the city, and all the boys and young
hunters were anxious for a chance to win so fine a prize as the
snow-white skin. Not for himself, oh, no, for whoever brought it home
must hang it in the temple.

"One brave young hunter said, 'I am going into the heart of the forest.
I will take only the bravest with me, and I will never return without
the prize.'

"This young man was dearly loved by everyone. His mother had left him
when he was only a few years old, and gone, no one knew where. He was
cared for by his uncle, and grew up, hoping each year his mother would
return. He took long journeys trying to learn if she were still alive,
but no one could ever tell him a word about her. These journeys had made
him very bold and brave, and there was no cave so dark, nor mountain so
high, but that he would search it in the hope of finding his mother.

"He found six young hunters ready to go with him into the heart of the
forest. They looked very fine in their bright, shining hunting-suits,
with their bows and arrows, and every one wished them success.

"They wasted no time in the pleasant fields outside, but started for the
dark, sunless forest. It was slow work picking their way through the
tangled bushes growing under the trees, and it took many days to reach
the place described by the hunters who had told them the story of the
strange white bear.

"'Whoever sees it first must call to the others. It may be that this is
enchanted ground, and something dreadful will happen to the one who is
alone,' said the leader of the hunting party.

"'It is well said,' they all agreed. In the heart of this wild forest
they wandered, shooting the strange birds they saw there, and saving the
long feathers and wings, to bring home after the hunt was over.

"One day the leader of the hunt chased a wonderful bird for hours from
tree to tree, riding beneath the branches, trying to get a shot.

"At last, just as he had his arrow in his bow, ready to aim, his horse
reared and nearly threw him backward to the ground. There, beside him,
stood the snow-white bear.

"Its two fore paws were stretched out to meet him, and its eyes seemed
full of the love he used to see in his mother's eyes. It was a beautiful
sight, and the arrow meant for the bird shot upward into the sky,
harming no one, but bearing the next words of the hunter as a message to
the great Jupiter.

"'O, my mother, let me live forever with you!' exclaimed the hunter, as
his strong arms were clasped about the white bear's neck.

"'My mother is found!' he shouted, and Echo repeated over and over,
'Found! Found!' until the six fellow hunters came to where the mother
and her son were standing, gazing with loving eyes toward Mount Olympus,
the home of their gods.

"The winged arrow had taken its flight to Jupiter and the son's prayer
was answered.

[Illustration: THE GREAT BEAR AND THE LITTLE BEAR. From an old wood cut.]

"Jupiter's lightnings flashed and the six hunters saw their strong
leader change into the Great Bear, and gently guide his mother, the
Little Bear, to her home in the sky. He took his place near her, at
Jupiter's command, and now follows wherever she leads. He points forever
to her and to the North Star which she keeps. Those who watch this
unchanging beacon among the stars sometimes remember that the people of
long ago thought that it was placed there to tell them of the unchanging
love of mothers."

"Oh, I knew there was a story. It came out all right at last, and that
takes the sad part away."

Then Ralph whispered, "We know it was only a myth, don't we?"


CASTOR AND POLLUX, THE STARRY TWINS

_Greek_


Among the star pictures in the sky may be found one called Gemini, or
the Twins. The ancient Greeks used to believe that twin brothers named
Castor and Pollux had been really placed in the sky. They once lived in
Sparta; their mother was the lovely Leda, and one of their sisters was
the beautiful Helen, whose capture caused the famous Trojan war.

These brothers were as devoted to each other as twins are said to be,
and one was never seen without the other being near. Their love for
their sisters was very great, and once when Helen was captured by two
noted warriors, these twin brothers of hers found her and brought her
safely back to their mother's house.

[Illustration: CASTOR AND POLLUX]

Castor was very fond of horses. He could tame the wildest one that was
ever caught, and lead it about like a pet dog as soon as his magic touch
had taught its fiery spirit that he was its master. He could ride better
than any one in the kingdom, for no horse had ever thrown him.

Pollux was just as famous in boxing and wrestling. He taught young men
many tricks with the hand and foot, and was the leader in all games.

The two brothers were proud to be allowed to go with the other heroes in
quest of the golden fleece. When the sweet music of Orpheus stilled the
wild storm that arose on the sea and threatened to wreck the Argo, stars
appeared upon the heads of Castor and Pollux, for their great love for
each other was known to the Olympian gods who had sent the storm.

When the curious flames, that sometimes during storms play about the
masts and sails of a ship, were seen on other ships after this voyage
of the Argo, the sailors would always cry out, "See the stars of Castor
and Pollux!"

Their love for each other made them more famous than anything else. When
at last Castor was slain in a great battle, Pollux prayed Jupiter to let
them be again united. The prayer was granted. Not long after this, the
poets tell us, the star picture of the Twins was discovered in the sky,
and there the two loving brothers stay forever watching the earth to see
if they may help others to be faithful to the end.


THE MILKY WAY

_Russian_


Soon after the world was made, God created a beautiful maiden and gave
her charge of all the birds beneath the heavens. Her name was Lindu. Her
father's name was Uko. She knew all the birds of passage, and where they
should go in autumn, and she sent each flock on its way.

Lindu cared for the birds tenderly, like a mother for her children, and
gave them help whenever it was possible. She sent the stormy wind to
blow dust into the eyes of the fierce hunters when they were seeking to
slay her pets. It was not surprising that all the world loved her, and
those who dwelt in the sky most of all.

The North Star wished to make her his wife. He drove up to Uko's palace
with a dusky coach drawn by six black horses, and in the coach were ten
fine presents. But Lindu did not love him.

"You always stay in one place, and cannot stir from it," said she. "Go
back to your watch-tower."

Then came the Moon drawn in a silver coach by ten gray horses, and the
Moon brought twenty presents. But Lindu did not love the Moon.

"You change your face too often and not your path, and that will never
suit me," she said.

So the Moon drove away wearing his saddest face. Scarcely had the Moon
gone before the Sun drove up. He rode in a golden coach drawn by twenty
gold-red horses, and he brought thirty presents with him. But all his
grandeur went for nothing with Lindu, for she said:

"I do not love you. You follow the same track day by day, just like
the Moon. I love the changing seasons, the changing winds, anything
that changes."

At that the gold-red horses leaped away and Lindu was alone with
her birds.

At length the Northern Light came from his home in the midnight land in
a diamond coach drawn by a thousand white horses. He was so grand that
Lindu went to the door to meet him. His servants carried a whole
coach-load of gold and silver, pearls and jewels into her house. She
loved this bright suitor at once.

"You do not travel the same path all the time like the others. You set
out when you wish and rest when it pleases you. Each time you wear a new
robe, and each time you ride in a new coach with new horses. You shall
be my bridegroom."

And Lindu's choice was made.

The news was sent throughout the world, and guests came from the four
sides of the sky and of the earth to greet Lindu and the Northern Light.
It was agreed that the wedding should be when the birds flew south. Back
to his home in the midnight land went the Northern Light, knowing that
Lindu loved him best.

The torrent which fell half a thousand feet over the mountain side sent
Lindu her bridal veil. The Frost King sent her laces so fine that a
breath of summer air would have destroyed them, and they were stored
away in a block of ice for safe keeping. The birds brought her robes of
butterfly wings softer than silk and more beautiful than velvet. Her
sandals were from the wings of the honey bee, stronger than reindeer
skin, and fleeter than a chamois' foot.

Spring passed away. Summer came and went. The birds flew south, and
Lindu waited for the Northern Light's return. Snow sparkled on the
earth, but no hoof-beat of his thousand white horses broke the stillness
of the midnight air. Spring came, but never the Northern Light.

Then Lindu began to weep, and from her tears sprang the little brooks in
the valleys of Earth. The birds flew about her head and rested on her
shoulders. They tried to caress her in a hundred ways, but Lindu did not
heed them. Then they flew away and wandered in strange places, building
nests where no nests were ever seen before. Many an egg was lost and
many a nestling stolen because Lindu was not near to help her birds.

At last Uko heard their sad songs and then saw his daughter's grief.
Uko's heart was always merry and his hands so full of work that he had
not noticed Lindu's trouble. He ordered the Four Winds to lift her
gently and bring her to him in his sky palace.

She dressed herself in her bridal veil, her frosted laces, and robes of
butterfly wings, and the four strong Winds lifted her from the ground.
The song-birds of Earth gathered about her and sang their sweetest
songs. With her white bridal veil streaming far out on the air and a
happy smile on her lips, Lindu sailed across the sky to Uko's palace.
There she lives now, happy as her father Uko. Her white veil spreads
from one end of the heavens to the other, and whoever lifts his eyes to
the Milky Way beholds the maiden in her bridal robes.

From there she directs her birds. From there she waves her white hand in
greeting to the Northern Light as his thousand horses leap through the
sky. She has forgotten his unkindness and her sorrow. The Northern Light
still loves her, but is so changeful that he can never keep a promise.
Uko has given Lindu her station in the heavens and her work. Forever
beautiful and forever young, never changing, she forever smiles at the
changeful Northern Light.


HOW FIRE CAME TO EARTH

_Greek_


Once the earth was but a ball of dead, cold rock and barren sand. Once
the waters were nothing but a mass of icy waves.

Two great giants, Titans the Greeks called them, were given the task of
making the earth what it had been planned to be.

Epimetheus and Prometheus were the names of these giants. Epimetheus
took upon himself the task of making the lower animals and man.
Prometheus overlooked the work and gave hints if he saw that anything
was lacking.

Epimetheus made the fishes. He set them afloat in the water, and taught
them to swim. He made the lion and gave it courage. He gave wings to the
bird and showed it how to fly swiftly through the air. He covered the
crab with its shell and taught it how to creep.

Man came last. Epimetheus had nothing to give him. Claws, wings, shelly
covering, fur, everything had been bestowed on the creatures which he
had made first. Epimetheus saw how weak man was with all the fierce
animals around him. He went to Prometheus for help, and said:

"I have clothed this last creature which I have made with robes from the
garments the immortals have cast aside. The thorns cannot tear him, but
the wild beast can take his life in a moment. Help me to make him
conqueror of everything in earth and sea and sky."

[Illustration: MINERVA]

Prometheus sought Minerva for wisdom. She gave him a golden torch, whose
wood was cut from the pines that grew nearest heaven on the earth's
highest peak, and said:

"Follow what this branch of pine is seeking. It will take and hold the
gift reserved for man."

When Prometheus grasped the torch, it leaped upward through the sky past
the pale, cold moon; past flashing stars; upward, till the torch and its
bearer stood in the high heavens by the burning chariot of the sun.

The pine kissed the leaping flames and a fire was kindled in its own
heart. Prometheus sprang backward from the sun chariot, and, bearing
the flaming torch in his hands, brought down to man, from the sun, the
gift of fire.

No creature but man can possess or use this gift. Man would not part
with it for all the treasures below the earth's surface, nor for all the
gifts that birds, beasts, and fishes can boast.

With fire, weapons are made that can subdue the strongest beast that
ever fought for its life. Tools with which man tills the earth and
blasts the rock are made with the aid of fire. With fire man warms his
dwelling. While the wild creatures shiver in the ice and snow man makes
summer within the four walls of his home.

Man walks the earth a conqueror, but should the gift of fire be taken
from him, how would he then teach the lower animals that he is their
master? Having this gift he excels all other creatures. Without it he
would be poor indeed.

Go where you will, the gift Prometheus brought is known to the race to
whom it was given. There is no savage so ignorant but that he has the
art of making fire.

Fire gleams from the eyeballs of the beasts when they are in anger, but
this fire is cold compared with the burning blaze of wood and coal.

No beast will attack mankind when protected by a blazing torch. The gift
of Prometheus shows the wisdom of Minerva.


BEYOND THE FIRE ISLAND

_Russian_


Once there was a man who decided to take a journey to the uttermost end
of the world where it touches the sky. He thought he could reach that
point only by sea, but being tired of the water decided to travel on the
wings of an eagle. A raven told him better, however, for the nights are
months long in the far Northland and the eagle loves the sunlight.

Then this man, who was a king, gave orders to fell the greatest oak tree
in his three kingdoms. Olaf the Brave undertook this task. The oak tree
was very large and neither sun, moon, nor stars could shine between its
leaves, they were so close together. The king commanded that deep-sea
sailing ships should be made from its trunk, warships from its crown,
merchant ships from its branches, children's boats from the splinters,
and maidens' rowing boats from the chips.

But the wise men of Norway and Finland assembled and gave the king
advice. They told him that it was no use building a wooden ship, for the
spirits of the Northern Lights would set it on fire. Then the king made
a ship of silver. The whole of the ship--planking, deck, masts, and
chains--was of silver, and he named his vessel "The Flyer."

Then--for this was ages ago--he provided golden armor for himself,
silver armor for his nobles, iron for the crew, copper for the old men,
and steel for the wise men.

When everything was ready, he and his sailors set out for Finland. But
they soon turned and headed "The Flyer" to the far north. The Great Bear
in the sky guided them.

At the helm of the ship was a wise pilot who knew all languages and
the speech of birds and beasts. The winds of Finland were angry
because he slighted their country, and a great storm arose and blew
the ship out of her course. The birds sang to the helmsman and told
him by their song that his ship was being driven on the bleak and
desolate coast of Lapland.

The king and his bold comrades succeeded in landing in Lapland, but
could find no people. At last a sailor discovered a house. In it
dwelt a wise man and his daughter. The king asked the wise man the
way to the end of the world. The wise man answered that he had asked
a vain question.

"The sea has no end, and those who go westward have found their death in
the Fire Island. Turn homeward and live," said the wise man.

The king only answered by asking the wise Lapp if he would be their
guide to the Fire Island. He consented and went aboard the ship. His
name was Varrak.

He steered the boat due north for thirty days and thirty nights. The
first danger they met was a great whirlpool, whose center was a vast
hole into which had been drawn many a brave ship. Varrak threw overboard
a small barrel wrapped in red cloth and trimmed with many red streamers,
but with a rope attached to it. A whale swallowed this bait and then
tried to escape as he felt the rope pulling him. In his flight he towed
the ship to a safe place in the open sea.

This brought them far westward and at last they came within sight of the
Island of Fire. Iceland, men call it now, but surely it has as much fire
as ice. From the middle of this Iceland they could see great pillars of
flame and vast clouds of smoke ascending into the air.

Varrak warned the king of his danger, but was commanded to run the boat
ashore. Those who explored the land found a vast mountain casting up
flames and another mountain pouring out smoke. Soon the party came
across great spouting fountains of boiling water, and they found the
ground beneath their feet to be burning lava.

The son of Sulev, who was leading this exploring party, wandered through
snow-fields covered with ashes. A shower of red-hot stones warned him
that he was near the volcano. Going too close to this burning mountain,
his hair and eyebrows were singed and his clothing took fire. He rolled
in the snow and saved himself.

Then the son of Sulev thought it best to go back to the ship. Calling
his party together, he found that the youngest, the yellow-haired boy
who was cupbearer to the king, was gone. The birds told the helmsman,
the wise Lapp, that the lad had made friends with the water-sprites
beyond the snow mountains and would never return.

The winds drove the ship about for many days till she grounded again on
a strange shore.

Another party of nobles and sailors went to search this country. Being
tired, they lay down under an ash tree and fell asleep. The people in
this land were giants, and a giant's daughter found them. They were so
very small to the giant child that she picked them up and put them in
her apron, and carried them home to her father.

"Look at these strange creatures, father," she said. "I found them
asleep under a head of cabbage in our garden. What are they?"

The giant knew them to be men from the east. Now the east has always
been noted for its wisdom, so he questioned these men with riddles.

"What walks along the grass, steps on the edge of the fence, and walks
along the sides of the reeds?" he asked.

"The bee," answered the wise man of the party.

"What drinks from the brooks and wells, and from the stones on
the bank?"

"The rainbow," replied the wise man.

Then the giant told his little daughter to put the strangers back
exactly where she had found them. But the wise man asked her to carry
them to the ship just for fun. She leaned over the vessel like a vast
cloud and shook them out of her white apron upon the deck. Then with one
long breath she blew the ship four miles out to sea. The king shouted
back his thanks.

But that wind blew northwest instead of north. The cold was intense and
they watched from midnight to midnight the combats in the air between
the spirits of the Northern Lights. The sailors were frightened, but the
king was pleased. He was farther north than ever before.

The helmsman warned them that they were approaching another shore. No
birds welcomed them or sang them the name of the country. Men dressed in
the skins of dogs and bears met them as they landed, and took them to
their homes on sledges of ice drawn by dogs. Their houses were of blocks
of ice and snow, and their talk sounded like dogs barking.

The king did not like these people, for their land was cold. The wise
man told him again that his search was an idle one. The end of the world
was not for mortal eyes to see. At last the king believed him and sailed
homeward. No man to this day has been able to find the far north, the
end of the world.


A LEGEND OF THE NORTH WIND

_Norse_


North Wind likes a bit of fun as dearly as a boy does, and it is with
boys he likes best to romp and play.

One day North Wind saw a brave little fellow eating his lunch under a
tree. Just as he went to bite his bread, North Wind blew it out of his
hand and swept away everything else that he had brought for his lunch.

"You hateful North Wind!" cried the little fellow. "Give me back my
supper. I'm so hungry."

[Illustration: BOREAS, THE GOD OF THE NORTH WIND]

Now North Wind, like all brave beings, is noble, and so he tried to make
up for the mischief he had done.

"Here, take this tablecloth," said North Wind, "and, in whatever house
you stay, spread it on the table; then wish, and you shall have
everything you wish for to eat."

"All right!" said the boy, and he took the tablecloth and ran as fast as
he could to the first house, which proved to be an inn.

"I have enough to pay for lodging, so I'll stay all night," he said
to himself.

"Bring me a table," he ordered the innkeeper, as he went to his room.

"Ha! ha!" laughed the innkeeper. "You mean bring me a supper."

"No, I don't. I want only a table and that right quick. I'm hungry."

The innkeeper brought the table, but, after the door was shut, he
watched through the keyhole to see what would happen.

"Beans, bread, and bacon," ordered the boy, as he spread out his
tablecloth. On came beans, bread, and bacon through the open window,
whirled in by North Wind. Smoking hot they all were, too, for the dishes
were tightly covered. After supper was over, the boy went sound asleep.

North Wind did not waken him as the innkeeper took the table and the
table-cloth and carried them down-stairs. Next morning the boy was
hungry again, but there was no tablecloth and so no breakfast.

"You are a cheat, North Wind; you have taken back your tablecloth."

[Illustration: TOWER OF THE WINDS AT ATHENS]

"No," said North Wind, "that is not the way I do." But the boy did not
get his tablecloth.

After a time North Wind met him again out under the trees.

"This time I will give you a sheep," he said. "Each time that you rub
his wool, out will drop a gold piece. Take care of him."

The boy ran back and found the sheep at the door of the stable, behind
the inn. He caught the sheep by a strap which was around its neck, and
led it slowly up the stairs of the inn, to the room from which the
tablecloth had disappeared the night before.

As the boy was hungry for his breakfast, he obeyed North Wind's command
and patted the sheep upon its back. A gold piece fell out of its fleece
upon the floor.

"Good old North Wind!" said the boy. "Here's my breakfast and some
hay for my sheep. Come breakfast, come hay," and through the open
window came first a bundle of hay, and then a fine breakfast for the
hungry boy. After breakfast the boy paid for a week's lodging with
the gold piece.

He slept soundly that night with his sheep for his pillow, and the next
night also, but the third morning when the boy awoke, his head lay upon
the floor and the sheep was gone.

Perhaps too many gold pieces had been seen in the boy's hand, for he had
patted his sheep very often.

He accused North Wind again. "You have taken back your sheep. I don't
like you. You are as cold-hearted as you can be."

But North Wind said nothing. He put a queer stick into a bag and
gave it to the boy and told him to go back and lock his door as
tightly as before.

"Talk to the bag," he said, "and guard it as carefully as if there was a
jewel in it."

That night the boy was wakened out of his soundest sleep by screams for
help in his room. There was the innkeeper running about, and that queer
stick was pounding him, first on the head, then on the feet, then on his
back, then in his face.

"Help! help!" he cried.

"Give me back my sheep," said the boy.

"Get it; it is hidden in the barn," said the innkeeper.

The boy went out and found his sheep in the barn and drove it away as
fast as he could, but he forgot about the innkeeper, and, maybe, that
stick is pounding him to this day.


ORPHEUS, THE SOUTH WIND

_Greek_


In the land of Thrace there lived, years ago, one who was called
Orpheus. He was the sweetest singer ever known. His voice was low and
soft.

When men heard this voice all anger ceased, and their thoughts were
thoughts of peace. Even wild animals were tamed.

Orpheus went into the woods one day and took nothing but his harp with
him.

No quiver of arrows was on his back, nor hunting spear at his side.

He sang and sang till the birds flew down on the ground about him, and
seemed to think that a creature with such a voice must be merely another
kind of bird.

[Illustration: ORPHEUS. Showing his broken harp]

A wild cat came creeping slyly between the trees, trying to catch the
little feathered listeners. Orpheus took his lute and played upon it,
and the wild cat became as tame as the birds. They all followed Orpheus
farther into the forest.

Soon, from behind a rock, a tiger sprang to attack the wild cat. The
birds and the wild cat called to Orpheus. When he saw the trouble he
took his harp again, and while he sang the tiger came trembling and
purring to his feet and the birds, the wild cat, and the tiger followed
Orpheus still farther into the forest.

He sat down by a tree to rest and the bees came and showed him where
their honey was hidden in the tree. He fed his friends, and then he and
the tiger led the way to a river where there was the purest water.

Tall trees bent low before him, and young trees tore themselves from the
ground and followed in his train.

Foul waters parted so that Orpheus and his band might pass through
unharmed; they knew no longer any evil thing.

Before they reached the river of pure water, to which the tiger was
leading them, a lion, fierce with anger, sprang madly at his old enemy.
Orpheus took his harp and played so wonderfully that the pine trees
sighed with sorrow, and the lion, loosing his hold on the tiger,
followed the sweet singer of Thrace. At the river the birds, the wild
cat, the tiger, and the lion drank together with Orpheus, with not one
thought of hurting one another.

"We are tired," said the birds. "Let us stay here by this river," and
Orpheus agreed. The birds flew to the trees, while the others tried to
rest on the huge rocks by the shore, but these were jagged and rough.
They would give no rest to any one.

Then Orpheus began to play, and the hardest rocks were stirred. They
rolled over and over into the river, and in their places the softest
beds of white sand were ready for all. Orpheus rested, with the lion and
the tiger for his night-watchers, and the wild cat asleep in the tree
with the birds.

In the morning the harp sounded again, and the strange company wandered
away, happy to be near the music. The three wild beasts fed together on
the river grasses and forgot that they had been life-long enemies.

Orpheus had said, before he came into the wood, that he was tired of men
and their quarrels; that wild beasts were easier to tame than angry men;
and so he found it during these two days in the forest.

He took his harp and played and sang a sweet, wild song of love and
peace, and overhead the leaves and branches of the oaks danced for joy
of living. Not one growl, not one quarrel was heard where even the
echoes of the music went. The very rocks answered the voice of Orpheus,
and everything was at peace.

Then came the sound of the hunting dogs. The lion raised his shaggy
head, but put it down again. Savage light came again into the eyes of
the tiger and of the wild cat. The dogs came nearer. Orpheus played on
his lute and the dogs came and lay down at his feet, and the hunters
went home without their prey.

That night Orpheus led the birds and beasts all back to the places
where he had found them, and went home to live once more in his cave
in Thrace.

For years hunters told, over their camp-fires, strange stories of a
tiger and a lion who lived together in the deep forest; of a wild cat
with eyes like a pet fawn; and of birds whose songs were so sweet that
wild beasts grew tame as they listened.

Sometimes, even in these days, it seems as if Orpheus were
singing again.

When the wind stirs, there comes sweet music. The pine trees sigh, the
leaves and branches of the forest trees dance as in the days when
Orpheus first went into the woods of Thrace.

When the south wind blows, earth's voices become low and sweet, and the
birds sing soft melodies to greet its coming.

Old books tell us that Orpheus was really the south wind itself.


THE LITTLE WIND-GOD

_Greek_


"What is it in the thermometer that shines so, mother?"

"Oh, that is quicksilver, Ethel. See the line of silver run up the tube
while I hold it in my hand."

"Quicksilver? I should think it was quick! See it run back, now the
tube is cool. But father called it something else the other night.
What was it?"

"Oh, yes; he called it mercury, my dear. It is named after one of the
gods the Greeks used to worship, their swift wind-god, Mercury. We read
of him in many old stories. He was so quick that he became a messenger
boy for the other gods."

"Oh, I like those old myths. Tell me about Mercury. I am going to
name my dove after him, for it takes messages for me. Tell me a long
one, please."

"Well, my dear, Mercury is also the name of the planet that will soon be
our evening star. And, Ethel, if I tell you this story now, you must
tell it to me sometime when we watch his beautiful namesake in the sky.
Will you try to remember it?"

"Oh, yes, indeed, I'll remember. I love the stories about the stars. It
makes them seem so real. I know Venus and Jupiter, and Mars with his red
eye, and now I am going to have another friend among them. Oh, I am glad
I asked about that quicksilver," and Ethel settled down on a footstool
at her mother's feet.

This is the story Mrs. Brown told Ethel:

"In the days when the earth was young, a little baby lay alone in its
cradle in a beautiful cave in a mountain side. This baby was Mercury.
His mother had left him because someone had called her away for a
moment, but for some reason she stayed an hour.

"As soon as she had gone, this wee baby turned over, lifted his head,
and, seeing the door of the cave ajar, put out his hand. Touching the
sides of the cradle, he sprang out like a boy ten years old. Slipping
through the doorway, Mercury ran quickly down to the river bank near his
home. A river tortoise was in his way. His tiny toes tripped over it and
he fell. Vexed to be stopped by such a slow, clumsy creature, Mercury
dashed it on a rock and killed it. Then he threw it into the river and
watched the fish feed on its flesh. It seemed but a minute before the
empty shell drifted to his feet. Mercury picked it up and felt sorry for
what he had done.

"'I will make this shell live forever,' he said. 'I do not mean to be
cruel to earth's creatures.'

"Quick as a thought he bored nine holes in each side, and taking the
lacings from his tiny sandals, he split them and strung them into the
holes in the shell.

"Drawing his little hand across the strings, there came the sweetest
sounds, and the first harp on earth was made. He was so pleased that he
hid it under his white dress until he came to some thick reeds by the
river, and there he laid it safely away.

"Running swiftly homeward, he came softly through the narrow opening,
back into his own room, and, creeping into his cradle, he cuddled down
and went to sleep."

"Why, mother, he was so little! Only a baby; how could he?"

"The old myth says he was only three days old when he did this, but
remember, this is like a fairy story, and Mercury was the son of the
great Jupiter. But let me tell the rest. When his mother came back,
she was frightened to think he had been alone an hour, but he was
sleeping so sweetly when she looked at him that she felt he had not
been harmed. The mother never dreamed when she saw the open sandals
that he had been away."

"But the harp, mother; didn't she ever find that?"

"No, you know the little rogue had hidden the harp in the reeds by the
river. Another day he ran away and got into worse trouble than he
expected, for he dared to steal some of Apollo's cattle. They were
beautiful snow-white creatures, feeding in the violet meadows of the
sky. As he saw them drifting slowly toward him, the mischief in him made
him drive these gentle creatures into the sea, and, being tired and
hungry, he tore the last one to pieces and fed on it.

"Though this mischief-maker walked backward to his home, trying to
deceive any who would hunt for him, Apollo found him out. When the
sun-god saw him lying there, a helpless baby in a cradle, Mercury almost
made him think that he had not done the wrong. But at last even
Mercury's mother believed him guilty, for the proofs brought were many,
and Apollo came to take him away. Then the little wind-god took from
under his cradle-clothes the harp which he had hidden there, and
breathed upon it. Apollo was charmed by the melody and could only say:

"'Give me that, and I will not ask for my stolen cattle.'

[Illustration: MERCURY. From a statue in Florence, Italy.]

"That was just what Mercury wished. He quickly handed him the tortoise
shell. In Apollo's hands it made still sweeter music, for everything
Apollo did was best.

"So nimble Mercury was free. When the child was a few months older,
Apollo chose him for his messenger. He gave him a cap with wings at
either side, and winged sandals. In his hands he always carried a winged
wand with two serpents crossed and recrossed upon it. You have surely
seen his picture, Ethel?"

"Oh, yes. Down at the art store there is a little statue of him. I can
remember, this story always."


THE VOICES OF NATURE

_Finnish_


Vanemuine, the god of song, dwelt on the Hill of Taara. But he grew
tired of living in Finland and of his beautiful hill, so he sent word
for all things to come to him to receive the language they were to speak
before he went away to his palace in the sky. As they gathered around
him, he opened his lips and sang so sweetly, so softly, that the murmur
of his harp strings seemed almost harsh as compared with the music of
his rich voice.

The wandering winds who listened afar off caught and remembered only the
loudest tones. The sacred stream that flows so softly around the Hill of
Taara chose for its language the rustling of the silken garments which
moved upon his shoulders as he played.

The listening trees of the forest heard the rushing of his flowing
mantle as he descended from his throne on the crest of the hill; and
ever since, this has been the language of the tree-tops. If one will sit
on the mossy bank of a little brook near by a full-leaved forest, he may
even now fancy that Vanemuine is come again to earth.

Some of the larger creatures took up the deeper tones of the heavy harp
strings, and their language is now full of these sounds. Others loved
the melody of the lighter strings, and this softer music is ever in
their voices.

In his great joy Vanemuine sang songs never before heard on the earth,
and the listening nightingale caught their meaning, never to forget.
When you hear the nightingale pour out its song in the dusk of evening
hours, you hear an echo of the song the nightingale heard upon the
Hill of Taara.

Vanemuine sang of love and of the beautiful springtime. The happy lark
heard and understood, and the sweetest tones of the song she sings over
and over with each returning morning. As she soars higher and higher
into the clear air, she sings her song, trying to tell the whole world
of the love and beauty of which she heard so long ago.

While everything else was being made so happy, the poor fishes were
having a sad time. They could not leave the water to go to the Hill of
Taara, but they stretched their heads out of the brooks and rivers to
their very eyes, yet kept their ears under. So they saw Vanemuine, the
song-god, move his lips, but heard nothing, and they did as he did and
made no sound. To this day the poor, dumb fishes move their lips, but
speak no language.

Only the men and women who stood close around the Hill of Taara
understood everything that was sung. That is why human voices more than
any others can thrill us and make us see the beautiful and true.

Vanemuine sang of the glory of heaven and of the beauty of earth. He
sang of the flowing waters and of the rustling leaves. He sang of the
joys and the sorrows that come to all people, to children and parents,
to the rich and to the poor. If we listen to the songs sung to-day, with
open ears and expectant hearts, we may hear all that Vanemuine sang so
long ago upon the Hill of Taara.

When Vanemuine's songs had been heard by all the world, he rose on the
wings of the winds and went far into cloudland to his golden palace in
the sky. There he still sings his wonderful songs for those who are
greater than mankind.

To this very day the people of Finland think they can sometimes hear
Vanemuine's voice when the forest trees sigh in the wind, or the water
in the river softly laps against its rocky shore. Perhaps--who
knows?--we may hear him, too, if we listen well!


A BAG OF WINDS

_Greek_


"Oh, Grace, do see that man with all those little balloons! Don't they
look like a bunch of big cherries?"

"Yes, they do, Carrie, but cherries are all of one color, and some of
his balloons are red and some are blue. Oh, here is one that has burst.
See, it is only a little rubber sack that was once full of air."

"That makes me think, Carrie, of a story I read the other day about a
bag of winds. It was about the King of the Winds and his kindness. It
was this way:

"Once a man named Ulysses was sailing over a great sea, and he came to
an island. He and his sailors were so tired and hungry that they
stopped for food and rest. The King of the Winds--his name was
Aeolus--was very kind to them, and they feasted for fifteen days; then
they had to go forward on their journey again. King Aeolus thought so
much of Ulysses that he told him that he would see that he had good
sailing weather all the way home, if Ulysses would promise to take
charge of what he would give him.

[Illustration: ULYSSES. Making an offering of wine.]

"King Aeolus went alone to the great cave in the mountains where he kept
the four strong winds and some of the weaker ones. He pounded on the
door with his heavy key to let them know he was there, and that they
must wait his call. Then he unlocked the door and let out the strong
East Wind, but caught the others in a great bag made of a whole ox-hide.
This he tied with a stout cord, and the East Wind took it on his
shoulders and carried it to the boat that was about to sail.

"Then King Aeolus told Ulysses how to fasten it to the mast, and the East
Wind had great frolics with the queer bag in which were his brothers.

"King Aeolus told Ulysses never to sleep unless his faithful watchman was
guarding this treasure. Ulysses thanked him and promised faithfully.
Such beautiful weather had never been known before for so long a time.
The East Wind had no one to quarrel with, and the boat flew like a bird
for nine long days.

"The captain grew weary the tenth night and went to sleep while his
watchman was off duty. That was just the chance the sailors wanted.
Slyly up to the mast crept a strong sailor, thinking he would cut down
this treasure which he thought was gold. As soon as the string snapped,
he found out his mistake, and so did everyone in the boat.

"The mighty North Wind felt the loosening strings and rising from the
corner of the ox-hide bag, into which he had been thrust, rushed past
his brothers and escaped first into the open air. The West Wind came
after, screaming hoarsely, while the South Wind, roused to anger by
such rough treatment, whistled fiercely as his brother, North Wind,
grappled with him. The clouds were twisted into curious shapes as the
winds wrestled above the sea. The strong East Wind strove to drive
back the West Wind, but found that nine days of rest had given his
brother great strength, and the waves rose like mountains under their
feet. For seven hours the winds fought, while the waters were black,
for not one star dared to watch the battle. The boat of Ulysses was
tossed like a seaweed, and the sailors longed for the sunlight that
they might see if the storm had taken anyone from the ship. When the
light came and the fury of the winds grew less, it was found that not
one sailor had been lost; not even the traitor who had cut down the
bag. His punishment was to live.

"The boat drifted back to the land of King Aeolus, and Ulysses begged
for help. 'I cannot help you,' he said. 'You have done this by your
carelessness, and you must now toil at the oars, as before, while I seek
my lost winds.'

"When the winds were tired with their roaming, they came back and were
willing to be led to their cave, but the stout ox-hide bag was lost, and
King Aeolus never made another."


ECHO, THE AIR MAIDEN

_Greek_


"Grace, you should not try to have the last word. It is a bad habit to
get into. Shut your lips and run into another room if you can't stop
yourself by any other means."

"Why, auntie, what a funny way to cure me! But I don't see that I need
any such thing. Johnny was in the wrong and he knows it."

"You see, you are having the last word now. Do you remember what you
heard out by the great rocks the day of the picnic?"

"Oh, that echo! Wasn't it perfect! I said, 'come here,' and it
answered, 'here,' just as plainly as one of the girls, and we talked
with it ever so long."

"Can you call it answering, Grace? Think what it really did."

"Oh, I know now, but I don't like to tell, because--because it seems a
little as you say I do."

"Yes, Grace, and I am going to tell you a story about the very first
echo. Please try to remember it and shut your lips and run away whenever
you feel like having the last word. Will you, dear?"

"I'll remember the story, anyway," said Grace, as she cuddled down on a
footstool at the feet of her aunt.

"This is a sad little story," said her Aunt Kate to her, "and I'm glad
it is only a story.

"The first echo was a pretty girl who had only one fault--she would talk
too much. She not only talked too much and sometimes, I fear, too loud,
but when others tried to say a word, she would begin again and try to
outdo them. She loved to tease and to vex people. Still, she was so
beautiful that no one could bear to punish her.

"One day Queen Juno came down to earth (you see, Grace, this is one of
the old myths) and saucy Echo dared to torment even her. Juno had left
her throne in the sky to search for someone Echo knew.

"'Where is he, Echo?' Juno asked.

"'Is he Echo? Oh, no, I am Echo. Did you want me?' the saucy girl
answered.

"'How dare you do it?' Juno said.

"'Dare you do it? Oh, yes, I dare do anything. Tell me what to do.'

"'You have dared too much already, silly child, and for punishment you
shall lose the use of that tongue of yours, except for the one purpose
of answering back. You shall still have the last word, but never again
shall you speak first.'

"Just then Iris, Juno's maid of honor, came with a shining car drawn by
two peacocks, and away they both went over the rainbow bridge back to
Juno's throne.

"Echo in her sorrow ran and hid herself in a cavern.

[Illustration: From the cover of a drinking cup. Echo is seen in the
branches. Pan is sitting on the rock.]

"She wandered from cave to cave and rock to rock, always answering back
when those who tried to find her called, but never able to tell where
she was. She grew thinner and thinner, till at last nothing was left of
her but her voice.

"That she will always keep, and try as hard as you may, you can never
have the last word with Echo."


IRIS, THE RAINBOW PRINCESS

_Greek_


Queen Juno was the wife of Jupiter, the great king. She lived with her
husband in one of the cloud palaces of the sky, lighted by the moon and
stars at night and the sun by day.

Juno had many followers who were ready to do her bidding, but she loved
best of all her beautiful maid of honor, the princess Iris. No one dared
to use the rainbow but Iris, to whom it had been given by Jupiter.
Whenever Iris was in haste to obey Queen Juno's orders, down from the
palace she would sail in a chariot drawn by two peacocks, and if she
wished she might ride all the way over the rainbow.

[Illustration: IRIS. From an ancient fresco.]

Think of the beautiful Iris, wrapped in a fleecy cloud, gliding over
this wonderful path in the heavens! Wouldn't it have been a lovely
sight to see?

Once Juno sent her all the way to Dreamland to bring to Halcyone,
the daughter of Aeolus, a dream of her husband, who was far away on
the ocean.

Iris loved to help poor mortals, and tears filled her eyes when she
heard how this lonely woman longed to see the one she loved so well.

The clouds caught the tears from the eyes of Iris, and quickly made
ready for her the glorious rainbow bridge, reaching from Dreamland to
the wonderful Garden of the Gods.

She wrapped herself in a cloud chosen from the sunset and, stepping into
her chariot, gave the signal to her birds and drove swiftly down, down
to the dim country of the King of Sleep.

Before she could reach the entrance to his palace, she had to drive
through field after field of poppies, red as the sunset she had just
left in the sky, for poppies give sleep to the people of Dreamland.

Somnus, the King of Sleep, lived in a deep, still cave, so dark that he
had never seen the rainbow or the sun. There was no gate; soft black
plumes and curtains served as doors. Here in the heart of Dreamland Iris
saw all about her strange, beautiful dreams.

There were dreams for children of toys and candies and plays; dreams for
men and women of all that they had ever wished for; dreams, dreams,
everywhere. But Iris did not like darkness any better than you and I do,
and she quickly gave an order for the King of Sleep to send the best
dream possible to the anxious Halcyone. Then back she drove over the
rainbow bridge, up, up to the bright palace in the clouds.

[Illustration: THE HEAD OF IRIS. From a frieze on the Parthenon.]

As soon as she had left the rainbow's track it faded away, but, even
before it was out of sight, a dream of her husband had come to Halcyone,
and Iris was happy.

Iris loved the water best of all things on earth. She always wore a
chain of raindrops for pearls, and a cloud for a robe. She had an army
of soldiers by each river bank. Men called the soldiers plants, but
their swords were always drawn for Iris, and their stately heads were
adorned with her favorite colors.

When you see a group of plants clustered at the water's edge, with their
sword-like leaves pointing to the sky, and their great blue flowers
looking like a crown, remember that is the flower Iris loved.


THE THUNDER-GOD AND HIS BROTHER

_Norse_


Tiu, Ziu, or Tyr, were three names for one of Woden's sons. Tiu was
the brother of Thor, and his mother, Frigga, was always proud of his
courage in war and of his skill and strength in battle. The soldiers
of the Northland cried to him for help as often as they did to his
father, Woden.

Tiu's sign was a sword, and the brave old kings of Norway and their
followers used to engrave his name upon their bright steel blades that
they might please the great warrior who lived in Asgard. It was
thought that if Tiu saw his name written in the strange Runic letters
he would give his help to the man who honored that name and keep his
good sword sharp.

Thor and Tiu went, in the olden time, to the house of a giant to secure
a large kettle which was in the giant's house.

Thor's goats drew with magic swiftness the chariot in which the two
rode, and Thor and Tiu arrived at the house in a few moments.

The giant's wife hid the two huge visitors under one of the many
caldrons she had in her kitchen. When her husband came he broke all the
kettles but one by just glancing at them. He welcomed his visitors in a
very grim way and ordered them to be seated at the table with him. Thor
ate so much that the giant grew angry, but Thor told him he would repay
all by bringing him fish from the sea the next day.

Thor caught two whales and carried them to the giant's house, as he had
promised. The giant laughingly said that he would give him one of the
kettles if he could carry it. Tin tried twice and failed, but Thor,
putting on his magic belt, lifted the kettle and set it on his head
like a cap.

Then the goats took the two sons of Woden back to their home in Asgard.

If anyone should tell you that the giant was winter, and his kettles the
strangely shaped icebergs of the arctic North, would you believe it?
Thor was the god of thunder riding in the clouds with his brother, the
god of bravery and of the strong winds.

Tiu's name has been given to the day before Woden's day, and when
Tuesday comes, try to be as true, brave, and swift as Tiu, the
son of Woden.


NEPTUNE, KING OF THE SEAS

_Greek_


"Mother, when papa came back from South America, he told us a queer
story about the sailors dressing up in masks. What holiday was it? And
what did they do it for?"

"That must have been, Charlie, when the ship crossed the line, or the
equator, as you call it in the geography class. I remember his telling
about King Neptune and his trident."

[Illustration: NEPTUNE]

"What did the sailors do, mother?"

"Why, one dressed to represent Neptune, a famous ocean god, and the rest
masked as his followers. They were given presents by the passengers on
the ship, and it was a grand holiday."

"But who is King Neptune, and where does this ocean god live, mother?"

"People used to believe that Neptune was really king of all the waters
on the earth, Charlie. Doesn't that seem strange? I'll tell you a story
that I heard about Neptune and some of the other gods whom the Greeks
used to worship. Perhaps you will find more stories about him sometime."

"Wait a minute, mother, till I get that easy chair for you. Now we are
ready to begin."

"Once on a time, Juno, the wife of Jupiter, while watching from the sky,
saw some ships on the sea beneath her.

"After looking closely, she found they were the seven ships of Aeneas,
who was trying to reach the land of Italy and was now only a few miles
from its shore.

"Juno, for reasons of her own, did not want Aeneas to reach the land.
Knowing something must be done in the shortest possible time she went to
King Aeolus and asked his help. She promised him all manner of beautiful
gifts if he would only send his winds against the ships of Aeneas.

"King Aeolus knew he was doing wrong, but he would not refuse Juno. He
went to the mountain cave where he kept the storm winds, and, taking his
heavy war spear, burst open the massive door of the cavern and let all
the mad crew out at once.

"The storm they made was terrible. Great waves like mountains came
sweeping over the land, carrying trees and everything away.

"The ships of Aeneas were only playthings in such a hurricane, and the
winds seemed to know for what they had been let loose.

"The great cables that fastened heavy anchors to the ships were snapped
like stalks of corn. The winds roared like wild animals. The sky was as
black as night, and great waterspouts went whirling by like huge tops
set spinning by the blasts.

"One fierce wind blew against the ship of Aeneas and overturned it.

"A whirlwind caught three other ships and tossed them lightly on the
great rocks, on the shore. Another whirlwind sent three more ships into
the terrible quicksands and they were swallowed up.

"Aeneas, swimming in the water, saw around him his trusty sailors
clinging, like himself, to broken planks and pieces of timber. All about
them floated concave shields, outspread mantles, and overturned helmets.
Treasures, too, in the shape of precious home gifts, and robes covered
with jewels, drifted past them.

"But the only thing anyone wanted then was life, and it seemed as if the
winds and waters were ready and able to destroy every man of them.

"Aeneas called to Neptune, king of the seas, and Neptune heard him and
came riding up out of the bottom of the ocean.

"He held his golden-maned horses firmly in check, while his voice roared
over the waters, asking:

"'What is this, you winds, that you dare to trouble earth and sky
without leave from me? Who let you free from your rock prison?'

"The waves were afraid and quieted down. The clouds scattered like
naughty children caught in mischief. The winds flew home and, hurrying
back into their cave, blew the door tight-shut with a bang. Then
everybody waited to see what King Neptune would do.

"He ordered some of his ocean train to pry the three ships off the
rocks, but they could not, and he had to help them with his trident, or
three-pointed spear. Then King Neptune opened the quicksands and the
other three ships sailed out on the water again.

"Neptune knew Aeneas was a brave man and always quick to answer a call
for help, so the boat of Aeneas had been taken care of first, and he and
his men were put back safely into it.

[Illustration: A GREEK COIN. Made about 510 B.C. representing Neptune,
or Poseidon, as the Greeks called him]

"King Neptune, seeing everything was quiet again, showed Aeneas a
beautiful harbor where he and his sailors could rest. The brazen-hoofed
steeds that drew Neptune's chariot were tossing their heads and growing
restive. So Neptune called his followers, and in a flash they all
disappeared into the depths of the sea.

"Jupiter, ruler of the sky, praised Neptune for his skill in checking
the furious winds and maddened waves, and Pluto, ruler of the center of
the earth, said he was proud to call him brother."

"Well, that must have made King Aeolus ashamed of himself. Don't you
think so, mother?"


WHY RIVERS HAVE GOLDEN SANDS

_Greek_


Once a poor peasant named Gordius thought he would give himself and his
family a holiday in the city. He had no horses, but his yoke of oxen
could draw the heavy wagon very well. He fastened them to his cart and,
putting in his wife and boy, climbed in himself.

When near the city, the capital of Phrygia, he thought it would look
better for him to walk and drive his oxen. This he did. As he approached
the city he heard a great noise in the marketplace. He hurried his oxen
to find out what it was all about. He had to jump into his wagon to
avoid the crowd that was following him, and so drove to a great oak in
the public square.

Such a welcome as this poor countryman had!

"Here comes our king!" was the cry from everyone. "We were told he
should come this day in a wagon drawn by oxen, and here he is!"

Gordius could not believe what he heard. But the chief men brought the
crown and put it on his head and declared him king, and he agreed to do
his best to deserve the honor.

The oak near which he had stopped was in front of a temple. Gordius gave
away his oxen and, taking a heavy rope, tied his wagon with a tremendous
knot to the oak. The priest came out and declared that whoever in times
to come should be able to untie that knot would be king of all Asia. No
one ever did untie it. But Alexander the Great came to Phrygia many
years after and, failing to untie it, he took his sword and dealt the
rope such a blow that one stroke cut through the magic knot.

A short time after he left Phrygia all Asia owned Alexander the Great as
king, and maybe that was the way the knot was to be undone. Anyway, he
did not give it up, and that is a good thing for us to remember. Cut the
Gordian knots if they will not be untied.

The little boy who rode in the wagon with Gordius was Midas. After his
father Gordius died, Midas was chosen King of Phrygia. He was kind and
just to the people, as Gordius must have been, or they would not have
chosen his son Midas to be their king.

[Illustration: Silenus Holding Bacchus. From a statue in Rome]

One day while Midas was king some peasants found an old man wandering
about in the woods. The forest was strange to him and he had lost his
way. Midas knew him as soon as the peasants had brought him to the
king's palace. It was Silenus, a teacher whose fame had gone through all
the world. Midas treated Silenus with the greatest respect. For ten days
there was feasting and games in the palace in honor of Silenus. On the
eleventh day Midas took him back to the house of his greatest pupil.
This pupil was more than mortal, so the story goes. His name was
Bacchus. Midas told him all about the finding of Silenus, and Silenus
told all about the pleasant time he had at the king's palace. Then the
wonderful Bacchus told Midas he might have anything he should wish for
as a reward.

Now Gordius, his father, had always wished for more money, though he had
been made king and there was more gold for him and his good queen to
spend than you would think he could manage. Midas, too, had wished for
money. Yet all his life, since that lucky wagon ride, Midas had seen
riches and jewels enough to make him grow tired of such things. But, no;
when Bacchus asked him what he would have, Midas said, "Let everything I
touch turn into gold."

If you had been there and could have had your choice, what would you
have wished for? Can you tell? Never wish for anything quite so foolish
as King Midas did, for see what trouble it made him.

After making the wish, King Midas leaped into his chariot to return
home. As soon as his feet touched the chariot floor, it turned into
solid gold. The reins in his hands became gold. He returned to his
palace and the people thought it must be Apollo come to earth,
everything was so glorious. His wife met him in the palace halls. One
touch and she was turned into a golden statue. No help, no rescue! Midas
went out into his garden and reached for the fruit that hung on the
trees. Nothing but gold after he had touched it. Gold, gold, gold! How
he hated the sight of it! His food and drink were gold. His friends, his
home, even his pillow was cold hard gold.

In a few hours he raised his arms, glittering with cloth of gold,
in prayer, beseeching Bacchus to take his gift away. Bacchus was
kind and said:

"Go to the river Pactolus, find its fountain head, plunge in, and when
your body is covered your fault will be washed away."

Poor King Midas did just as he was told. When he touched the water the
strange power went into the river. The river sands changed into gold,
and to this day grains of gold are found by the river Pactolus.

After that, Midas lived in the country and dressed as plainly as the
poorest peasant. He was so thankful to be free from his terrible gift
that he never wanted anyone to remind him of the time when everything
he touched turned to gold. But even in the country, the yellow plums,
pears, and apples reminded Midas of the fruit he had touched in his
own garden.

In autumn, when golden leaves are falling everywhere and the grain is
waving in the field, one may fancy King Midas is in our own land.


OLD GRASSHOPPER GRAY

_Greek_


  "O, grasshopper, grasshopper gray,
  Give me molasses and then hop away."


That is what Bessie Allen said to the little creature she held between
her thumb and fingers. Did you ever say that rhyme? I should not wonder
if you had said it an hundred times.

The grasshopper in Bessie's fingers seemed very ready to give her brown
molasses from his little mouth and then she let him hop away while she
went to catch another. She did not want that molasses; all she wanted
was the fun of catching the little "hoppity-hops," as she sometimes
called them.

"Come, catch me! I'm a hopper," called her five-year-old brother Willie.
And she saw the little fellow hopping through the grass.

Bessie had so much fun trying to catch this new "grasshopper gray," that
she forgot all about the little creatures she had been pinching.

At last she had her arms around her brother Willie.

"Now you are caught," she said. "Give me some molasses."

And then they both laughed so hard that their mother heard as she came
to the door to look for them.

That night their mother said to their father:

"I have a new name for Willie."

"What is it?" asked their father.

"Tithonus," said their mother.

[Illustration: AURORA, THE GODDESS OF THE DAWN. From a painting on an
old vase.]

"When I was in school one of my lessons was about the beautiful goddess
Aurora. She was said to open the rosy gates of dawn with her own
fingers, so that the wonderful horses of Apollo might pass through to
follow their shining track through the sky. She was so beautiful that
Tithonus, who lived on the earth, always watched for the sunrise, that
he might see Aurora. After a while she began to watch for him, too. She
looked down every morning on the wakening world and found that he was
almost the only one among mortals who enjoyed the glorious colors Apollo
painted in the sky with his arrows of light. One morning she dared to
sing to him, and then he answered that it was Aurora, and not Apollo,
for whom he was watching each morning at sunrise. She loved him for this
and became his wife.

"Being a goddess, she could live for ever, and she wanted Tithonus to
live forever, too. The gods and goddesses never drink wine or water, but
ambrosia from golden goblets. She brought a golden goblet of ambrosia to
Tithonus on the earth, and, after he had taken a drink, told him the
happy news that now he should live forever. But she had forgotten to ask
of the gods for him the gift of eternal youth.

"For many years they loved each other dearly. Then Aurora saw that
Tithonus was growing into a little old man.

"When he was one hundred years old he was shrunken to the size of a
boy of ten.

"When he was two hundred years old he was no larger than a baby, only he
was very lively, and could run as fast as a man.

"When he was three hundred years old Aurora could scarcely find him,
save as his song told her where he was. With his head bent down to the
ground he did not look like a man, and he made his home by the dusty
roadside. But every sunrise he sat upon the tallest spear of grass he
could find and chirped to Aurora as she opened the gates of dawn for
Apollo. After years and years Aurora forgot all about the little gray
grasshopper, but I don't think Tithonus has forgotten her, for he and
all his grasshopper friends chirp the same song as when he first came to
live among them."

"Poor old Tithonus!" said Bessie.

"Why, no," said her father; "mother said he could never die. Maybe it
was Tithonus who gave you molasses to-day. Yes, perhaps that was
ambrosia instead of molasses that the gray grasshopper dropped from
his lips."

"Oh, don't tell any more!" laughed both Willie and Bessie. "We won't
catch another grasshopper."


WHERE THE FROGS CAME FROM

_Roman_


You see the sun every bright day, don't you?

And you see the moon every moonshiny night.

Now, listen, and I'll tell you a story about their mother. No, not about
their mother, but about the mother of the god of the sun, and of the
goddess of the moon, whose names were Apollo and Diana.

It is about Apollo's and Diana's mother this story is to be.

Once when they were little twin babies their mother was in great
trouble. She had to wander around and around, and get food and drink
wherever she could find them.

One day she went to a pond for water, for the people in the houses were
cross and would not give her any.

And just think of it! These people, careless about soiling their green
coats and white vests, ran down to the pond ahead of her, jumped in and
stirred the water so that it was black with mud.

And they called out, "Come and drink, Latona! Come and drink water, pure
and sweet, Latona!"

[Illustration: LATONA. Fleeing with her children]

This the cruel people did until Latona and her babies were so tired and
thirsty they could wait no longer.

"Why do you abuse us?" she said; "you have plenty of water in
your wells. Can you not see how these poor babies reach out their
hands to you?"

But the rude people were jealous of the beautiful woman and her lovely
twins, and only stirred the water till it was blacker, and cried the
more, until they were fairly hoarse:

"Come and drink! Come and drink!"

Latona put her two babies down on the warm grass. Then she looked
straight into the blue sky, and raising her hands said:

"May you never quit that pond in all your lives, neither you nor your
children!"

The story is that Jupiter heard her, and that these cruel people never
came out of the water again. They grew very small; their green coats and
white vests turned into skin, and their children wear to-day the same
kind of suits their parents wore that day they waded into the pool.
Though they have the whole pond to themselves, they croak away until
their mouths have grown wide and ugly, as mockingly as did their
forefathers at Latona.

"Come and drink!" But who wants to drink out of a frog pond?

Little heathen boys, who believed this story, used to pelt frogs with
stones, and there are some boys now who act just like those foolish
little heathen.


THE BIRDS WITH ARROW FEATHERS

_Greek_


There is an old story that tells how a man named Jason went on a long
journey in search of a golden fleece.

He fitted up a great boat, and the bravest and strongest men of his
country offered to go with him.

[Illustration: JASON. Putting on his sandals. From a Greek statue.]

They had no ships like ours, in those days, and when the sails were not
filled with wind, every man took an oar, and, with twenty oars or more
on each side, the boat was made to move through the waves very swiftly.

The heroes in Jason's boat had all won fame before they started out on
this voyage, and many were already warm friends. There was the great
Hercules, and Orpheus, the sweet singer; Castor, who could tame the
wildest horses, and his twin brother Pollux, who was the greatest boxer
the world has ever seen, or perhaps ever will see.

[Illustration: CASTOR, THE HORSE-TAMER; POLLUX, THE MASTER OF THE ART
OF BOXING. From a Greek coin.]

These and many others sat side by side in this boat, which Jason called
the Argo. Many strange things happened to them on their voyage after the
golden fleece. One was when they were attacked by birds. They saw many
new countries also, and one day the Argo sailed by a very strange island
where nearly all the people lived underground. These people never plowed
their land with the strong oxen, nor planted seed, nor reaped harvests.
They had no flocks of woolly sheep, nor herds of cattle.

All day long they worked away under the surface of the earth, digging
and digging at great black stones they found there. Then they sold these
stones or rocks to people in other countries, and so bought bread for
themselves.

These people, with their black faces and grimy hands, left their work
for a little while when someone told them of the beautiful boat that was
in sight. They looked very strange to those in the ship, for no one in
the land from which the Argo came worked under the ground. In that happy
realm everyone lived in the sunshine and worked in the open fields. But
after a while the Argo sailed away from this home of the underground
people and on beyond. Suddenly the sky was darkened and great flocks of
giant birds flew thick and fast above them. Then the wind changed and
the frightened rowers had to take the oars.

The sky grew black as night. Down shot a feather from one of the birds.
It struck one of the rowers on the left shoulder and he dropped his oar,
for the pain was like a spear-thrust. Down sped another arrow feather,
so pointed and sharp that another rower who was hit had to drop his oar.
Thicker and faster came these arrow feathers upon the bare heads and
naked shoulders of the men at the oars.

The best archers shot back at the birds with their sharpest-pointed
arrows, but not a bird was harmed.

"What shall we do?" shouted the men still at the oars.

"You will never kill those birds," said one who had seen their
feather arrows before. "All that you can do is to cover your heads
and let us, who are too badly hurt for rowing, help cover your
shoulders with our shields."

Then those at the oars put on their shining helmets; those who did not
row held up the great war shields over them. The boat looked as if it
had a roof. Down on the helmets came the feathers, so sharp that many of
them made holes in the shining metal. Down on the shields they pelted,
till it seemed as if the sky was raining drops of lead. The birds
themselves came no nearer. But oh, their feather arrows were enough to
frighten even these bravest of men.

The rowers worked as hard and as steadily as they could, and after a
while they were out of reach of the terrible feathers.

The strange part of it all was that they never could find one of those
sharp-pointed arrows with which the birds had shot them.

When the sun came out they were in a safe harbor. They looked and
looked, but not a feather was to be found. One man declared that he knew
the feathers were white.

"But the birds were black," said all the rest. "How could the arrows be
white when even the sun was darkened by the black-winged creatures?"

How the dispute was settled I do not know, for the sharp-pointed
feathers had melted all away, like hailstones from dark storm-clouds. It
is certain, however, that the men never found any of the arrows with
which they had been shot.


WHY THE PARTRIDGE STAYS NEAR THE GROUND

_Greek_


Daedalus was a skillful workman in many ways. One of the first things he
did to make himself famous was to build a maze. It had so many winding
walks and crooked paths that anyone who walked in ten steps without a
guide never could get out unaided.

He built this maze for his king, but before many years he offended the
king in some way and was locked up in a high tower. In the roof of the
tower were hundreds of doves, and as they flew back and forth,
Daedalus said:

"My king rules the land and the sea, but not the air. I will try that
way of escape."

So he set to work to make wings for himself. He shaped two great frames
and covered them with feathers. The largest plumes he sewed on with
thread, and the smaller ones he fastened with wax.

Icarus, his son, stood and looked on, catching any of the feathers the
wind tried to blow away. He troubled his father much, however, by taking
the wax and making little balls, which he tossed about the room.

The keeper of the tower thought the wise man very silly to spend his
time making blankets of feathers, Daedalus never let the keeper of the
tower see how he curved and pointed the corners of his frames. The
keeper told how foolish the wise man had grown from being shut up so
long; how he spent his time gathering feathers to make great blankets.
The people pitied him, not knowing that this very punishment was giving
Daedalus another chance to make himself famous.

One dark night Daedalus fastened the broad wings to his shoulders, and
jumping from the window found he could sail like a dove, but he could
not carry his boy. Back he flew and, folding his wings, slipped into the
window. Now he must make a pair for Icarus.

[Illustration: DAEDALUS AND ICARUS MAKING THEIR WINGS. From a bas-relief
in Rome.]

Soon this second pair was done, but the little fellow had to be taught
like a young bird how to use them. Many a time if Daedalus had not
caught him on his own great wings, Icarus would have gone tumbling heels
over head, down, down to the foot of the tower.

Finally, Icarus, too, could sail like a pigeon, and if the night had not
been so dark it would have been great fun to see these two new birds fly
out of that tower window.

Keeping their wings so close to each other that they almost touched,
they flew away over houses and fields. Before the sun came out, Daedalus
told his boy to be careful to keep near him. "Don't fly too near the
sun, for the heat will melt the wax, nor too low, for the damp will wet
the feathers. Keep close to me."

When the morning dawned they saw the men plowing in the fields stop work
to look at them. Shepherds left their flocks and ran miles to see where
those strange birds were going. No one could tell who they were. It was
grand to be so free and to fly so swiftly.

An eagle saw them and flew near. They felt the breeze from his powerful
wings, and swifter went their own. The eagle, frightened, turned and
mounted toward the sun. Icarus forgot his father's warning and followed.
Daedalus flew on and on, thinking his boy was beside him. Up, up went
Icarus swifter than the eagle and swept proudly past him toward the sun.
The next instant he felt his wings loosen and droop.

Just then, Daedalus, who was miles away, turned his head, for he heard
the boy call him.

"Icarus, Icarus, where are you?" his father shouted. There was no
answer, but the mass of feathers in the blue sea below told the story.
Flying down, Daedalus searched till he found the body, and, tenderly
laying it in the earth he wept that he had ever thought of wings.

The land where this happened was wild, and only savage beasts lived in
it, so Daedalus flew away to Sicily. There he built a temple and on its
walls hung up his wings forever.

He became so proud of his own success that he believed no one else
could invent anything. He was willing, though, to teach others all he
knew, and sister, living near, sent her son, Perdix, to him to learn
what he could.

This boy was quick to see, to hear, and to learn, and he could invent
things himself.

One day when Daedalus was slowly cutting through a log with an ax, the
boy showed him how much quicker he could do it with a saw he had made.
No one had ever heard of a saw before, and Daedalus was angry.

"Who told you how to make this?" he asked.

"I brought home yesterday the backbone of a great fish cast up by the
sea, and I made this like it, but of iron; that is all," said Perdix.

Another time Daedalus was trying to draw a perfect circle. Thirteen
times he tried and failed.

"Take my irons, if you will not be angry with me," said Perdix, and he
handed him a pair of compasses.

Here again was something no man had ever seen. But Daedalus, instead of
being proud of his nephew, was angrier than before.

"You will be claiming that you are greater than Daedalus, who first
sailed through the air, ungrateful boy," said his uncle.

"I have only tried to help you," answered Perdix.

Not long after this, when the two were in a tall building, Daedalus gave
Perdix a push that sent him headlong toward the ground. The goddess
Minerva, who loves learning, saw him falling and changed him into a
partridge before he touched the earth. Unlike Daedalus, he has always
kept his wings.

Perdix, the partridge, builds his nest low on the ground and stays in
low branches. Perhaps he is afraid he may not be saved from another fall
if he goes again into high places.


JUNO'S BIRD, THE PEACOCK

_Roman_


"Oh, isn't it a pity the peacock doesn't know that he can't sing? Why
doesn't he stop that fearful screeching?"

Little Katie put her hands over her ears to keep out the sound.

[Illustration: JUNO AND HER PEACOCK. From an ancient fresco]

"You know the peacock was once an animal that hasn't a very sweet
voice," said Jack.

"No, I don't know, but Charlie Green's pet donkey makes a better noise
than this bird. There, I am glad he has stopped."

"Shall I tell you a story?" asked Jack.

"Once upon a time a donkey felt that he was much abused just because his
coat was rough and his face and shape were so homely; so he begged of
Jupiter to make him into something beautiful. In a short time he was
changed into a peacock and, looking down upon his fine feathers, began
to sing. But, oh, the trouble he was in then! He had forgotten to have
his voice changed, too, and it was the same old donkey voice that he had
always had."

"That's a funny story, Jack. It seems to me that mother told us that a
long time ago."

"Then I know another story of how the eyes came into the peacock's
feathers."

"You are a queer boy, Jack. Those eyes were always there."

"Oh, no, they were not, Kate. You watch the young peacock chickens,
and I'll prove my story, or part of it, anyway. Don't you remember
that at first they are a dull brown, and then, when they are about a
year old, they begin to show a little green? They are three years old
before the eyes begin to show in the feathers. You are a queer girl to
forget that."

"Well, tell your story, and I will see if it is a good one." So
Jack began:

"Argus was a watchman. His great eyes were like green balls, but with
fifty little eyes in each. Yes, he had a hundred eyes, and never more
than two went to sleep at once. He could see even better in the night
than in the daytime, so he was a fine watchman.

"Once Argus was told to watch a certain prisoner who could not be shut
in a room, but had to be left in a field. Not once was he to lose sight
of this prisoner. If he did, every one of his hundred eyes would be
taken from him.

"Day and night Argus watched, never sleeping except with two eyes at a
time. He was as faithful as fifty soldiers.

"But he loved music, and the friends of the prisoner knew it. So they
sent some one to him who could play upon the harp and sing, thinking
that perhaps Argus might be charmed to sleep.

"This player's name was Mercury, and he was so quick that some thought
he wore wings on his feet. If he did wear them, he could take them off
when he liked, for he was just a plain shepherd in a sheepskin coat and
sheepskin sandals when Argus saw him.

"If he had come with a spear, or with bow and arrow, Argus would have
been ready to keep him out, but Mercury was too bright for that.

"No, he was just a plain shepherd, and he sat down in a field near the
one Argus was in, to watch his sheep. While he sat there, he played such
sweet music that Argus said, 'Bring your sheep into my field and we will
watch together.'

"That was just what Mercury had planned. So he was not very long in
getting his sheep into the field with Argus. There the two lay in the
shade of the trees and told stories, and Mercury played and watched the
green eyes of Argus, while Argus watched the prisoner.

"One night Mercury played so softly, so sweetly, that for one minute
every one of the hundred green eyes of Argus closed, the watchman
nodded, and in that minute Mercury struck him on the neck and cut off
his head. Then the prisoner was free. Juno took the green eyes of Argus
and put them on her pet bird, the peacock."

"Oh, Jack, I don't believe a word of it."

"I don't, either," said Jack, "but these stories are both more than two
thousand years old, and I shouldn't wonder if some one did believe them
a long time ago."


THE GIFT OF THE OLIVE TREE

_Greek_


"Has everything a name, father?" asked a wide-awake boy one day.

"Everything I know of has a name," answered the father.

"What is the name of this stone, then?"

"The name of the stone you have just picked up happens to be granite."

"I believe you made that up, father, just because I asked you so
quickly. Really is it granite? Has a rock a name?"

"Why, certainly, my boy. It seems strange that a boy of ten does not
know granite when he sees it."

"But you lived in the country, father, when you were a boy, and I
have been here hardly a month. Oh, here is another kind of stone;
what is this?"

The father cracked the bit of rock so as to get a fresh surface and
then answered:

"Common white quartz, Harold. You are giving me easy specimens, which is
lucky for both of us."

"Why, father, where did you learn all their names?"

"I don't know all their names. I know only the most common ones. To find
the names of some kinds of rock or stone I should need quite an outfit,
such as you may have seen in the high-school laboratory."

"Do all the flowers have names, too, father?"

"Harold, if you could find a flower that has not been named you would
become quite famous. The flower probably would be named after you. Think
of that! There is something to work for; and you were wishing only last
night that you could be a famous man."

"Where did all the flowers get their names? Did the teachers name them?"

"Oh, I suspect the teachers named some, and many people helped them. I
don't believe I ever stopped to think that it is curious that everything
on the earth and in the sea and in the sky is named. You are a very
thoughtful boy, Harold. Ask all the questions you please."

This praise from his quiet father made Harold happier than anything in
the world. He was silent a moment, but then asked:

"Have the stars names, too, father? I mean all of them. I know those
large ones have, for you told me."

"Yes, Harold, every star has a name of some kind. Some of them have only
a letter or a number. But that answers for a name, you know."

"And all the animals, and all the birds, and all the beetles, and all
the--everything! I'll have to go to school just all my life!"

And then Mr. Hadley laughed aloud.

"To-day, father, in the geography class, I learned about many cities,
and there are more in the large geography. Do you know how any of the
cities got their names?"

"What country were you studying about to-day, Harold?"

"It was about Greece, and some of the cities had such long hard names
that I can't remember them. Oh, yes, now I remember Athens. Why, father,
you were there once, for I have heard you tell about Greece; and one of
the pictures in the parlor is named 'In Athens.' Do tell me something
about the place, for I can't make it seem like a real city like New York
or Chicago."

"Do you like olives, Harold?"

"Yes, indeed, I do, and you like olive oil. Oh, of course, olives grow
in Greece. I couldn't think what made you ask such a queer question. Now
tell me about Greece, won't you, please? Is it a beautiful country?"

"Yes, and I'll tell you a tale of the sea, of olives, and of Athens, all
in one. You remember that beautiful head of Minerva, which is near my
book-shelf, do you not? Minerva has another name. She is often called
Athena. She was known to the ancient people of Greece as the goddess of
wisdom and learning. Can you remember the name of the king of the sea?"

[Illustration: ATHENA. From a Greek statue.]

"Neptune, father. You have his picture, too, haven't you?"

"Yes, Harold, but now you must learn the name by which the Greeks called
him. It was Poseidon. The story goes that Athena and Poseidon were each
very anxious to name a certain city in Greece.

"Jupiter said that he would let the one who brought the greatest gift to
the people have the honor of naming the place. And then such strife
began as you can hardly imagine. Poseidon put his wits at work and
called together all his friends for counsel. At last his gift was ready
for the day on which they were to appear before Jupiter.

"Minerva, as she was the goddess of wisdom, needed no such help as
Poseidon had asked and received. Her plans were ready in a moment and
she was waiting for the great day.

"When that day came all the people of the nameless city gathered
together to see what was to be brought them. As they were seated on the
side of mountain, on the top of which stood Jupiter, King Poseidon
appeared on the plain before them, leading a wonderful black horse. It
was covered with gold armor. It pawed the ground and stamped with its
hoofs, and looked like the leader of a grand army. The people shouted
and would have declared for Poseidon without waiting for his rival, but
Jupiter quieted them.

[Illustration: MINERVA. From a Roman statue.]

"Then the goddess came forward on the plain. She was beautiful, tall,
stately. She seemed to be holding something very small in her hand. She
opened her hand before the people and commanded a gardener to dig a hole
in the earth at her feet. Into this hole she dropped the small something
which was in her hand. As soon as the earth was over it, tiny leaves
came out. Then it grew instantly into a tree covered with silver-gray
leaves. Its trunk grew larger and larger. It seemed to touch the skies
It was filled with fruit. She showed them how to extract the oil. She
showed them how to use the fruit.

"The horse neighed and pawed, and Poseidon laughed at the woman's gift.
'Here is war, glory, and power!' he cried.

"'Here is life, peace, and plenty!' said the goddess.

"'The city shall be named Athena' came from Jupiter on the mountain top.

"And so the city of Athens was named and the people loved Athena for her
gift of the olive tree."


THE LINDEN AND THE OAK

_Greek_


Two grand trees stood on a hill near a lake. One was an oak with wide
branches. The other was a linden.

"Man and wife," the people called them, and when asked why, said,
"Because it is true. Once they could walk around and talk. Now they
stand there side by side forever. But you can hear them whisper to each
other sometimes."

And if asked, "Who were they?" even the little children would say, "Why,
Philemon and Baucis."

Many children had these names in those days, and knew the story of the
two trees well, for there were none like them anywhere else in the land.

It was said that these two people who lived in such strange form were
once a poor old couple, and their home was a wretched house in the
valley. Simple, honest, and quiet, they had little to do with their
bustling neighbors.

One evening two strangers walked into the village, and stopping at the
first house to ask for food, were sent away in a hurry.

"We work for a living and have nothing for those who don't. Go away."

They were told the same at the next house, and at the next, all down the
street. Tired and hungry, they neared the cottage where Philemon and
Baucis lived.

"I will try here," said the shorter of the two strangers. The other
was silent.

But before they reached the door, Philemon came to meet them. And Baucis
placed the best chairs for them as they entered, first spreading over
the chairs pieces of cloth she had woven.

"You are hungry," she said, and she went to the fire-place and uncovered
the few coals she had saved in the ashes for her morning fire. On these
she put sticks and dry bark, and with all her little strength, blew hard
on them, and the fire began to burn.

On a hook over the fire she hung a small iron kettle, and getting ready
the beans her husband had brought in from their little garden, she put
them in to stew. All this she did eagerly, as if the strangers were
invited friends. While his wife set the table, Philemon brought a bowl
of water for the guests to bathe their hands. As one leg of the table
was too short, Baucis put a flat shell under to make it level with the
rest. Tired and trembling, she set out a few rude dishes. They were her
best. She added the pitcher of milk Philemon had bought for their own
meal, and when the beans were cooked, everything was ready. For dessert,
she had apples and wild honey.

Drawing a bench to the table, she laid on it a thin cushion made soft
with dried seaweed, and then called the strangers. The smiles and gentle
welcome of the two old people made the meal seem like a feast.

The strangers were very thirsty, but each time Baucis poured out a cup
of milk the pitcher filled again.

"You are people from the skies, and not men!" the old couple cried, and
fell on their knees and begged the strangers to forgive them for their
poor meal.

"Why did you come to us? Others could have done so much better."

"You have done the best you could; who could do better than that?" said
the tall one. "Come with us," and he led them to the top of the hill.

Then he stretched out his hand toward the village, and they saw it sink
down, down out of sight, and the river came rushing in, and the place
was a lake. Nothing could be seen but the house they had just left. It
stood on the shore of the lake. Its timbers were growing higher and
higher, and the yellow straw that thatched the roof changed to shining
gold. It was now a beautiful temple.

"Ask of me anything you wish and I will give it to you," said the tall
one.

"I know now you are Jupiter," said Philemon. "Let us take care of your
temple while we live, and when it is time for us to leave it let us go
together. Let not one be taken and the other left."

Philemon and Baucis cared for the beautiful temple for years. Feeling
old and weary, they went to the top of the hill one day to say good-by
to all things. As they stood there they saw each other change, one into
this oak and the other into this linden.

"Good-by," they said together, as the bark grew up over their lips.

No tree has so strong and true a heart as the oak, and in the leafy
linden hundreds of birds sing and are happy.


THE LITTLE MAIDEN WHO BECAME A LAUREL TREE

_Greek_


Cupid was a beautiful little boy. Between the wings on his shoulders he
always carried a quiver full of tiny arrows. Bow in hand, he started out
every morning ready, like any boy, for mischief. One day he came to
drink from a fountain with some thirsty doves who were his friends.

Apollo saw the little fellow and, to tease him, asked:

"What do you carry arrows for, saucy boy? It is for great gods like
myself to do that. My arrow shot the terrible python, the serpent of
darkness. What can _you_ do?"

"Apollo may hit serpents, but I will hit Apollo," said Cupid, and taking
out two tiny arrows, one of gold and one of lead, he touched their
points together and then shot the golden one straight into Apollo.

Quick as a flash of Apollo's sun-crown, Cupid shot the other, the leaden
one, into a river cloud he saw floating by. In it he knew Daphne, the
daughter of the river, was hidden. The leaden arrow hit her true, but
she drifted away on the swift breeze.

Apollo, the sun-god, can see through everything except fog and mist, but
as Daphne fled he caught one glimpse of her face, and Cupid laughed to
see how his arrow did its work. His arrows never kill; sometimes,
indeed, they make life happier. Apollo now loved Daphne more than
anything else on earth. Daphne was more afraid of him than of anything
else in the sky.

On flew Daphne, hoping her misty cloud would hide her till she could
reach her river home. On flew Apollo, begging her to stop for fear his
arrows might hurt her. His great arrows of sunlight must do their work
even if his friends should perish by them.

As they neared the river he saw her face again. She sank on the river
bank. She was faint and he would comfort her but she cried to her
father, the river, "O father, help!" The earth opened, and before
Apollo could reach her he saw her waving hair change into glistening
leaves. Her arms became branches. Her skin changed to dainty bark, and
her face to a tree-top whose pink flowers show, even yet, the beauty of
Daphne's cheek. Apollo reached out and gathered the leaves and made
them into a crown.

[Illustration: DAPHNE. Changing into a laurel tree. From an old painting]

"This tree shall be called laurel, and it shall be mine," he said. "I
cannot grow old and the leaves of this tree shall be always green.
Daphne has won the race against Apollo, the wreath of these leaves shall
be her gift and mine to the bravest in every race. Kings and captains
shall be proud to wear it."

Apollo hid his face for days behind dark clouds. Heavy rains fell. The
immortal gods cannot weep, but these great drops seemed like tears for
lost Daphne.

Even saucy Cupid mourned, and he did not dare go out till the storms
were over, for fear Apollo's grief would spoil his wings.

In cold northern lands you can find Daphne's tree in greenhouses among
the roses and lilies. And if you ask for Daphne, the gardener will point
her out, for he calls the tree by her name.


THE LESSON OF THE LEAVES

_Roman_


In a cave by the seashore lived an old, old woman. This very old woman
was also very wise.

She remembered everything that had ever happened and she knew almost
everything that was going to happen in her country.

She lived in Italy and was called the Sibyl.

One day a man named Aeneas came to her cave to question her. She was
very kind to him. She even took him far down into the center of the
earth, Pluto's kingdom, to see those whom Pluto had carried away.

When they came back, Aeneas said he would build a temple to her and have
gifts brought to her. She had so much power and was so wise he felt sure
she must be more than mortal. But she would not let Aeneas build the
temple. Instead she told him her story. It was this:

"Apollo saw me when I was young, and told me to ask him for any gift I
would have. We were standing on the seashore. I stooped down and filled
my hand with the white sand at our feet.

"'Give me as many birthdays as there are grains of sand in my hand, O
Apollo!' I said.

"'It is granted,' said Apollo. But, in my foolishness, I forgot to ask
for everlasting youth.

"When one hundred grains of sand had slipped away from the glass in
which I placed them all, I was old. My youth was gone.

"Seven hundred grains have slipped through now. I have counted the rest.
I shall yet see three hundred springs and three hundred harvests; then
the Sibyl will be no more. My body has shriveled. Soon I shall be only a
warning voice to the children of men, but I shall live till the grains
are gone from that glade. While my voice lasts men will respect my
sayings. As long as I live, I will strive to help the human race."

Aeneas went with her into the cave. The leaves were thick on the floor.
The Sibyl picked them up and wrote with an eagle's quill on each.

She let him read as many as he wished. He found some of them were
warnings to his friends. Some were for people he had never seen. The
Sibyl placed them in rows on the ledges of rock inside the cavern.

A fierce wind blew into the cave and carried the written leaves away.

"Save them, O Sibyl!" As King Louis did not respond, then recognized the cabinet in Berlin
during the winter itself, that you probably do not, the negotiations
even more to entangle, and let Baden provisionally from the games.

On 6 March 1829 finally began official talks in Berlin.

The southern German crowns were covered by their envoys, and Blomberg Luxburg
represent the rash had Cotta, the two kings had power of attorney. For
Prussia appeared Eichhorn and Schoenberg, plus Motz, Maassen and Fiscal
wind horn.

Hofmann also came over from Darmstadt. The first of the government forces
were posses it was the bridge over the Main to beat. On 27 May 1829, the
contract was signed. Prussia-Hesse-Württemberg and Bavaria have promised
each other until the 1841 tariff for all domestic products of nature,
industry and hard work of art only for a number of important plant
products should, in Bavaria Andringen, initially only a customs
facilitation by 25 percent, was to gradually the total liberation
could take place.

Both parts agreed, their customs systems more and more in conformity
to it; annually Agents should meet "for fixing and extending the
contract."

Even an inch cartel has been agreed for the future. The contract was
in all the character of a temporary, he founded the closest form
of trade association, which could be achieved as long as the countries
of the allies are not in a fixed geographical context stood.

All participants felt that they were in the beginning of a period
of common commercial policy actions were, they committed themselves
to the Protocol, trade agreements with such countries, the association
of several neighboring states also, so primarily with bathing, only
in the common consent process.

Oblivious by the embarrassment of individual negotiations Motz held his
gaze firmly on the major conditions of the Fatherland addressed, he
knew that his state of the railways to a proud future had opened. In
June, he spoke out against the king on the political significance of the
contracts open.

His first memoir raises a review of the completed inability of the
Bundestag, who never in a formal consultation on the trading unit was
underfoot, even during the Emergency of 1817 in Frankfurt, you've
only just done so much, "the federal neighbor, in the literal sense
of the word not to starve.

How could it be otherwise, since the German league a great statesman at
the helm is the peculiar him since 50 years already existing, his
private interest and therefore supposedly cooperating with the
interests of other states of the German Confederation, but are not
reconcilable Customs and Prohibitivsystem is unwilling to give up,
because other members of the federal interests of its main trading
countries which are not subordinated to their State which are much
more the latter, naturally and properly, to the former festgeknüpft
have, and still others because the subject only from fiscal as
factors considered staatswirtschaftlichem want to know?

The German federal government gave an example of how the general history
until then states do not record "and it was a trade war of all
against all," was far worse than a war of the inner arms only ever
could have been. " Then Motz remembers the patriotic aspirations
of the German trade stand on the personal efforts of the Sovereign
of Bavaria and Württemberg.

As both the Bavarian-Wuerttemberg and the Prussian-Hessian association
is formed, was the possibility of two large customs clubs in Germany
before. Then under the leadership of Austria-neutral society, the *
status quo *, ie the unbearable maintain it, he forced us to
immediately to go further, and the great trading system be given.

This system, continues the memorandum continued, firstly, provides
commercial advantages.

The link already contains 20 million inhabitants, thus claiming the
third place among the European states, as Austria is not a lot of
power forms, and it will rise to 25 million once the Mitteldeutsche
Association is responsible, "that he was vain, and even a purpose"
and the southern and central German states of Mecklenburg us join
together, they will rise to 27 million, although the other states
(if they are not ancillary land), so Hanover, Brunswick, Oldenburg
and the Hanseatic cities occur.

The inner circulation is more important than the Foreign Trade
proposes that three times, once in those years as the capital around.

Some German states obtained by the trading system has a twenty-to
zweihundertmal larger market for their products. In addition,
secondly, the financial benefits. The sentence: "je cheaper to deliver,
the greater the earnings," will also prove this, although perhaps the
first transition period may take some losses.

More importantly, thirdly, the political gain. "If it is state of
scientific truth is that only the duties result of political separation
of different states, so it must also be true that some of these countries
into a customs and trade associations also agreed to a political
system and the same with him."

Now is broadly the friderizianische policy towards the Wittelsbacher
stories: how the first non-Friedrich Austrians, Charles VII, the emperor
raised throne, and then by the Bavarian war of succession and the
prince three federal Bavaria had rescued from sinking. Prussia has of
yet not all fruit is harvested. Bavaria's hostile attitude to the time
of the Rhine Confederation and the Ansbach-Baireuther Handel
explained only "total confusion and aberration of the policy states"
those revolutionary days.

Today, however, can not censure Prussia instill more, but
must wish, "with all the states, the only truly German interests
led Prussia and with an open show of confidence, but not about the
possession of German provinces merely as a vehicle for promoting
the interests of their greater external, foreign interests of Germany
states seek to use the body, in every respect, politically and
commercially, is quite profound and quite close to connect. " Remains
possible but for now, however, "not easily gedenkbare" event that
either a general war ausbräche, or "that the German federal government
in its current form once dissolved, and with the exclusion of all
the heterogeneous parts are newly designed", then our trading system
would tremendously important.

Fourthly, we bring the trading system to gain a military man Bayerns 92000
Access decided the wars of 1805 and 1806 to Napoleon's favor, as the
Rhine Confederation the war of 1809. Against France, we can only
cover our Rhineland, if we are safe Bavarian Palatinate; Austria but
is determined by the federal trade in a wide arc, can of Old Bavaria
and Silesia since both are threatened.

The memorandum concludes: "In this, at the same interest and the
natural basis dormant and needed in the middle of Germany extended
connection is again a truth allied, from inside and outside firm
and free of Germany under the protection and screen consist of
Prussia .

Let only the still missing and further complements the already acquired
with diligent care and further training will be held, "To the
Prussian Finance Minister, one year before the July Revolution, two
years before Paul Pfizer (103) the correspondence of two Germans
did appear!

Among all the German national men's statements from that period is
not that so vigorously with the policy of peaceful dualism breaks,
so some heraussagt: going from Austria!

And the security of the gaze in everything! The man already knew in
1829 and a slight mistake exactly in what order until 1866, the German
states, the Zollverein joined. In a circular to the Prussian envoy said
the government is open: the treaty with Bavaria was a closer association
and the gradual realization of German unity in trade prospect. yet
remained at the Bavarian court of one thousand doubts to overcome.

King Ludwig, accustomed to absolute self-rule, violently angry because
his sub-dealer in some areas exceeded their instructions were, he was
the old mistrust of the Southern German Prussian tricks not overcome
mäkelte on every word, feared everywhere dual interpretation.

The famous dispute over the * Alternate * (104), which in those
days of leisure Bundestagsgesandten worthy filled, was disturbing. The
Royal Courts wanted the Grand Ducal probably the equality of precedence,
but not the signatures are approved, after much heartbreak to keep you
at last, produced only two main instruments, the one for Prussia-Hesse,
the other for-Württemberg Bavaria jointly.

They understood the fear of the Munich Court before his Kleinmeisterei
Landtag.

Cotta asked implore: "not to forget that we ourselves must Fröhner
prejudice to the higher purposes to achieve great, especially the
club."

In the same spirit of Armansperg Motz wrote: "it certainly blessed plant,
which began with the trade agreement now in life will come, Germany is
due largely to the greatness of your ideas and active care, which Ew.
Among the acts of excellence initiated and to remove any bias
sought.

If the spirit Ew. Some excellence that our desires aim seem churlish,
then you might consider that in the halls of the stands and some
petty hauset not always the weapon of reason and fight can be
defeated "- which then in the interest of the Oberpfalz Hammer Works
was asked to coarse Ironmongery article under the exception to make.

During the summer, even in Cotta Brückenau Friedrichshafen and the
last concerns of the two southern kings pacifies it ratified, overwhelmed
the skilled negotiator with favor. King William was equally at ease
as his Minister Varnbüler; from the old dreams Caesars was no
question.

Then Prussia sent two of its best financial men, Sotzmann and
Pochhammer to Munich in order to introduce new customs facilities
to help.

The Bavarian officials amazed, so much patience and saving for the
disreputable Prussia to find in common came to serious work you
closer together.

Now the hard decision was taken, King Ludwig sailed immediately with
restless impetuosity in the new fairway then.

He praised in the exuberant words probity, moderation, the size of
the views of the Berlin Cabinet, assured the sculptor smoke, how
proud he was, with the state of Frederick hand in hand to go as
righteous and wise king Friedrich Wilhelm to have kept.

Public opinion in the south took the full contract to mistrust and a
Deputation to the kings of the gratitude of the good town of Nördlingen,
was remained a sporadic phenomenon. In the higher circles of the
Bavarian civil service but we felt that finally, after long
wanderings solid ground anchor was found.

The Bundestag Lerchenfeld envoys received strict instructions to the
Central German labels must contain, and now seemed to Frankfurt and
Kassel in good faith with its Prussian comrades together. The freer
people sensed from the outset that this is a healthy natural
alliance between the two largest German states had to continue.

Already at the Berlin negotiations, Hofmann questioned whether Prussia's
western provinces to the south once a real Zollverein should form. In
this immature form of the idea was unacceptable to Prussia. Once the
contract said, but quickly showed that you can not half-way stop could.
The Bavarian Rheinpfalz Bavarian tolls received, since you are in
Munich did not have to decide, to the Prussian customs system
inserted.

The result was dismal: the province in 1830 was only 165,000 guilders
in customs duties, while the border guard devoured 248,000 guilders. The
council asked the Palatinate and complained, the state could not
last.

Already in February 1830 asked the tireless Cotta Hofmann confidential
at how you have customs at full communion with the Prussian authorities
require.

Hofmann replied with a warm praise for the Prussian officer who
initially showed very suspicious, but afterwards, once the reliability
of the Hessian administration met, were very sociable.

The Foreign and his companions, the Mitteldeutsche, looked with growing
horror, as Prussia's trade policy within a year a second major success
achieved.

In vain did the Saxon Cabinet during the negotiations of the Berlin
Munich Court for the Central German Confederation advertised; Nassauer
vain was the X-ray, that old enemy vielgeschäftige Prussia, traveled
to Stuttgart, where present: Motz, the nefarious force ambitious
man who wanted to Prussia by the unleashing the forces of industrial
power Germany's senior levy. In Berlin itself worked some agents of
the German Central Association, said the senator Guaita Frankfurt.
Austria sent the Hofrat Eichhof to Munich for Bavaria by offering
some minor trade facilitation hinwegzulocken of Prussia, while the
King Ludwig to remember how hostile to Prussia in the matter acted
Sponheim.

Münchheide in Frankfurt tried once again, the Darmstadt court against
Hofmann, "this tool Prussia," einzunehmen. The diplomacy of England,
France, Holland - advancing Lord Erskine and Earl Rumigny in Munich - was
not tired, to warn against Prussia. Of all the foreign powers was again
only Russia as a loyal friend of Prussia; Anstett in Frankfurt
said openly and forcefully for the Berlin trade policy.

Gradually it began to fait to practice her magic.

How long should you have abused the claims of the nation endure?

How long is abquälen at all times Sonderbünden futile, while Prussia
any trade negotiation successfully hinausführte regularly?

Even Blittersdorff, the restless party goers of Austria, was now
the thing Habsburg almost lost.

If Prussia, he wrote, all the German states under its unified
trading system, then factually Austria from German Bunde hinausgedrängt!

The traffic is not centralized, but in the big number of our young
hearts, evenly everywhere be revived.

The threats to sovereignty are low in a large Zollverein than if you
try, the time in the way to replace them. - The negotiations between
Prussia and Bavaria remained a slap in the water, as long as the traffic
between the two states the arbitrary "Retorsionen" of the German
Central Association subject. The new road from Westphalia
through the intestinal urban area connected only the western
provinces of Prussia with the countries of the southern German
allies, and also resulted in the Frankfurt area for several hours
by the German Central Association country.

If the Prussian-Bavarian Federation of life force to win, it was a duty-free
road between the main masses of the two allied associations
indispensable duty.

As remembered Motz good time to the road Meininger arrogance of empire and
those untertänigen Gothaer apology letter from the duke.

Like now, when the Prussians Meininger landing the funds provided,
that trade route between Italy and the North Sea actually build?

The desire to traffic in the country to hold so remained the highest
idea of the trade policy of small states in those days was capable.

How often are the statesmen of the Ernestine to Munich or Berlin
geeilt to urgent requests by the construction of a bypass to prevent
wailed like Frankfurt, in spring 1829 as a freight forwarder of
goods from Switzerland to Leipzig and Nuremberg sent freight cheaper
than its calculated Frankfurt competitors.

This road was the best policy tools of the Central German club, and Motz
decided that the allies with their own weapons to beat. He opened
negotiations with Gotha and Meiningen, even before the Bavarian
contract was completed. The Duke of Koburg came to Berlin himself. On
3 July 1829 was Meiningen, Gotha day with a contract, "to remove
barriers to the excellent relationships with local trade and
commercial traffic preclude".

The three countries committed themselves together, a great street to
build from Langensalza on after cell Gotha, Meiningen from then on to
Würzburg and Suhl, Hildburghausen, Lichtenfels to Bamberg.

Prussia shot the young men the money before. The Durchfuhrhandel on the
new road has been completely released. These multiple customs
facilitation and free trade between neighborhood Meiningen, Gotha,
Prussia and Thuringia enclaves.

It was the same road across the crest of the Thuringian Forest,
which later in the railway policy of the German Empire, once again plays
a significant role to play.

These two contracts have inconspicuous in truth the club Mitteldeutsche
destroyed. For now, the Prussian-Bavarian Treaty practical value.
Motz himself hastened to Thuringia, to the rapid expansion of roads
to promote.

Once this duty-free street was completed, the two were allies in a safe
Customs clubs geographical connection, its full merger was only a matter
of time. At the same time, the Berlin Cabinet of Mecklenburg with
the construction of a new road from Hamburg to Magdeburg's inception.
The mighty Warenzug between the North Sea and Switzerland, was
from Hanover, Kassel and Frankfurt hinweggelenkt to the streets of
Magdeburg-Nuremberg.

The Mitteldeutsche association of Bavaria and Prussia should keep
apart, was a master string the Prussian diplomacy itself in the
middle split.

Repeatedly pushing the idea on how much slower the knot would unravel
itself can, if a Reichstag diplomatic action by the Berlin Court
paralyzed. Those who work underground on their winding paths
pursued, must, if not approve, then understand that a free spirit
such as Trendelenburg (105), then the Prussian absolutism as a
blessing for Germany praised.

Prussians took those two contracts with only one indeed permitted
Kriegslist resist opponents said, but no hostile step, no nasty Retorsion.
The defeat of the Central German club was so full because nobody had the
right to complain to about Prussia.

While otherwise the trade policy of the enemy by making trade is
looking to beat, disarmed and Motz Eichhorn the Kasseler Sonderbund
through the facilitation of the German transport, they could even
the gratitude of the Central German claim for the opening of a
duty-free road.

The two princes Thuringian certainly not enough of the history of
credit.

Tempts by the prospect of holding a major trade route, the Dukes of traitors
to their central German allies. They hurt not the wording but the meaning
of the contract Kasseler the allies, however, the conclusion of
commercial contracts allowed, but certainly the end pursued, the
expansion of the Prussian customs system to prevent.

The bad example awoke soon imitation. The Mitteldeutsche club,
founded by particularistic self-seeking, should be a dignified
end, he should gradually disintegrate by a frivolous game with good
faith.

Motz also prepared in this summer did the Mitteldeutsche still a
surprise, the blessing of their trade, their Sonderbund brought ruin.
It agreed with the Netherlands on the Rhine and then opened its
southern allies, the prospect of free trade in the North Sea.

Once the British merchant his goods duty free rhein up to Frankfurt
and Mannheim could send, England had an interest in the Central
German club to lose, and the Special Bunde was deprived of a powerful
restraint. - After such a thorough defeat would have serious statesmen
the Sonderbund as a chaotic attempt to give up immediately and an
understanding with the superior customs organizations of the South
and the North need.

But the indestructible Zanksucht these small farms did not want to
keep peace, their arrogance Resists a shameful confession.

The Saxon envoy in Vienna, Count Schulenburg, did wonders to tell
of the trade facilitation, the general intimations Metternich in
the club promised similar commitments, as well as common held, gave
the French envoy Graf Fenelon Nassauer the court.

Hanover still lived in the old Guelph pride; Count Munster was all the
little Arts to support the Meininger duke by his sister, the Duchess
of Clarence, to be deducted from Prussia. In February 1829 was from
Ense Varnhagen (106) by the Prussian government in Kassel and Bonn had
been sent to another settlement of the marital strife in the
electoral home to try.

He had the thankless task with amazing maladroitly discards, in
Hruby, the fierce Prussia's enemies, can teach itself about the
situation.

The end was that the two husbands incongruous than ever stood facing
each other, and the elector in foaming anger his royal brother
swore revenge.

Urania, the Muse who loved the heavens, believed that he was from some
star world.

Clio, the Muse of History, knew that no such creature had ever lived on
earth before.

They all watched for his return. The next morning he was seen again at
the fountain; after that he came every day. The Muses named him Pegasus.

"We know that there is a work for all created things. What can his be?"
the sisters asked one another.

Sure enough his work came at last.

In a distant land was a brave young soldier named Bellerophon. He was so
bold, so fearless, and so handsome that those who ought to have been his
friends became jealous of him. That means trouble, you know.

Bellerophon wished to travel. His king gave him letters on parchment to
take to King Iobates of Lycia.

The king did not read the letters for ten days after Bellerophon came to
Lycia. During those ten days there was feasting and dancing in honor of
the new guest.

After the feasts of welcome were over, King Iobates read the letters and
found that the one who sent them wanted Bellerophon punished for certain
misdeeds which people said he had done.

It was a sharp trick to send such letters by the very person who was to
be punished. King Iobates was puzzled as to what to do.

Then some of his wise men told him of the terrible chimera that was in
the west of his kingdom. This strange creature had the head of a lion,
the body of a goat, and the tail of a crocodile. Its breath was flames
of fire, so the peasants said. Nobody dared to attack it.

"Just the thing," said Iobates to himself, and sent for Bellerophon.

"You are the one to rid my country of this terrible monster. Do you dare
to try such a task?"

Brave Bellerophon answered, "I have no fear; my heart is pure; my
strength is as the strength of ten. I will go."

[Illustration: BELLEROPHON AND PEGASUS. At the Fountain of the Muses on
Mount Helicon.]

That night he slept in the temple of Minerva, the wise goddess. He
dreamed that Minerva brought him a golden bridle and told him to go to
the fountain of Pirene and find Pegasus.

When he awoke the golden bridle was in his hand.

He went to the fountain and there he saw Pegasus drinking. Bellerophon
held up the bridle and for the first time Pegasus was caught.

The brave soldier leapt on the winged horse's back and Pegasus struck
his hoofs once against the earth, and then sprang lightly towards the
sky. He spread his wings and the nine Muses saw him sailing in the air
with a rider on his back.

"He has found his work," said Clio.

Bellerophon could see over all the land. He found the terrible chimera
and slew it. For all its strange shape and fearful looks, it was not
such a fierce animal as he had feared.

Pegasus took his rider quickly back to King Iobates' palace and then
vanished. He was found the next morning by the nine Muses drinking at
their fountain.

Bellerophon was given another hard task to do when the king found that
he had lived through his first.

Pegasus came at his call, and with his help everything was easy.

But as soon as one work was done King Iobates found another.

Bellerophon suspected nothing, and went bravely out to help his
friend the king.

At last King Iobates said he had nothing more for him to do. After a
time Bellerophon married the king's daughter and lived quietly at
home in Lycia.

Pegasus, the pet of the nine Muses, became so gentle that he would let
them soar to the skies on his back, but no mortal save Bellerophon dared
to touch him.

Bellerophon, having no more great earthly tasks to do, called his winged
steed one morning and dared to attempt to guide him to Mount Olympus,
011 whose lofty top sat the great Jupiter on his throne in the clouds.

Jupiter, seeing him coming, sent a single gadfly to sting the tender
skin of Pegasus. The gadfly dealt a cruel blow and proud Pegasus thought
Bellerophon had dared to strike him.

He reared upon his haunches and sent Bellerophon reeling downward to
earth, the victim of a selfish wish to outdo others. Bellerophon fell
upon a rocky field far from any city. His fall made him both lame and
blind. Separated from his friends he wandered alone, living as best he
could, and it is not known what became of him. His winged steed fled to
the fountain on Mount Helicon, but never again came at his call. He
could not forget the sharp sting of the gadfly.

Some have fancied that those who love the Muses see him even in these
days, and that the flash of his golden bridle is caught by a gifted few
once in each century.


SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS


In the earlier ages everything in nature had its myth. We have been too
practical and too full of haste in these latter days to listen to nature
or to myths, but let us inspire the children to do so. Who among us has
not regretted his lack of knowledge of some mythical person, in song,
picture, or story?

The greater number of ways in which a truth is presented to the child,
the stronger the impression that truth makes upon him. Music, painting,
sculpture, architecture, and language, written or spoken, have each told
the story of the sun and its glorious power over earthly creatures.

Each nation has its myth concerning the sun's personality. Some may have
adapted or adopted those of other nations; some may have originated
their own theory to explain the origin of the heat and light which come
from the apparent ruler of the skies. The myth is preserved through the
ages, and the child in the school perceives its beauty, while he
understands as well as his teacher its impossibility.

Let the plain scientific truths of the latest researches be given
first. Then the fable, or folklore, or former explanation which once
vouched for the origin of the sun, moon, or stars, or other natural
objects, seems to the children like their own childish fancies about
things unknown.

The story should follow, if possible, a tale or lesson on the subject of
the myth. If the children have already had the scientific truths given
them, then the myth serves as a reminder of facts already learned.

The special directions are merely suggestive. Teachers will supplement
them or substitute others at their pleasure.


SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LESSON ON PHAETON.


Secure, if possible, before the reading of the story of Phaeton, a good
plaster cast or marble bust of Apollo, or some reproduction of the
Aurora of Guido Reni. Show a picture of the temple of Apollo, if one can
be obtained; let the children understand how much a part of the life of
the Greek was this belief in Apollo's power and Apollo's beauty. The
child will then begin to understand how much the ancients strove after
beauty in all things.

The Indian, African, and Chinese all have their stories of the origin
of light and heat, and history and geography may assist in this lesson
on Phaeton.

Sprinkle water on the window sill, and notice its disappearance,
caused by the heat of sunshine or of the room. Ask for the reason of a
similar loss of water in the street, road, or river. What is the sun's
color? What is the color of fire? What is the sun's effect on ice and
snow, on vegetable and animal life? Does it work quietly? Is great
power usually quiet?

Lower the shades in the schoolroom. Why is it dark? Close the eyes. Why
is it dark? What is darkness? What causes dark or dull days? What shapes
do clouds take? Are they ever like horses, cattle, sheep, or swans? Is
the sun somewhere always shining? Are clouds like curtains? Paint or
draw a sunrise or sunset.

Notice a rainbow, when possible, and form one with a prism in the
schoolroom. What colors of the prism are shown most in sunset or
sunrise? Are all shown each time? How many have seen the same colors on
a soap bubble or elsewhere? Mention some other name of the sun, as Sol;
the derivation of Sunday; the effect of the sun on the seasons. Describe
spring, summer, autumn, and winter as persons. Is the sun king of the
hours, the days, the months, and the years? Did the ancients know the
real truth concerning the distance, size, and nightly disappearance of
the sun? Where is the Great Bear? The Little Bear? Do you think the
ancient Greeks really believed the story of Phaeton?

Reproduce it orally after reading.

_Each myth may be developed in a similar way_.
