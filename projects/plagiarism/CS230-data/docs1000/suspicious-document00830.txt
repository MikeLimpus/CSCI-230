014:027 If there is speaking in an unknown tongue, only two or at the most
        three should speak, and they should do so one at a time,
        and one should interpret;
014:028 or if there is no interpreter, let the man with the gift
        be silent in the Church, speaking to himself and to God.
014:029 But if there are Prophets, let two or three speak and let
        the rest judge.
014:030 And if anything is revealed to some one else who is seated there,
        let the first be silent.
014:031 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn
        and all be encouraged:
014:032 and the spirits of Prophets yield submission to Prophets.
014:033 For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace, as He is in all
        the Churches of His people.
014:034 Let married women be silent in the Churches, for they are not
        permitted to speak.  They must be content with a subordinate place,
        as the Law also says;
014:035 and if they wish to ask questions, they should ask their own
        husbands at home.  For it is disgraceful for a married woman
        to speak at a Church assembly.
014:036 Was it from you that God's Message first went forth, or is it
        to you only that it has come?
014:037 If any one deems himself to be a Prophet or a man with
        spiritual gifts, let him recognize as the Lord's command
        all that I am now writing to you.
014:038 But if any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
014:039 The conclusion, my brethren, is this.  Be earnestly ambitious
        to prophesy, and do not check speaking with tongues;
014:040 only let everything be done in a becoming and orderly manner.
015:001 But let me recall to you, brethren, the Good News which I
        brought you, which you accepted, and on which you are standing,
015:002 through which also you are obtaining salvation, if you bear
        in mind the words in which I proclaimed it--unless indeed
        your faith has been unreal from the very first.
015:003 For I repeated to you the all-important fact which also I
        had been taught, that Christ died for our sins in accordance
        with the Scriptures;
015:004 that He was buried; that He rose to life again on the third
        day in accordance with the Scriptures,
015:005 and was seen by Peter, and then by the Twelve.
015:006 Afterwards He was seen by more than five hundred brethren
        at once, most of whom are still alive, although some of them
        have now fallen asleep.
015:007 Afterwards He was seen by James, and then by all the Apostles.
015:008 And last of all, as to one of untimely birth, He appeared
        to me also.
015:009 For I am the least of the Apostles, and am not fit to be called
        an Apostle--because I persecuted the Church of God.
015:010 But what I am I am by the grace of God, and His grace
        bestowed upon me did not prove ineffectual.  But I labored
        more strenuously than all the rest--yet it was not I,
        but God's grace working with me.
015:011 But whether it is I or they, this is the way we preach and
        the way that you came to believe.
015:012 But if Christ is preached as having risen from the dead,
        how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing
        as a resurrection of the dead?
015:013 If there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead,
        then Christ Himself has not risen to life.
015:014 And if Christ has not risen, it follows that what we preach
        is a delusion, and that your faith also is a delusion.
015:015 Nay more, we are actually being discovered to be bearing false
        witness about God, because we have testified that God raised
        Christ to life, whom He did not raise, if in reality none
        of the dead are raised.
015:016 For if none of the dead are raised to life, then Christ
        has not risen;
015:017 and if Christ has not risen, your faith is a vain thing--
        you are still in your sins.
015:018 It follows also that those who have fallen asleep in
        Christ have perished.
015:019 If in this present life we have a *hope* resting on Christ,
        and nothing more, we are more to be pitied than all the rest
        of the world.
015:020 But, in reality, Christ *has* risen from among the dead,
        being the first to do so of those who are asleep.
015:021 For seeing that death came through man, through man comes
        also the resurrection of the dead.
015:022 For just as through Adam all die, so also through Christ all
        will be made alive again.
015:023 But this will happen to each in the right order--Christ having
        been the first to rise, and afterwards Christ's people rising
        at His return.
015:024 Later on, comes the End, when He is to surrender the Kingship
        to God, the Father, when He shall have overthrown all other
        government and all other authority and power.
015:025 For He must continue King until He shall have put all His
        enemies under His feet.
015:026 The last enemy that is to be overthrown is Death;
015:027 for He will have put all things in subjection under His feet.
        [Footnote 8: Corrections in the original.]
        [Footnote 9: We are indebted to the last number of _Chambers'
        Edinburgh Journal_ for this
interesting supplement to the various particulars respecting the
        capture of the Duke of Monmouth which have already appeared
        in our columns. It there forms the conclusion of an article
        on the last
days of this unfortunate nobleman, founded on the communications
        which have been made to the "NOTES AND QUERIES," and kindly adduced
to show the utility of our paper.If the dead do not rise at all,
        why are these baptized for them?
015:030 Why also do we Apostles expose ourselves to danger every hour?
015:031 I protest, brethren, as surely as I glory over you--
        which I may justly do in Christ Jesus our Lord--that I die
        day by day.
015:032 If from merely human motives I have fought with wild beasts
        in Ephesus, what profit is it to me?  If the dead do not rise,
        let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.
015:033 Do not deceive yourselves:  "Evil companionships
        corrupt good morals."
015:034 Wake from this drunken fit; live righteous lives, and cease to sin;
        for some have no knowledge of God:  I speak thus in order
        to move you to shame.
015:035 But some one will say, "How can the dead rise?
        And with what kind of body do they come back?"
015:036 Foolish man! the seed you yourself sow has no life given to it
        unless it first dies;
015:037 and as for what you sow, it is not the plant which is to be
        that you are sowing, but a bare grain, of wheat (it may be)
        or of something else, and God gives it a body as He has seen fit,
015:038 and to each kind of seed a body of its own.
015:039 All flesh is not the same:  there is human flesh, and flesh
        of cattle, of birds, and of fishes.
015:040 There are bodies which are celestial and there are bodies which
        are earthly, but the glory of the celestial ones is one thing,
        and that of the earthly ones is another.
015:041 There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another
        of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
015:042 It is the same with the resurrection of the dead.  The body
        is sown in a state of decay, it is raised free from decay;
015:043 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown
        in weakness, it is raised in power;
015:044 an animal body is sown, a spiritual body is raised.
        As surely as there is an animal body, so there is also
        a spiritual body.
