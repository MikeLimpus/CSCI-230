'
021:039 "So they seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard,
        and killed him.
021:040 When then the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do
        to those vine-dressers?"
021:041 "He will put the wretches to a wretched death," was the reply,
        "and will entrust the vineyard to other vine-dressers who will
        render the produce to him at the vintage season."
021:042 "Have you never read in the Scriptures," said Jesus, "`The Stone
        which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone:
        this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful
        in our eyes'?
021:043 "That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be
        taken away from you, and given to a nation that will exhibit
        the power of it.
021:044 He who falls on this stone will be severely hurt; but he on
        whom it falls will be utterly crushed."
021:045 After listening to His parables the High Priests and the Pharisees
        perceived that He was speaking about them;
021:046 but though they were eager to lay hands upon Him, they were afraid
        of the people, for by them He was regarded as a Prophet.
022:001 Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language.
022:002 "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "may be compared
        to a king who celebrated the marriage of his son,
022:003 and sent his servants to call the invited guests to the wedding,
        but they were unwilling to come.
022:004 "Again he sent other servants with a message to those who
        were invited.  "`My breakfast is now ready," he said, `my bullocks
        and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made:
        come to the wedding.'
022:005 "They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country,
        another to his business;
022:006 and the rest seized the king's servants, maltreated them,
        and murdered them.
022:007 So the king's anger was stirred, and he sent his troops
        and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.
022:008 Then he said to his servants, "`The wedding banquet is ready,
        but those who were invited were unworthy of it.
022:009 Go out therefore to the crossroads, and everybody you meet
        invite to the wedding.'
022:010 "So they went out into the roads and gathered together all
        they could find, both bad and good, and the banqueting hall
        was filled with guests.
022:011 "Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them
        he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe.
022:012 "`My friend,' he said, `how is it that you came in here without
        a wedding robe?'
022:013 "The man stood speechless.  Then the king said to the servants,
        "`Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside:
        there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.'
022:014 "For there are many called, but few chosen."
022:015 Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might
        entrap Him in His conversation.
022:016 So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians;
        who said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you
        faithfully teach God's truth; and that no fear of man misleads you,
        for you are not biased by men's wealth or rank.
022:017 Give us your judgement therefore:  is it allowable for us
        to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"
022:018 Perceiving their wickedness, Jesus replied, "Why are you
        hypocrites trying to ensnare me?
022:019 Show me the tribute coin."  And they brought Him a shilling.
022:020 "Whose likeness and inscription," He asked, "is this?"
022:021 "Caesar's," they replied.  "Pay therefore," He rejoined,
        "what is Caesar's to Caesar; and what is God's to God."
022:022 They heard this, and were astonished; then left Him,
        and went their way.
022:023 On the same day a party of Sadducees came to Him, contending that
        there is no resurrection.  And they put this case to Him.
022:024 "Teacher," they said, "Moses enjoined, `If a man die childless,
        his brother shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.'
022:025 Now we had among us seven brothers.  The eldest of them married,
        but died childless, leaving his wife to his brother.
022:026 So also did the second and the third, down to the seventh,
022:027 till the woman also died, after surviving them all.
022:028 At the Resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will
        she be? for they all married her."
022:029 The reply of Jesus was, "You are in error, through ignorance
        of the Scriptures and of the power of God.
022:030 For in the Resurrection, men neither marry nor are women given
        in marriage, but they are like angels in Heaven.
022:031 But as to the Resurrection of the dead, have you never read
        what God says to you,
022:032 `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
        of Jacob'?  He is not the God of dead, but of living men."
022:033 All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement
        at His teaching.
022:034 Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He had
        silenced the Sadducees,
022:035 and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as
        a test question,
022:036 "Teacher, which is the greatest Commandment in the Law?"
022:037 "`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'" He answered, "`with thy
        whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind.'
022:038 This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.
022:039 And the second is similar to it:  `Thou shalt love thy fellow
        man as much as thyself.'
022:040 The whole of the Law and the Prophets is summed up in
        these two Commandments."
022:041 While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put
        a question to them.
022:042 "What think you about the Christ," He said, "whose son
        is He?"  "David's," they replied.
022:043 "How then," He asked, "does David, taught by the Spirit,
        call Him Lord, when he says,
022:044 "`The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I
        have put thy foes beneath thy feet'?
022:045 "If therefore David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?"
022:046 No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any
        one venture again to put a question to Him.
023:001 Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.
023:002 "The Scribes," He said, "and the Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses.
023:003 Therefore do and observe everything that they command you;
        but do not imitate their lives, for though they tell others
        what to do, they do not do it themselves.
023:004 Heavy and cumbrous burdens they bind together and load men's
        shoulders with them, while as for themselves, not with one
        finger do they choose to lift them.
023:005 And everything they do they do with a view to being observed by men;
        for they widen their phylacteries and make the tassels large,
023:006 and love the best seats at a dinner party or in the synagogues,
023:007 and like to be bowed to in places of public resort, and to be
        addressed by men as `Rabbi.'
023:008 "As for you, do not accept the title of `Rabbi,' for one alone
        is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
023:009 And call no one on earth your Father, for One alone is your Father--
        the Heavenly Father.
023:010 And do not accept the name of `leader,' for your Leader is
        one alone--the Christ.
023:011 He who is the greatest among you shall be your servant;
023:012 and one who exalts himself shall be abased, while one who abases
        himself shall be exalted.
023:013 "But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you
        lock the door of the Kingdom of the Heavens against men;
        you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those to enter
        who are seeking to do so.
023:014 []
023:015 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you scour
        sea and land in order to win one convert--and when he is gained,
        you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.
023:016 "Alas for you, you blind guides, who say, "`Whoever swears
        by the Sanctuary it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold
        of the Sanctuary, is bound by the oath.'
023:017 "Blind fools!  Why, which is greater?--the gold, or the Sanctuary
        which has made the gold holy?
023:018 And you say, "`Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing;
        but whoever swears by the offering lying on it is bound
        by the oath.'
023:019 "You are blind!  Why, which is greater?--the offering,
        or the altar which makes the offering holy?
023:020 He who swears by the altar swears both by it and by everything on it;
023:021 he who swears by the Sanctuary swears both by it and by Him
        who dwells in it;
023:022 and he who swears by Heaven swears both by the throne of God
        and by Him who sits upon it.
023:023 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay
        the tithe on mint, dill, and cumin, while you have neglected
        the weightier requirements of the Law--just judgement, mercy,
        and faithful dealing.  These things you ought to have done,
        and yet you ought not to have left the others undone.
023:024 You blind guides, straining out the gnat while you gulp
        down the camel!
023:025 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you
        wash clean the outside of the cup or dish, while within they
        are full of greed and self-indulgence.
023:026 Blind Pharisee, first wash clean the inside of the cup or dish,
        and then the outside will be clean also.
023:027 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are
        just like whitewashed sepulchres, the outside of which pleases
        the eye, though inside they are full of dead men's bones
        and of all that is unclean.
023:028 The same is true of you:  outwardly you seem to the human
        eye to be good and honest men, but, within, you are full
        of insincerity and disregard of God's Law.
023:029 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you repair
        the sepulchres of the Prophets and keep in order the tombs
        of the righteous,
023:030 and your boast is, "`If we had lived in the time of our forefathers,
        we should not have been implicated with them in the murder
        of the Prophets.'
023:031 "So that you bear witness against yourselves that you are
        descendants of those who murdered the Prophets.
023:032 Fill up the measure of your forefathers' guilt.
023:033 O serpents, O vipers' brood, how are you to escape
        condemnation to Gehenna?
023:034 "For this reason I am sending to you Prophets and wise men
        and Scribes.  Some of them you will put to death--nay, crucify;
        some of them you will flog in your synagogues and chase
        from town to town;
023:035 that all the innocent blood shed upon earth may come on you,
        from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah
        the son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the Sanctuary
        and the altar.
023:036 I tell you in solemn truth that all these things will come
        upon the present generation.
