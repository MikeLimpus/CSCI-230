     _If it's too impossibly difficult to track down and recapture an
     escaped criminal ... there's a worse thing one might do...._


[Illustration]

JULY 18, 1949 A.D.

_The fugitive lay face down in the fetid undergrowth, drawing in
spasmodic lungfuls of air through cracked and swollen lips. Long before,
his blue workshirt had been ripped to ribbons and his exposed chest
showed a spiderwork of scratches, where branches and brambles had sought
to restrain him in his frenzied flight. Across his back from shoulder to
shoulder ran a deeper cut around which the caked blood attested to the
needle-sharp viciousness of a thorn bush a mile to the north. With each
tortured breath he winced, as drops of sweat ran down, following the
spiderwork network and burning like acid. Incessantly he rubbed his
bruised torso with mud-caked palms to dislodge the gnats and mosquitoes
that clung to him, gorging shamelessly._

_To the east he could see the lights of Fort Mudge where the railroad
cut through on its way to Jacksonville. He had planned to ride the
freight into Jacksonville but by now they were stopping every train and
searching along every foot of the railroad right of way. In the distance
he heard the eerie keen of a train whistle, and visualized the scene as
it was flagged down and searched from engine to caboose._

_Directly before him loomed the forbidding northern boundary of the
Okefenokee Swamp. Unconsciously he strained his ears, then shuddered at
the night noises that issued from the noisome wilderness. A frenzied
threshing, then a splash, then ... silence. What drama of life and death
was being played out in that strange other-world of perpetual shadows?_

_In sudden panic he jerked erect and cupped his palm round his ear. Far
off; muted by distance, but still unmistakable; he heard the baying of
bloodhounds. Then this was the end. A sob broke from his throat. What
was he, an animal; to be hunted down as a sport? Tears of self-pity
welled to his eyes as he thought back to a party and a girl and laughter
and cleanliness and the scent of magnolias, like a heady wine. But that
was so long ago--so long ago--and now.... He looked down at his
sweating, lacerated body; his blistered calloused palms; the black
broken nails; the cheap workshoes with hemp laces; the shapeless gray
cotton trousers, now wet to the knees._

_He pulled back his shoulders and resolutely faced west toward the
river, but stopped short in horror as he heard the sudden cacophony of
barks, yelps and howls of a pack of bloodhounds that senses the
beginning of the end. He turned in panic. They couldn't be over half a
mile away. In a panic of indecision he turned first east then west, then
facing due south he hesitated a moment to take one last look at the
clear open skies, and with a muffled prayer plunged into the brooding
depths of the Okefenokee._

JUNE 13, 427th Year GALACTIC ERA

The building still hummed and vibrated with the dying echoes of the
alarm siren as the biophysicist hurried down the corridor, and without
breaking stride, pushed open the door to the Director's office.

The Director shuffled the papers before him and sighed heavily. His
chair creaked protestingly as he shifted his bulk and looked up.

"Well?"

"He got away clean," said the biophysicist.

"Any fix on the direction?"

"None at all, sir. And he's got at least a two hours' start. That takes
in a pretty big area of space."

"Hm-m-m! Well there's just a bare chance. That experimental cruiser is
the fastest thing in space and it's equipped with the latest
ethero-radar. If we get started right away, we just might--"

"That's just it," interrupted the biophysicist. "That's the ship he got
away in."

The Director jumped angrily to his feet. "How did that happen? How can I
explain to the board?"

"I'm sorry, sir. He was just too--"

"_You're_ sorry?" He slumped back in his chair and drummed the desk top
with his fingernails, worrying his lower lip with his teeth. He exhaled
loudly and leaned forward. "Well, only one thing to do. You know the
orders."

The biophysicist squirmed uncomfortably. "Couldn't we send a squadron of
ships out to search and--"

"And what?" asked the Director, sarcastically. "You don't think I'd risk
a billion credits worth of equipment on a wild-goose chase like that, do
you? We could use up a year's appropriation of fuel and manpower and
still be unable to adequately search a sector one-tenth that size. If he
just sat still, a thousand ships couldn't find him in a thousand years,
searching at finite speeds. Add to that the fact that the target is
moving at ultra-light speed and the odds against locating him is
multiplied by a billion."

"I know, but he can't stay in space. He'll have to land somewhere,
sometime."

"True enough--but where and when?"

"Couldn't we alert all the nearby planets?"

"You know better than that. He could be halfway across the galaxy before
an ethero-gram reached the nearest planet."

"Suppose we sent scout ships to the nearer planets and asked them to
inform their neighbors in the same way. We'd soon have an expanding
circle that he _couldn't_ slip through."

The Director smiled wryly. "Maybe. But who's going to pay for all this.
By the time the circle was a thousand light-years in diameter there
would be ten thousand ships and a million clerks working on recapturing
one escaped prisoner. Another thing; I don't know offhand what he's been
sentenced for, but I'll wager there are ten thousand planets on which
his crime would not be a crime. Do you think we could ever extradite him
from such a planet? And even if by some incredible stroke of fortune one
of our agents happened to land on the right planet, in which city would
he begin his search. Or suppose our quarry lands only on uninhabited
planets? We can't very well alert the whole galaxy in the search for
just one man."

"I know, but--"

"But what?" interrupted the Director. "Any other suggestions?"

"N ... no--"

"All right, he asked for it. You have the pattern, I presume. _Feed it
to Fido!_"

"Yes, sir, but well ... I just don't--"

"Do you think _I_ like it?" asked the Director, fiercely.

In the silence that followed, they looked at each other, guiltily.

"There's nothing else we can do," said the Director. "The orders are
explicit. _No one escapes from Hades!_"

"I know," replied the biophysicist. "I'm not blaming you. Only I wish
someone else had my job."

"Well," said the Director, heavily. "You might as well get started." He
nodded his head in dismissal.

As the biophysicist went out the door, the Director looked down once
more at the pile of papers before him. He pulled the top sheet closer,
and rubber-stamped across its face--CASE CLOSED.

"Yes," he mused aloud. "Closed for us, but--" He hesitated a moment, and
then sighing once more, signed his name in the space provided.

AUGUST 6, 430th Year GALACTIC ERA

Tee Ormond sat morosely at the spaceport bar, and alternately wiped his
forehead with a soggy handkerchief, and sipped at his frosted rainbow,
careful not to disturb the varicolored layers of liquid in the tall
narrow glass. Every now and then he nervously ran his fingers through
his straight black hair, which lay damply plastered to his head. His
jacket was faded and worn, and above the left pocket was emblazoned the
meteor insignia of the spaceman. A dark patch on his back showed where
the perspiration had seeped through. He blinked and rubbed the corner of
his eye as a drop of perspiration ran down and settled there.

A casual look would have classified him as a very average looking pilot
such as could be found at the bar of any spaceport; i.e. if space pilots
can ever be classified as average. Spacemen are the last true
adventurers in an age where the debilitating culture of a highly
mechanized civilization has pushed to the very borders of the galaxy.
While most men are fearful and indecisive outside their narrow
specialties the spacemen must at all times be ready to deal with the
unexpected and the unusual. The expression--"Steady as a spaceman's
nerves"--had a very real origin.

A closer look at Tee would have revealed the error of a quick
classification. He gripped his drink too tightly, and his eyes darted
restlessly from side to side, as though searching, searching; yet
dreading to find the object of their search. His expressive face
contorted in a nervous tic each time his eyes swept by the clock hanging
behind the bar. He glanced dispiritedly out the window at the
perpetually cloudy sky and idly watched a rivulet of water race down the
dirty pane. He loosened his collar and futilely mopped at his neck with
the soggy handkerchief, then irritably flung it to the floor.

"Hey, Jo," he yelled to the bartender. "What's the matter with the
air-conditioning? I'm burning up."

"Take it easy," soothed the bartender, consulting a thermometer on the
wall behind him, "it's eighty-five in here. That's as low as the law
allows. Can't have too much difference in the temperature or all my
customers'd pass out when they go outside. Why don't you go into town?
They keep it comfortable under the dome."

"Don't this planet _ever_ cool off?" asked Tee.

The bartender chuckled. "I see you don't know too much about Thymis.
Sometimes it drops to ninety at night, but not too often. You ought to
be here sometime when the clouds part for a minute. If you're caught
outside then, it's third-degree burns for sure."

He glanced down at the nearly empty glass. "How about another rainbow?
If you get enough of them in you, you won't notice the heat--you won't
notice anything." He laughed uproariously at the hoary joke.

       *       *       *       *       *

Tee looked at him disgustedly and without answering bent to his drink
once more. He felt someone jostle his elbow and turned sideways to allow
the newcomer access to the bar. After a moment he wiped his forehead on
his sleeve. The bartender placed another rainbow before him.

"Hey, I didn't order that," he cried.

The bartender nodded toward the next stool. "On him."

Tee turned and saw a barrel-chested red-haired giant holding up a drink
in the immemorial bar toast. He raised his own glass gingerly, but his
trembling hand caused the layers to mix and he stared ruefully at the
resultant clayey-looking mess.

The redhead laughed. "Mix another one, Jo."

"But--" Tee's face got red.

"I came in here to talk to you anyway," said the giant. "You own the
_Starduster_, don't you?"

"Yeah, what about it?"

"Like to get her out of hock?"

"Who says she's in hock?"

"Look," said the redhead. "Let's not kid each other. Everybody around
this port knows you blew in from Lemmyt last month and can't raise the
money to pay the port charges, much less the refueling fee. And it's no
secret that you're anxious to leave our fair planet." He winked
conspiringly at Tee.

"So?"

The redhead glanced at the bartender who was busy at the other end of
the bar. He leaned closer and whispered. "I know where the _Elen of
Troy_ is."

"The _Elen of Troy_?"

"Oh, that's right, you wouldn't know about her. Eight months ago she
crashed on an uninhabited planet somewhere in this sector. So far
they've been unable to find her." He leaned closer. "She was carrying
four million in Penryx crystals."

"What's that to me?"

The redhead looked around briefly to make sure no one was in hearing
distance, then whispered softly, without moving his lips. "I told you,
they can't find her, but _I_ know where she is."

"_You_ know? But how--"

"Look," said the giant, frowning, "I didn't ask you why _you're_ so
anxious to leave."

"Well?"

"I'll clear your ship and we can pick up the crystals for the salvage
fee. A million each, and all nice and legal. We can leave by the end of
the week and be back in probably six months."

"_Six months!_" Tee stood up. "Sorry!"

The redhead grabbed his arm in a hamlike palm. "A million each in six
months; what's wrong with that?"

Tee jerked out of his grasp. "I ... I just can't do it."

"I don't know what you're running from," persisted the redhead, "but
with a million credits you can fight extradition for the rest of your
life. This is your big chance, can't you see that. Besides, this planet
has some interesting customs." He winked at Tee. "I can introduce you--"

"I can't stay here," interrupted Tee. "You just don't understand."

"Look," cried the redhead exasperatedly, "I'm offering you a full
partnership on a two million credit salvage deal and you want to back
out because it'll take six months. On top of that you're broke and
stranded and your hangar bill gets bigger every day. If you don't take
me up on this deal, you'll still be sitting here six months from now
wondering how to get your ship out of hock--if you don't get caught
first. What do you say? What've you got to lose?"

What did he have to lose? Tee gripped the edge of the bar till his
knuckles showed white. "No! I just can't do it. Why don't you get
someone else?"

"The slow tubs around this port would take years for the trip. I can see
the _Starduster_ has class."

"Fastest thing in the galaxy," said Tee, proudly. Then earnestly, "I'm
sorry, you'll just have to find some other ship."

"Think it over," said the redhead. "I'll wait. When you change your mind
look me up. Name's Yule Larson." He slapped Tee heavily on the back and
swaggered toward the door. He turned and looked back. "Better go along
with me. After six months they can auction off your ship to pay for the
port charges, you know." The door swung shut behind him.

       *       *       *       *       *

Tee sat down again and bent his head, nursing his drink. His eyes darted
nervously around the room and came to rest on the clock. A shudder ran
through him and he lowered his eyes quickly. As he sipped his drink his
eyes returned to the clock continually, as though drawn there against
their will. As he watched, the minute hand jerked downward and an
involuntary gasp escaped his lips.

The bartender turned quickly. "Anything wrong?"

"N ... no, nothing." As he spoke, the minute hand moved again and Tee
started nervously, upsetting his drink. He sat for a moment watching the
bartender mop up the spreading liquid, then abruptly got up and tossed a
half-credit piece on the bar. He hurried outside, steeling himself to
keep from running. He paused just outside the door.

_Stand still_, he told himself. _Mustn't run! Mustn't run! No use
anyway. If I only knew when. If I just could stop and rest. If I had the
time ... Time! Time! That's what I need. Light-years of time ... But
when? When? If only I could be sure._ He looked up slowly at the murky
canopy of clouds. _If I only knew when!_ He looked indecisively up and
down the field, then squaring his shoulders resolutely, set out for the
administration building.

Andrews full sume, & this, it is nere 700^li. M^r. Beachamp he demands
400^li.
and we all know that, if a man demands money, he must shew wherfore,
and make proofe of his debte; which I know he can never make good
proafe of one hunderd pound dew unto him as principall money; so
till he can, you have good reason to keep y^e 500^li.

&c. This I proteste I write not in malice against M^r.

Beachamp, for it is a reall truth.

You may partly see it by M^r.

Andrews making up his accounte, and I think you are all perswaded I
can say more then M^r.

Andrews concerning that accounte. I wish I could make up my owne
as plaine & easily, but because of former discontents, I will be
sparing till I be called; & you may injoye y^e 500^li. quietly till
he begine; for let him take his course hear or ther, it shall be
all one, I will doe him no wronge; and if he have not on peney more,
he is less loser then either M^r.

Andrews or I. This I conceive to be just & honest; y^e having or not
having of his release matters not; let him make such proafe of his debte
as you cannot disprove, and according to your first agreemente you
will pay it, &c.

Your truly affectioned friend, JAMES SHERLEY.

London, Aprill 27. 1643.

_Anno Dom: 1643._

I am to begine this year whith that which was a mater of great
saddnes and mo[=u]ring unto them all. Aboute y^e 18. of Aprill dyed
their Reve^d Elder, and my dear & loving friend, M^r. William Brewster;
a man that had done and suffered much for y^e Lord Jesus and y^e
gospells sake, and had bore his parte in well and woe with this poore
persecuted church above 36. years [254] in England, Holand, and
in this wildernes, and done y^e Lord & them faithfull service in
his place & calling.

And notwithstanding y^e many troubls and sorrows he passed throw,
the Lord upheld him to a great age.

He was nere fourskore years of age (if not all out) when he dyed. He had
this blesing added by y^e Lord to all y^e rest, to dye in his bed,
in peace, amongst y^e mids of his freinds, who mourned & wepte over
him, and ministered what help & comforte they could unto him, and
he againe recomforted them whilst he could.

His sicknes was not long, and till y^e last day therof he did not wholy
keepe his bed. His speech continued till somewhat more then halfe a
day, & then failed him; and aboute 9. or 10. a clock that ev[=i]ng he
dyed, without any pangs at all. A few howers before, he drew his breath
shorte, and some few minuts before his last, he drew his breath long,
as a man falen into a sound slepe, without any pangs or gaspings,
and so sweetly departed this life unto a better.

I would now demand of any, what he was y^e worse for any former
sufferings?

       What doe I say, worse?

Nay, sure he was y^e better, and they now added to his honour.

_It is a manifest token_ (saith y^e Apostle, 2.
Thes: 1. 5, 6, 7.) _of y^e righeous judgmente of God that you may be counted
worthy of y^e kingdome of God, for which ye allso suffer; seing
it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them
y^t trouble you: and to you who are troubled, rest with us, when
y^e Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty
angels._ 1.

Pet. 4.
14. _If you be reproached for y^e name of Christ, hapy are ye, for y^e
spirite of glory and of God resteth upon you._ What though he
wanted y^e riches and pleasurs of y^e world in this life, and pompous
monuments at his funurall?

yet y^e memoriall of y^e just shall be blessed, when y^e name of
y^e wicked shall rott (with their marble monuments).

Pro: 10. 7.

I should say something of his life, if to say a litle were not worse
then to be silent.

But I cannot wholy forbear, though hapily more may be done hereafter.
After he had attained some learning, viz. y^e knowledg of y^e
Latine tongue, & some insight in y^e Greeke, and spent some small
time at Cambridge, and then being first seasoned with y^e seeds of
grace and vertue, he went to y^e Courte, and served that religious
and godly gentlman, M^r.

Davison, diverce years, when he was Secretary of State; who found
him so discreete and faithfull as he trusted him above all other
that were aboute him, and only imployed him in all matters of
greatest trust and secrecie.

He esteemed him rather as a sonne then a servante, and for his
wisdom & godlines (in private) he would converse with him more like
a freind & familier then a maister.

He attended his m^r. when he was sente in ambassage by the Queene
into y^e Low-Countries, in y^e Earle of Leicesters time, as for
other waighty affaires of state, so to receive possession of the
cautionary townes, and in token & signe therof the keyes of Flushing
being delivered to him, in her ma^tis name, he kepte them some time,
and co[=m]itted them to this his servante, who kept them under his
pilow, on which he slepte y^e first night.

And, at his returne, y^e States honoured him with a gould chaine, and his
maister co[=m]itted it to him, and co[=m]anded him to wear it when
they arrived in England, as they ridd thorrow the country,
till they came to y^e Courte. He afterwards remained with him till his
troubles, that he was put from his place aboute y^e death of y^e
Queene of Scots; and some good time after, doeing him manie faithfull
offices of servise in y^e time of his troubles.

Afterwards he wente and lived in y^e country, in good esteeme amongst
his freinds and y^e gentle-men of those parts, espetially the godly
& religious.

He did much good in y^e countrie wher he lived, in promoting and furthering
religion, not only by his practiss & example, and provocking and
incouraging of others, but by procuring of good preachers to y^e
places theraboute, and, drawing on of others to assiste & help
forward in such a worke; he him selfe most comonly deepest in y^e
charge, & some times above his abillitie.

And in this state he continued many years, doeing y^e best good
he could, and walking according to y^e light he saw, till y^e Lord
reveiled further unto him. And in y^e end, by y^e tirrany of y^e bishops
against godly preachers & people, in silenceing the one & persecuting
y^e other, he and many more of those times begane to looke further
into things, and to see into y^e unlawfullnes of their callings,
and y^e burthen of many anti-christian corruptions, which both he
and they endeavored to cast of; as y^ey allso did, as in y^e begining
of this treatis is to be seene. [255] After they were joyned togither
in comunion, he was a spetiall stay & help unto them.

They ordinarily mett at his house on y^e Lords day, (which was a
manor of y^e bishops,) and with great love he entertained them when
they came, making provission for them to his great charge.

He was y^e cheefe of those that were taken at Boston, and suffered
y^e greatest loss; and of y^e seven that were kept longst in prison,
and after bound over to y^e assises.

Affter he came into Holland he suffered much hardship, after he had
spente y^e most of his means, haveing a great charge, and many
children; and, in regard of his former breeding & course of life,
not so fitt for many imployments as others were, espetially such
as were toylesume & laborious.

But yet he ever bore his condition with much cherfullnes and
contentation.

Towards y^e later parte of those 12. years spente in Holland, his
outward condition was mended, and he lived well & plentifully; for
he fell into a way (by reason he had y^e Latine tongue) to teach
many students, who had a disire to lerne y^e English tongue, to
teach them English; and by his method they quickly attained it with
great facilitie; for he drew rules to lerne it by, after y^e Latine
maner; and many gentlemen, both Danes & Germans, resorted to him,
as they had time from other studies, some of them being great mens
so[=n]es.

He also had means to set up printing, (by y^e help of some freinds,)
and so had imploymente inoughg, and by reason of many books which
would not be alowed to be printed in England, they might have had
more then they could doe.

But now removeing into this countrie, all these things were laid
aside againe, and a new course of living must be framed unto; in
which he was no way unwilling to take his parte, and to bear his
burthen with y^e rest, living many times without bread, or corne,
many months together, having many times nothing but fish, and often
wanting that also; and drunke nothing but water for many years
togeather, yea, till within 5. or 6. years of his death.

And yet he lived (by y^e blessing of God) in health till very old
age.

And besids y^t, he would labour with his hands in y^e feilds as
long as he was able; yet when the church had no other minister, he
taught twise every Saboth, and y^t both powerfully and profitably,
to y^e great contentment of y^e hearers, and their comfortable
edification; yea, many were brought to God by his ministrie.

He did more in this behalfe in a year, then many that have their
hundreds a year doe in all their lives. For his personall abilities,
he was qualified above many; he was wise and discreete and well
spoken, having a grave & deliberate utterance, of a very cherfull
spirite, very sociable & pleasante amongst his freinds, of an humble
and modest mind, of a peaceable disposition, under vallewing him
self & his owne abilities, and some time over valewing others;
inoffencive and i[=n]ocente in his life & conversation, w^ch gained
him y^e love of those without, as well as those within; yet he would
tell them plainely of their faults & evills, both publickly &
privatly, but in such a maner as usually was well taken from him.

He was tender harted, and compassionate of such as were in miserie,
but espetialy of such as had been of good estate and ranke, and
were fallen unto want & poverty, either for goodnes & religions
sake, or by y^e injury & oppression of others; he would say, of all
men these deserved to be pitied most.

And none did more offend & displease him then such as would hautily and
proudly carry & lift up themselves, being rise from nothing, and haveing
litle els in them to comend them but a few fine cloaths, or a litle
riches more then others.

In teaching, he was very moving & stirring of affections, also very
plaine & distincte in what he taught; by which means he became y^e
more profitable to y^e hearers.

He had a singuler good gift in prayer, both publick & private,
in ripping up y^e hart & conscience before God, in the humble confession
of sinne, and begging y^e mercies of God in Christ for y^e pardon of
y^e same.

He always thought it were better for ministers to pray oftener, and
devide their prears, then be longe & tedious in the same (excepte
upon sollemne & spetiall occations, as in days of humiliation & y^e
like).

       His reason was, that y^e harte & spirits of all, espetialy y^e
weake, could hardly continue & stand bente (as it were) so long
towards God, as they ought to doe in y^t duty, without flagging and
falling of.

For y^e govermente of y^e church, (which was most [256] proper to his
office,) he was carfull to preserve good order in y^e same, and to
preserve puritie, both in y^e doctrine & comunion of y^e same; and
to supress any errour or contention that might begine to rise up
amongst them; and accordingly God gave good success to his indeavors
herein all his days, and he saw y^e fruite of his labours in that
behalfe.

But I must breake of, having only thus touched a few, as it were, heads
of things.

I cannot but here take occasion, not only to mention, but greatly
to admire y^e marvelous providence of God, that notwithstanding y^e
many changes and hardships that these people wente throwgh, and y^e
many enemies they had and difficulties they mette with all, that
so many of them should live to very olde age!

It was not only this reve^d mans condition, (for one swallow maks no summer,
as they say,) but many more of them did y^e like, some dying aboute and
before this time, and many still living, who attained to 60. years
of age, and to 65. diverse to 70. and above, and some nere 80. as he
did. It must needs be more then ordinarie, and above naturall reason,
that so it should be; for it is found in experience, that chaing
of aeir, famine, or unholsome foode, much drinking of water, sorrows
& troubls, &c., all of them are enimies to health, causes of many
diseaces, consumers of naturall vigoure and y^e bodys of men, and
shortners of life.

And yet of all these things they had a large parte, and suffered
deeply in y^e same.

They wente from England to Holand, wher they found both worse
air and dyet then that they came from; from thence (induring a long
imprisonmente, as it were, in y^e ships at sea) into New-England;
and how it hath been with them hear hath allready beene showne; and
what crosses, troubls, fears, wants, and sorrowes they had been
lyable unto, is easie to conjecture; so as in some sorte they may
say with y^e Apostle, 2.

Cor: 11. 26, 27.
they were _in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in
perills of robers, in perills of their owne nation, in perils among
y^e heathen, in perills in y^e willdernes, in perills in y^e sea,
in perills among false breethern; in wearines & painfullnes, in
watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in could
and nakednes._ What was it then that upheld them?

It was Gods vissitation that preserved their spirits.

Job 10. 12. _Thou hast given me life and grace, and thy vissitation
hath preserved my spirite._ He that upheld y^e Apostle upheld them. _They
were persecuted, but not forsaken, cast downe, but perished not._ 2.

Cor: 4. 9. _As unknowen, and yet knowen; as dying, and behold we
live; as chastened, and yett not kiled._ 2.

Cor: 6. 9. God, it seems, would have all men to behold and observe such
mercies and works of his providence as these are towards his people, that
they in like cases might be incouraged to depend upon God in their
trials, & also blese his name when they see his goodnes towards
others.

Man lives not by bread only, Deut: 8. 3.

It is not by good & dainty fare, by peace, & rest, and harts ease, in
injoying y^e contentments and good things of this world only, that
preserves health and prolongs life.

God in such examples would have y^e world see & behold that he can
doe it without them; and if y^e world will shut ther eyes, and take
no notice therof, yet he would have his people to see and consider
it.

Daniell could be better liking with pulse then others were with y^e kings
dainties. Jaacob, though he wente from one nation to another people,
and passed thorow famine, fears, & many afflictions, yet he lived
till old age, and dyed sweetly, & rested in y^e Lord, as infinite
others of Gods servants have done, and still shall doe, (through
Gods goodnes,) notwithstanding all y^e malice of their enemies;
_when y^e branch of y^e wicked shall be cut of before his day_,
Job. 15. 32.

_and the bloody and deceitfull men shall not live out halfe their days_.
Psa: 55. 23.

By reason of y^e plottings of the Narigansets, (ever since y^e
Pequents warr,) the Indeans were drawne into a generall conspiracie
against y^e English in all parts, as was in part discovered y^e
yeare before; and now made more plaine and evidente by many discoveries
and free-conffessions of sundrie Indeans (upon severall occasions)
from diverse places, concuring in one; with such other concuring
circomstances as gave them suffissently to understand the trueth
therof, and to thinke of means, how to prevente y^e same, and secure
them selves.

Which made them enter into this more nere union & confederation
following.

[257] Articles of Confederation betweene y^e Plantations under y^e
Govermente of Massachusets, y^e Plantations under y^e Govermente
of New-Plimoth, y^e Plantations under y^e Govermente of Conightecute,
and y^e Govermente of New-Haven, with y^e Plantations in combination
therwith.

Wheras we all came into these parts of America with one and y^e
same end and aime, namly; to advance the kingdome of our Lord Jesus
Christ, & to injoye y^e liberties of y^e Gospell in puritie with
peace; and wheras in our setling (by a wise providence of God) we
are further disperced upon y^e sea coasts and rivers then was at
first intended, so y^t we cannot, according to our desires, with
convenience comunicate in one govermente & jurisdiction; and wheras
we live encompassed with people of severall nations and strang
languages, which hereafter may prove injurious to us and our
posteritie; and for as much as y^e natives have formerly committed
sundrie insolencies and outrages upon severall plantations of y^e
English, and have of late combined them selves against us; and
seeing, by reason of those distractions in England (which they have
heard of) and by which they know we are hindered from y^t humble
way of seeking advice or reaping those comfurtable fruits of
protection which at other times we might well expecte; we therfore
doe conceive it our bounden duty, without delay, to enter into a
presente consociation amongst our selves, for mutuall help & strength
in all our future concernments.

That as in nation and religion, so in other respects, we be &
continue one, according to y^e tenor and true meaning of the insuing
articles. (1) Wherfore it is fully agreed and concluded by & betweene
y^e parties or jurisdictions above named, and they joyntly & severally
doe by these presents agree & conclude, that they all be and
henceforth be called by y^e name of The United Colonies of
New-England.

2.

The said United Collonies, for them selves & their posterities, doe
joyntly & severally hereby enter into a firme & perpetuall league
of frendship & amitie, for offence and defence, mutuall advice and
succore upon all just occasions, both for preserving & propagating
y^e truth of y^e Gospell, and for their owne mutuall saftie and
wellfare.

3.

It is further agreed that the plantations which at presente are or
hereafter shall be setled with[in] y^e limites of y^e Massachusets
shall be for ever under y^e Massachusets, and shall have peculier
jurisdiction amonge them selves in all cases, as an intire body.

And y^t Plimoth, Conightecutt, and New-Haven shall each of them
have like peculier jurisdition and govermente within their limites
and in refference to y^e plantations which allready are setled, or
shall hereafter be erected, or shall setle within their limites,
respectively; provided y^t no other jurisdition shall hereafter be
taken in, as a distincte head or member of this confederation, nor
shall any other plantation or jurisdiction in presente being, and
not allready in combination or under y^e jurisdiction of any of
these confederats, be received by any of them; nor shall any tow
of y^e confederats joyne in one jurisdiction, without consente of
y^e rest, which consete to be interpreted as is expresed in y^e
sixte article ensewing.

"But ... but I thought--" She looked down.

He reached out and gently touched her cheek. "Can't you see I _want_ to
stay?" he pleaded.

"Then why? Why?" She was crying now.

"I ... I just can't. It's no good." He stood up.

She reached out and caught his hand. "Then take me with you. I've heard
you at night pacing in your room. I don't know what it is that drives
you on and on, but if space is what you want, let me go with you. I can
help you, darling. You'll see. And some day when you grow tired of
space, we can come back to Elysia." She was babbling now.

He pulled roughly away. "No! It's no good. I'm--If only I _could_
stay." He brushed her hair softly with his palm and as she reached out
toward him he turned and walked swiftly toward the house, pitying and
hating himself by turn, while Lara sat forlornly by the pool looking
after him.

He began to sweat before he reached the house and his knees began to
tremble so, he had to stop for a moment, to keep his balance.
Determinedly he started forward again and continued on past the house to
the highway that wound by half a kilometer away. There he hailed a
passing ground car and rode to the spaceport, where a few judiciously
distributed credits facilitated his immediate clearance. Before the ship
had even left the atmosphere he rammed in the subspace control.

MAY 4, 437th Year GALACTIC ERA

Tantalus lay far out on a spiral arm, well away from the main stream of
traffic that flowed through the galaxy. It was a fair planet boasting an
equable climate, at least in the tropic zone. But as yet the population
was small, consisting mostly of administrative officials who served
their alloted time and thankfully returned to their home planets closer
to the center of population.

Tee entered the towering building and after consulting a wall directory
stepped into the antigrav chute and was whisked high up into the heart
of the building. He stepped out before a plain door and as he advanced
the center panel fluoresced briefly with the printed legend--GALACTIC
PRISON AUTHORITY, Ary Mefford, Administrator for Tantalus.

He hesitated for a moment, then squaring his shoulders stepped forward,
and as he crossed the beam the door swung open before him. The
gray-haired man sitting at the desk studying a paper, looked up and
smiled politely. He indicated a chair with a nod then bent his head
again. After a moment he shoved the paper aside and looked questioningly
at Tee.

"I want to give myself up," blurted Tee.

"I'm the administrator for Hades," said the man calmly. "I think you
want the _local_ authorities."

"You don't understand. I escaped from Hades."

"No one escapes from Hades," replied the administrator.

"_I_ escaped!" insisted Tee. "Ten years ago. You can check. I'm tired of
running. I want to go back."

"This is most unusual," said the administrator in a disturbed voice. He
looked unbelievingly at Tee. "_Ten years_ ago you say?"

"_Yes! Yes!_ And I'm ready to go back, before it's too late. Can't you
understand?"

The administrator shook his head pityingly. "It's already too late. I'm
sorry." He bent his head guiltily and began to fumble with the papers on
his desk.

Tee started to say something, but the administrator raised his head and
said slowly, "It was too late the day you left Hades. Nothing I can
do." He looked down again. Tee turned and slowly walked out the door.
The administrator didn't look up.

As Tee walked aimlessly down the deserted corridor, his footsteps echoed
hollowly like a dirge. A line from an old poem sprang to his mind: "We
are the dead, row on row we lie--" He was the dead, but still he chased
the chimera of hope, yet knowing in his heart it was hopeless.

JUNE 11, 437th Year GALACTIC ERA

The _Starduster_, pocked and pitted from innumerable collisions with
dust particles, sped out and out. The close-packed suns of the central
hub lay far behind. Here at the rim of the galaxy the stars lay
scattered, separated by vast distances. _Pallor ex ægritudine._ When
sickness of stomach first occurs, a paleness of the skin attends it;
which is owing to the association or catenation between the
capillaries of the stomach and the cutaneous ones; which at first
act by direct sympathy.

On and on past the thinning stars raced the patient electronic
bloodhound; invisible, irreversible, indestructible; slowly, but
inexorably accelerating. Which may be accounted for by the communication
of a lymphatic branch with the gastric branch of the vena portarum, as
discovered by J. F. Meckel. See Section XXVII. 2.

M. M. Alum. Earth of Alum. Cantharides. Calomel. Bark. Steel. Rosin.
Opium.It was quite mindless, and the final pattern its
meshing would create would be something quite strange, and not very
human.
