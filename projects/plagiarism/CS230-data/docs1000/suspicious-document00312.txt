     DR. Cross the ocean, and you
     will find the same testimony,
     that
     mental culture is
     absolutely favorable to physical
     endurance.
     The greatest men in
     our nation's history,
     whether in walks
     of statesmanship,
     science, or literature,
     almost without exception,
     have lived long. Franklin,
     Washington, Jefferson,
     Madison, the elder
     Adams, and Patrick Henry,
     in earlier
     periods,--the
     younger Adams, Clay, Calhoun, Webster,
     Choate, and Everett, Irving, Prescott, Cooper, and Hawthorne, in
later times,--are cases in point.

These men did not die prematurely.

They grew strong by the toil of the brain. And to-day the quartette of
our truest poets--Bryant, Whittier, Longfellow, and Holmes--are with
us in the hale years of a green age, never singing sweeter songs, never
harping more inspiring strains. Long may our ears hear their melodies!

* * * * *
If now we could enter the walks of private life, and study widely the
experience of individual men, we should have an interesting record indeed,
and a manifold and wellnigh irresistible testimony. Consider a few
remarkable, yet widely differing cases.

Who can read attentively the life of John Wesley, and not exclaim, if
varied and exhausting labor, if perpetual excitement and constant
drafts upon the brain, would ever wear a man out, he would have worn
out? It was his creative energy that called into existence a denomination,
his ardent piety that inspired it, his clear mind that legislated for
it, his heroic industry that did no mean part of the incessant daily toil
needful for its establishment. Yet this man of many labors, who through
a long life never knew practically the meaning of the word _leisure_,
says, at seventy-two, "How is it that I find the same strength that I
did thirty years ago, that my nerves are firmer, that I have none
of the infirmities of old age, and have lost several that I had in youth."
And ten years later, he devoutly records, "Is anything too hard for God?
It is now eleven years since I have felt such a thing as weariness." And
he continued till eighty-eight in full possession of his faculties, laboring
with body and mind alike to within a week of his death.

Joseph Priestley was certainly a very different man, but scarcely
less remarkable. No mean student in all branches of literature, a
metaphysician, a theologian, a man of science, he began life with
a feeble frame, and ended a hearty old age at seventy-one.I have been talking of his method and manner; the matter the reader has
here before him; and it is good matter, glad, honest, kind, just.

                                             W.  D.  HOWELLS.


PREFACE

FROM THE PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION OF "MARK TWAIN'S SKETCHES"

If I were to sell the reader a barrel of molasses, and he, instead of
sweetening his substantial dinner with the same at judicious intervals,
should eat the entire barrel at one sitting, and then abuse me for making
him sick, I would say that he deserved to be made sick for not knowing
any better how to utilize the blessings this world affords.  And if I
sell to the reader this volume of nonsense, and he, instead of seasoning
his graver reading with a chapter of it now and then, when his mind
demands such relaxation, unwisely overdoses himself with several chapters
of it at a single sitting, he will deserve to be nauseated, and he will
have nobody to blame but himself if he is.  There is no more sin in
publishing an entire volume of nonsense than there is in keeping a
candy-store with no hardware in it.  The thinker and not the talker is
becoming the leader.

There must be convincing
                                   proof of a good cause
                                                       and of beneficial results before another Indian war is undertaken
under the most favorable circumstances.

                          In territory there is nothing to be gained.

They cling tenaciously to what they have, but they are not grasping
for more, for they realize that their vast hunting grounds have
been lost to them forever.

          The young men and women in going half across the continent to
          Carlisle and Hampton, being educated there and in summer
          homes in the East, come back impressed with the largeness of the
          country, the prosperity and vast numerical superiority
          of the people.
They care not to war against so strong a foe.This is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant
reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I will drop lightly
into history myself.  Standing here on the shore of the Atlantic and
contemplating certain of its largest literary billows, I am reminded of a
thing which happened to me thirteen years ago, when I had just succeeded
in stirring up a little Nevadian literary puddle myself, whose
spume-flakes were beginning to blow thinly Californiaward.  There is an
uprising of the Indians, however, which is being too slowly recognized.
They are slowly but surely rising above superstition and ignorance,
yes, even above indolence. The old roving, restless, tramp-like
spirit has not wholly disappeared.
