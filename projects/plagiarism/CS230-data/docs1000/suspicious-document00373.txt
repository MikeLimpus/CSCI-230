Anna M. Bain.


Meddus to the Rev. Joseph Mead:[3]--"Yesterday being Holy Thursday, one
Pyke, a common soldier, left behind the fleet at Cadiz, delivered a
challenge to the Duke of Buckingham from the Marquis of ----,
brother-in-law to the Conde d'Olivares, in defence of the honour
of his sister; affirming, moreover, that he had wronged Olivares,
the King of Spain, and the King of England, and therefore he would
fight with him in any part of France.

This Pike, a Devonshire man, being presented prisoner to the Duke
of Medina, he would needs have him fight at rapier or dagger with
a Spaniard, supposing he would not stand him two thrusts:
but Pyke, by a dexterous sleight, presently disarmed the Spaniard
of his rapier without hurting him, and presented it to the Duke,"
&c.

As to the authorship of the play, though I should be loth to speak with
positiveness, I feel bound to put forward a claim for Thomas
Heywood.

Through all Heywood's writings there runs a vein of generous
kindliness:
everywhere we see a gentle, benign countenance, radiant with love
and sympathy.

On laying down one of his plays, the reader is inclined to apply to
him Tacitus' judgment of Agricola, "bonum virum facile crederes, magnum
libenter." Now, when we open _Dick of Devonshire_, the naturalness
and simplicity of the first scene at once suggest Heywood's hand.
In the second scene, the spirited eulogy on Drake--
"That glory of his country and Spayne's terror, That wonder of the
land and the seas minyon, _Drake_, of eternall memory--"
and the fine lines descriptive of the Armada are just such as we
might expect from the author of the closing scenes of the second
part of _If you know not me, you know nobody_.

Heywood was fond of stirring adventures: he is quite at home
on the sea, and delights in nothing more than in describing a
sea-fight; witness his _Fortunes by Land and Sea_, and the two parts
of the _Fair Maid of the West_. But the underplot bears even clearer
traces of Heywood's manner. Manuel is one of those characters he loved
to draw--a perfect Christian gentleman, incapable of baseness in word
or deed.

                                                       Few situations could be found more touching than the scene (iii.
3), where Manuel defends with passionate earnestness the honour of
his absent brother, Henrico, and tries to comfort his heart-broken
father.

Heywood dealt in extremes: his characters are, as a rule, either
faultless gentlemen or abandoned scoundrels.

Hence we need not be surprised that Henrico exceeds other villains
in ruffianism as much as his brother, the gentle Manuel, surpasses
ordinary heroes in virtue.

The characters of Henrico's contracted bride, Eleonora, and Catalina,
the good wife of a vicious husband, are drawn tenderly and skilfully.

How unreliable then must be the distorting
lense of human prejudice.

I had a bit of experience during the Civil War which gave me something
of that whole-heartedness necessary to the service of my kind. In the
twilight of a summer evening, making a sharp curve in a road, about a
dozen men confronted me. They were dressed in blue, a color I was not
very partial to at that time. I had read that "he that fights and runs
away may live to fight another day." It occurred to me that he who
would run without fighting might have a still better chance, but the
click of gun locks and an order to surrender changed my mind to
"safety first" and I was a prisoner of the blue-coated cavalry.

The commanding officer who had me in charge (during my visit) was a
Kentucky Colonel. He afterward became a major-general. I looked at him
during the remainder of the war from the narrow standpoint of
prejudice and cherished revenge in my heart for his having exposed me
to the flying bullets of the Confederate pickets, a peril he was not
responsible for and of which he knew nothing until I informed him in
after years.

A few years after the war our barks met upon the same wave of life's
ocean. We became engaged in the same work of reform, I as an advocate
of temperance, he as candidate for the presidency of the United States
on the prohibition ticket. From the warmth of friendship, my prejudice
melted like mist before the morning sun and I found in General Green
Clay Smith a combination of the noblest traits in human character.

Whoever would graduate in the highest franchise of being, and realize
the royalty that comes of partnership with sovereignty, must have
respectfulness of bearing and feeling toward those from whom they
differ. We are greatly creatures of education and environment anyway,
and until we can unlock the alphabet of a life and sum up the
mingling, blending, reciprocal forces that have been playing upon that
life, we have no more right to abuse persons for honest convictions
than we have to blame them for their parentage.

You do not know the forces that have given direction to the lives of
others; if so, you might know why one is a member of this or that
church, this or that political party, why one lives north, another
south, one on the land, another on the sea.

Some of you may differ with me, but I believe if General Grant had
been born in the South, reared and educated in the South, his father
had owned a cotton plantation and many slaves, General Grant would
have been a Confederate General in the Civil War; while Robert E. Lee
if born, reared and educated in New England would have been a Union
General. If my opinion is correct, if all you northern people had
lived down south, and we southern people had lived north, we would
have gotten the better of the conflict instead of you.

If yonder oak, that came from the finest acorn and promised to be the
monarch of the forest, was dwarfed by simply a drop of dew; if yonder
rolling river, bearing its commerce to sea, was turned seaward,
instead of lakeward, by simply a pebble thrown in the fountain-head;
why not have consideration for those whose circumstances and early
training set in motion convictions differing from ours. God did not
intend all the trees to be oaks, or that all the rivers should run in
one direction, but He did intend all to make up at last His one great
purpose.

Thomas F. Marshall in an address many years ago, to illustrate the
differences between people of different sections, said: "If you call a
Mississippian a liar, he will challenge you to a duel; call a
Kentuckian a liar, he will stab you with a bowie-knife or shoot you
down; call an Indianian a liar, he will say, 'You're another;' call a
New Englander a liar, he will say, 'I bet you a dollar you can't prove
it.'"

Mr. Marshall intended his compliment for the Mississippian and
Kentuckian, but really his compliment was to the New Englander. If a
man calls you a liar, and you are not a liar, the manliest thing to do
is to say, "I challenge you, sir, not on to a field of dishonor, where
the better aimed bullet will tell who's a murderer, but I challenge
you out into the sunlight of God's truth where I'll prove myself a man
and you a slanderer."

I use this to show it is not just to look at character or questions
from the narrow standpoint of prejudice.

Then again, we should not judge a person by one trait. There are
persons for whom you may do fifty favors, yet make one mistake and
they will never forgive you. George Dewey went to the Philippine
Islands, remained in the harbor for months, never made a mistake and
returned to this country the naval hero of the world; and never were
so many babies, horses and dogs named for one man in the same length
of time. But one morning the papers came out with the statement that
he had deeded to his wife a piece of property some friends had
presented to him, and within three days after, when his picture was
thrown on a canvas in an opera house in Washington City it was hissed
from the audience, and when later on he dared to allow his name used
as a candidate for the presidency of the United States, we were ready
to smash the hero at once. But we must remember there are very few men
able to withstand the world's praises. Indeed there never was but one
man who could be successfully lionized and that man was Daniel.

Captain Smith of the Titanic was held responsible by public opinion
for the sinking of the great ship and was harshly criticised by the
press. His forty years of faithful, careful service on the sea was
erased by the one mistake. It was a tremendous one, but let it be said
to his credit that experts had declared that a ship with fifteen
air-tight compartments could not sink, that if cut into halves both
ends would ride the sea. The bulk-head was made to withstand any
contact, and Captain Smith never dreamt of danger from icebergs. But
when he saw his idol shattered, he did all a brave seaman could do to
save human lives. When the last life-boat was launched he came upon a
little child who was lost from its parents. He seized a life-belt,
buckled it about his waist and taking the child in his arms, jumped
into the icy ocean. Holding the child above the water with one hand,
he used the other as an oar, and reaching a boat he placed the little
one in the arms of a woman. Then returning to his sinking ship, he
threw off the life-belt and went down to his death. Who knows but in
the great reckoning day, his reward will be "inasmuch as ye did it
unto that little one on the sea, ye did it unto me."

The great Joseph Cook had a reputation that caused many to look upon
him as one who was all brains and no heart. Before meeting Mr. Cook I
was very much prejudiced against him because of what I had heard. I
lectured for a teachers' institute at New Wilmington, Pennsylvania,
when the great preacher was to follow me the next evening. As I was
leaving the county superintendent said to me: "When you reach the main
line Joseph Cook will get off the train which you are to take. I wish
you would speak to him and give him the name of the hotel where I have
reserved a room for him." When I reached the junction, and the great
savage looking lecturer stepped from the train, I said to myself: "You
can go to any hotel you please, I'll tell you nothing."

Some months later I lectured in Cooper Union Hall in New York City.
Just about time to begin the lecture Joseph Cook entered the door and
took a seat just inside. When I had talked about ten minutes, he arose
and passed out. I thought he was not pleased and the incident did not
lessen my unfavorable estimate of the great thinker.

Some three years later Mr. Cook was on our chautauqua program at
Lexington, Kentucky. Doctor W.L. Davidson, superintendent of the
assembly, requested me to call at the hotel and inform our
distinguished visitor of his hour and see to his reaching the
chautauqua grounds. With reluctance I went to the hotel and sent my
card to his room. He ordered me to be shown up to the room at once.
Approaching the door I found it open and Mr. Cook stood facing me. My
impression is that politeness was sacrificed in my haste to explain
that I was sent to inform him as to the hour of his lecture and to
offer to call for him in time to escort him to the grounds.

Extending his hand he said: "Come in and let me make my best bow to
you for the service you have rendered the temperance cause. I heard
you once for about ten minutes in Cooper Union, when I had an
engagement and had to leave. I see you are on the program tomorrow and
I shall be there."

After his first lecture, returning to the hotel I said: "Mr. Cook, if
I can be of any service to you while you are in our city, please feel
at liberty to command me at any time."

He replied: "I order you at once. I am anxious to see the home of
Henry Clay and the monument erected to his memory."

Next morning we went to Ashland and then to the cemetery. After
visiting the Clay monument, we were passing near where my daughter had
been buried only a few months before. When I had called his attention
to the sacred spot, Mr. Cook said: "I read Miss Willard's account of
her death, and the beautiful tribute paid her in the Union Signal.
Please stop a moment."

He left the carriage and going to the grave, took off his hat and
stood with uncovered head for a few moments. Then taking his seat
beside me in the carriage, he laid his hand on mine and said: "Blessed
are the dead that die in the Lord."

With tears rolling down my cheeks I said to myself: "Under the great
brain of Joseph Cook beats a tender heart." Not to know him was to
misjudge him, while the close touch of friendship revealed one of
God's noblemen.

Unity in variety is the order of nature. Out of what seems to us a
medley of contradictions come amendments and reconstructions that
illustrate the benevolent guardianship of God in working out the
problem of creation. But affairs are now changed. During the progress
of military operations, there have arisen in the parliamentary armies
many excellent officers, who are qualified for higher commands than
they are now possessed of.

And though it becomes not men engaged in such a cause "to put trust
in the arm of flesh," yet he could assure them, that their troops
contained generals fit to command in any enterprise in Christendom.
The army, indeed, he was sorry to say it, did not correspond by its
discipline to the merit of the officers; nor were there any hopes, till
the present vices and disorders which prevail among the soldiers were
repressed by a new model that their forces would ever be attended with
signal success in any undertaking.

In opposition to this reasoning of the Independents, many of the
Presbyterians showed the inconvenience and danger of the projected
alteration. Whitlocke, in particular, a man of honor, who loved his
country, though in every change of government he always adhered to the
ruling power, said, that besides the ingratitude of discarding, and
that by fraud and artifice, so many noble persons, to whom the parliament
had hitherto owed its chief support, they would find it extremely
difficult to supply the place of men now formed by experience to command
and authority: that the rank alone possessed by such as were members
of either house, prevented envy, retained the army in obedience, and
gave weight to military orders: that greater confidence might safely
be reposed in men of family and fortune, than in mere adventurers,
who would be apt to entertain separate views from those which were
embraced by the persons who employed them: that no maxim of policy
was more undisputed, than the necessity of preserving an inseparable
connection between the civil and military powers, and of retaining
the latter in strict subordination to the former: that the Greeks
and Romans, the wisest and most passionate lovers of liberty, had
ever intrusted to their senators the command of armies, and had
maintained an unconquerable jealousy of all mercenary forces: and
that such men alone, whose interests were involved in those of the
public, and who possessed a vote in the civil deliberations, would
sufficiently respect the authority of parliament, and never could
be tempted to turn the sword against those by whom it was committed
to them.[*] 
* Whitlocke, p. 114, 115.

Rush. vol. vii. p. 6.

Notwithstanding these reasonings, a committee was chosen to frame
what was called the "self-denying ordinance," by which the members of
both houses were excluded from all civil and military employments,
except a few offices which were specified. This ordinance was the
subject of great debate, and for a long time rent the parliament and
city into factions. But at last, by the prevalence of envy with some;
with others, of false modesty; with a great many, of the republican
and Independent views; it passed the house of commons, and was
sent to the upper house.

The peers, though the scheme was in part levelled against their order;
though all of them were at bottom extremely averse to it; though
they even ventured once to reject it; yet possessed so little
authority, that they durst not persevere in opposing the resolution
of the commons; and they thought it better policy, by an unlimited
compliance, to ward off that ruin which they saw approaching.[*]
The ordinance, therefore, having passed both houses, Essex, Warwick,
Manchester, Denbigh, Waller, Brereton, and many others, resigned
their commands, and received the thanks of parliament for their
good services.

A pension of ten thousand pounds a year was settled on Essex

.

{1645.} It was agreed to recruit the army to twenty-two thousand
men; and Sir Thomas Fairfax was appointed general.[**] It is remarkable
that his commission did not run, like that of Essex, in the name
of the king and parliament, but in that of the parliament alone;
and the article concerning the safety of the king's person was
omitted: so much had animosities increased between the parties.[***]
Cromwell, being a member of the lower house, should have been
discarded with the others; but this impartiality would have
disappointed all the views of those who had introduced the self-denying
ordinance.

He was saved by a subtlety, and by that political craft in which
he was so eminent. At the time when the other officers resigned their
commissions, care was taken that he should be sent with a body of horse
to relieve Taunton besieged by the royalists. His absence being remarked
orders were despatched for his immediate attendance in parliament; and
the new general was directed to employ some other officer in that
service.
My young friends, I will admit love is a kind of spontaneous,
impulsive, natural affinity, something after the order of molecular
attraction or chemical affinity, but while by the natural law of love,
a young woman may see in the object of her affection her ideal of
perfection in humanity, she owes volitional conformity to a higher law
than natural affinity. She owes to herself, to posterity and to her
country a careful study of the character of the young man to whom she
should link her life and love.

I believe two dark clouds hanging upon the horizon of this republic to
be the recklessness with which life is linked with life at the
marriage altar, and the recklessness with which we elect men to
offices of public trust. While we have many public men, schooled in
the science of government, whom the spoils of office cannot corrupt,
we have an army of demagogues who rely upon saloon politics for
promotion, and on all moral questions reason with their stomachs
instead of their brains. This is especially true in the government of
our large cities.

Sam Jones, lecturing in a city noted for its corrupt government said:
"Take the political gang you have running this city, put them in a
cage, then let the devil pass along and look in and he would say,
'That beats anything I have in my show.'"

We don't seem to realize that every public man is a teacher, every
home is a school, and the education received outside the schoolroom is
often more effective than the education inside. All the forces and
elements of the organism of society are teachers and all life is
learning. The birth of an infant into this world is its matriculation
into a university, where it graduates in successive degrees. And do
you know in this great school of human life, where I come with you to
study the traits of our kind, that we never reach a grade that we are
not influenced by what touches us? Here I am past fifty years of age
(and then "some"), yet I am constantly being influenced by what
touches me.

Start a new song with a popular air and it will spread throughout the
whole country. Boys will whistle it and girls will sing it. A number
of years ago, when at the station ready to leave home for New England,
a lad near me began to whistle and then to sing a new song. It was a
catchy tune and took hold of me. On the train I found myself trying to
hum that tune, then I tried to whistle it, and failing in both
attempts I finally gave it up. Two days after I left the train up in a
New Hampshire town and took a street car for the hotel. A blizzard was
on, but there stood the motorman, muffled to his ears, whistling the
same tune I had heard down in Kentucky, "There'll be a hot time in the
old town tonight."

When the telephone made its appearance a good Christian man had one
installed in his store and during the morning hours of the first day
he called up all his friends who had phones, and "Hello! Hello!" took
hold of him. He went home to lunch and being a little late he hurried
into his chair at the table. With the telephone still on his mind, he
bowed his head to return thanks and said: "Hello." He was a good
Christian man, but the telephone had taken hold of him.

The very tone of the voice has a tendency to influence and control
character. I wonder so many parents train their voices as they do.
They have a kind of snap to the tone which they evidently think makes
the children and the servants "get a move" on them. Perhaps it does,
but at the same time it falls upon a family like frost upon a field of
flowers. You pay three dollars to have your piano tuned, yet you train
your voice to sound harsh and hard.

How the tone of the voice controls was illustrated in my own home
several years ago. I went home in the early spring and found some one
had been among my bees and had left the lids of the hives lifted at
the time the bees were making brood. Going to the house I said to my
wife:

"Where is Charlie?" He was the colored man in charge of the barn and
garden.

Mrs. Bain replied: "I suppose he is about the barn; he doesn't stay in
the house." I knew that, but somehow we Adams will go to our Eves with
anything that goes wrong.

"What's the trouble?" my wife asked.

I told her about the exposure of the bees, (about the effect of which
I knew very little) and said:

"I want Charlie to keep out of that apiary. He'll kill every bee I
have."

Mrs. Bain in a very gentle manner said: "I did that myself. That's the
way father used to do. I was afraid your bees might starve during the
long cold spell, so I made some syrup and placed it in the upper
compartments. I lifted the lids so that the light would attract the
bees up to the syrup. I'm very sorry I did it, but I thought it would
please you."

I said: "Well, I believe you did the right thing, my dear, and I am
very much obliged to you."

If my wife had said in a harsh tone: "I did that, sir. What are you
going to do about it?" then I would have said something.

A little bit of anger let loose in a field of human nature is as
destructible to noble impulses and generous feelings as a cyclone is
to a town. I was in an Iowa cyclone some years ago and I noticed when
it was approaching the people didn't run out of their homes and throw
stones at it. They ran for the storm cellars. When you see a bit of
anger coming toward you from brother, sister, husband, wife or friend,
don't throw a dictionary of aggravating words at it; get out of the
way and it will quiet down like the troubled waters of Galilee when
"Peace be still" fell upon them.

When we realize how sensitive character is to the touch of influences,
and how uncertain the character of the influence that may touch us,
how very careful we should be as parents as to what shall touch us,
how we shall touch others, who may be fed by our fulness, starved by
our emptiness, uplifted by our righteousness or tainted by our sins.

Sometimes a boy is sent to school with the idea that the influence of
the teacher will mold the character of the boy, when the magnetic
touch by which the faculties of the boy are sprung doesn't come from
the teacher, but from some boy on the playground and perhaps not the
best boy. Some boys are as potent on the playground as a major-general
on a battle-field. Some persons are like loadstones, they draw, others
are like loads of stone, they have to be drawn.

I have known down South in the days of slavery, coal black queens of
the domestic circle. The cows would come to the cupping as if it were
a spiritual devotion. Maiden mistresses would tell them their love
stories, when they wouldn't tell their own mothers. I am a southern
man, born and reared mid slavery, and I pay this tribute to the black
"mammies" of the South before the war. Down there in that hale, hearty
colored motherhood was laid the foundation of future health and
strength for many a white baby, when otherwise its mother would have
had to see it die. Frail, delicate mothers, who because of slavery had
not done sufficient work to develop physical womanhood, were not able
to nurse their own infants and gave them to the care of vigorous,
healthy colored mothers, who took them to their bosoms and nursed them
into strength. But for that supplemental supply of vigor, but for that
sympathetic partnership in motherhood, much of the most potent manhood
of the South would never have been known.

You who lived in the North before the war, and you who are younger and
have read about the auction block, the slave driver and the
cottonfield cannot understand the attachment between one of these
colored mothers and the white boy or girl she nursed. I know whereof I
speak, for I revere the memory of my old black mammy.

There are verses, written by whom I do not know, the words of which I
cannot recall except a line here and there, hence I take the liberty
to supply the missing lines and revise the verses to express my
feelings for the slave mammy of my childhood.


  "She was only a dear old darkey,
    In a cabin far away,
  Down in the sunny Southland,
    Where sunbeams dance and play.
  Yet oft in dreams I hear her crooning,
    Crooning soft and low:
  'Sleep on, baby boy,
    The sleep will make you grow.'

  "Oft when tired of fighting
    In a world so full of wrong;
  When wearied and worried
    With the tumult and the throng,
  I seek again the cabin,
    Where dwelt a heart of gold
  And in dreams she loves and pets me,
    As she did in days of old.

  "Oh, my dear old colored mammy,
    In the cabin far away,
  Since you rocked me in the cradle
    Seems forever and a day.
  Yet in dreams I hear you crooning
    Above my cradle nest;
  'Sleep on, baby boy,
    Mammy watches while you rest.'"

A white baby, whose mother was ill for months, was given to one of
these colored mothers to nurse. After the war the white family moved
west. As their child grew up the father and mother often told her
about Aunt Hannah, how she loved her, petted her, cooked for her, and
drove away her own pickaninnies to let "mammy's baby" sleep.

The girl, when she had grown to womanhood, heard that Aunt Hannah was
still living and she longed to see her devoted old colored mammy. Her
parents had the same desire, and with other attachments for the old
southern home, they went back to Georgia on a visit and to the village
where the old woman lived. She was sent for and the old black mammy
and the beautiful young girl faced each other. The young lady was
disappointed. She expected to see a nice, comely old woman, but there
she stod, crippled with rheumatism, gray headed, wrinkled, and poorly
clad. The old woman was surprised, for there before her stood a
beautiful young woman, with rosy cheeks, blue eyes, auburn locks and
queenly form. The father and mother stood near, with tears rolling
down their cheeks as memory came surging up like successive waves from
out a past hallowed to them, for they could see in that old woman the
health and strength of their child.

The old woman broke the silence, saying: "Is dat my chile? Is dat de
chile I loved and laid wake wif so many nights and cooked so many
sweet things for? Why, bless yo' heart, honey; dese old hands ust to
take yo' and hug yo' to dis bosom, but yo's too nice now for dese old
hands to eber touch agin."

The young girl said: "No, I'm not, Aunt Hannah. You shall take me in
your arms as when I was a little child," and she gave a bound into the
old woman's arms.

That does not mean social equality, but it does mean gratitude neither
condition nor color can ever bound. If the reciprocities of that old
woman and that beautiful girl were such as to weave enrichments into
both hearts, why should not all peoples, and all individuals, see in
all others but a multiplication of the one each of us is, and that
each is enhanced or diminished in value according to the concentrated
worth of the whole? If man would stand in his lot of conformity to
man, as that old colored woman stood in her lot, it would lift this
world to that height from which we could see the one interest, one
reciprocal, interdependent, together-woven, God-allied and God-saved
humanity.

But in this we fail. Several men, one of them an Irishman, were
standing on a street corner when a negro passed. The Irishman said:
"Faith, and if I had been makin' humanity for a world, I would niver
have made a nager." I suppose in return the negro would not have made
the Irishman, nor would the white man have made the Indian or
Chinaman, but God made them all and in proportion as we have the
philanthropic comprehensiveness to accept them all, and benevolently
try to serve them in their places, do we honor the place assigned us
in the world's creation. It is not for us to know why God made this or
that; He made everything for a purpose.

A father took his boy to an animal show. The lad had never seen a
monkey and as they played their pranks about the cage he said:
"Father, did God make monkeys?"

When the father replied: "Yes," the boy said: "Well, don't you guess
God laughed when he made the first monkey?"

I don't know about that, but if God made the monkey for a joke it was
certainly a success. If God had made the monkey for no other purpose
than to create laughter it wouldn't have been a mistake. The lachrymal
glands were placed in us for sorrow to play upon; we are commanded to
"weep with those who weep." In antithesis to this the risable nerves
were placed in us for mirthful music, and I pity the one who has
broken the keys and cannot laugh.

I believe we owe the Irishman a vote of thanks for the ringing laughs
he has sent around the world. An Irishman said to a rich English
land-owner:

"Me Lord, I think the world is very unaqually divided; it should be
portioned out and each one given an aqual share with ivery other one?"

The Englishman replied: "Well, Pat, if we were to divide today, in ten
years I would have ten thousand pounds and you wouldn't have a
shilling."

"Then we would divide again," said the Irishman.

On an electric car going out of New York City, a man, who occupied a
seat next to the aisle, had a pet monkey in a cage on the seat with
him, next to the window. An Irishman boarded the car and seeing all
the seats taken he remained standing, holding on to a strap, when
suddenly he spied the monkey in the cage. He immediately addressed the
man who had the monkey:

"Sir, is that gintleman in the cage paying his fare? If not, I'd like
to have the sate."

The owner of the monkey lifted the cage to his lap and moved over,
giving the Irishman a seat.

"What's the nationality of that gintleman, anyway?" asked Pat.

By this time the other man was very much out of humor and said: "He's
half ape and half Irish."

"Faith, then he's related to both of us," replied the witty son of
Erin, and there were two monkeys on that car.

I'll admit this trait of humor comes in sometimes when it is quite
embarrassing, as it was to Sam Jones upon one occasion, when in the
midst of a sermon before a large audience, he said:

"All you who want to go to heaven, stand up; I'd like to take a look
at you."

The audience arose in great numbers. When seated again Mr. Jones said:
"Now all you who want to go to the devil, stand and let's have a look
at you."

All was silent for a moment and then a tall, lank, lean fellow from
the backwoods arose and said: "Well, parson, I don't care anything
special about seeing the old chap, but I never desert a friend in
trouble, specially a minister, so I guess I'll have to stand with
you."

Dr. Frank Gunsaulus told me of a time when he had to laugh under
embarrassing circumstances. He was called upon to preach the funeral
of a man who had died from the effects of drink. His friends had made
a box for the corpse and had placed in the top a ten by twelve window
glass to go over the face, but when the time came to put the top on
the box, being double-sighted from drink, they reversed the top and
had the glass at the foot of the coffin instead of the head.

The preacher took his place, as he supposed, at the head of the
deceased, when looking down his eyes fell upon a pair of feet. With
great effort he kept his face straight and conducted the service. At
the close he invited the friends to view the remains. One stimulated
friend walked up to the coffin, shook his head and turning to another
said: "Don't look at him, Jim. He's changing very fast and you won't
know him."

The great preacher is to be excused if he did laught at that funeral.

It's good to laugh, and yet, while I pay tribute to the trait of
humor, I would have the undergirding trait of all traits of character,
the trait of principle. Though you may use policy now and then, never
use a policy you must get off the heaven-bound express train of
principle to use.

I don't like that word policy. There is another and better name for
the trait I would present just here, and that is _tact_. It means the
doing of a right thing at the right time and in the right place. Some
young men win first honors in college and fail in the business of life
for want of tact. Here is where the Yankee excels. The Southerner is
genial, generous and has many traits of character to be admired, but
he must doff his hat to Yankee character for the development of tact.

Sam Jones, who rarely ever failed to get the best of whoever tried
repartee with him, met more than his match when he ran up against
Yankee tact. He was raising money to pay off the debt on a church.

A liberal member said: "Mr. Jones, I have given about all I can afford
to give, but if you will get one dollar from that old man on the end
of the back bench of the 'amen corner,' I'll give you ten dollars
more."

"Has he any money, and is he a member of the church?"

"Yes," was the answer to both questions.

The great evangelist said: "Well, that's easy," and started for the
dollar.

Approaching the old man he said: "Brother, I'm collecting money for
the Lord. You owe him a dollar. I'm told you are an honest man and
always pay your debts, so hand over that dollar."

"How old are you, sir?" asked the old man.

When Sam gave his age at about forty, the old brother said: "I'm
nearly double your age, sir, and will very likely see the Lord before
you do, so I'll just give him the dollar myself."

I lectured in New England a few years ago when before me sat a Yankee
with his two sons. He sat between them and when I made a point which
he approved, he would nudge the boys. He seemed to be driving my
advice in with his elbows. At the close of the lecture I took his hand
and said: "I see you have your boys with you."

He replied: "Yes, I always take the two boys with me when I attend a
lecture. I presume when a speaker has prepared himself he is going to
get about the best things out of his subject, and will put them in a
way to take hold and benefit young men. If I were going to get the
same information out of books I might have to spend a dollar or two,
when I only paid fifteen cents each for them to hear your lecture."

This trait of tact, however, is moving south, and even the colored
race is getting hold of it. An old negro who was born on the
plantation where he lived when set free, remained after the war in his
cabin and worked for the son of his old master. In his old age his
memory began to fail and he would neglect to do things he was told to
do. The young man was patient with the old negro for quite a while but
finally said to him:

"Uncle Dan, you must do better or you and I will have to separate."

The old servant said: "Mars Jim, I does the best I can. I is mighty
sorry I forgits things and I'se gwine to try to do better."

But he grew worse and one evening when he failed to do a very
important chore, the young man said: "I told you what would happen if
you did not do better and the time has come when you and I separate."

Uncle Dan replied: "I'se mighty sorry, Marse Jim. I was here when you
was born, and when you growed big enuf I ust to take you on de mule
out to de field wif me, and I members how you ust to take de lines and
dribe de ole mule. Den when de war broke out and ole Master jined de
army, I stayed here and took care ob ole Missus and you chilluns. I
shore is mighty sorry we's got to part, but if you says so den its got
to be, but look here, Mars Jim, if we's got to part, whar's you
counting on moving to?"

By this time tact had done its work, aggravation had melted into
forgiveness and the young man said: "I'm not going to move anywhere,
Uncle Dan, nor shall you. We'll both stay here on the old plantation
together." That was certainly tact on the old man's part.

A young negro, who craved a ride on a railroad train but had no money,
crept under the baggage car and fixed himself on the truck. The train
started and when at full speed the engine struck a mule and tore the
animal to pieces. Part of the mangled remains was carried into the
running gear of the baggage car. The engineer stopped the train and
commenced pulling out pieces of mule here and there until he reached
the baggage car, when, looking under for more of the mule, he saw the
white eyes of the negro.

"Come out, you imp, what are you doing under there?" said the
engineer.

Back came the tactful reply: "Boss, I wus de fellow what wus ridin'
dat mule."

The engineer said: "Well, I guess you've paid your fare; climb into
the cab and help me run this train."

I commend to you the cultivation of tact, but don't let it lead you
into the meanest trait of character--selfishness. To say,

  "Of all my father's family I love myself the best,
  If Providence takes care of me, who cares what takes the rest?"

In the days when there was a community hearse in a country
neighborhood, and carpenters made the coffins, a young man, who was
ashamed of the old worn-out hearse, went about soliciting money to
purchase a new one. Presenting the purpose to an old man of means, he
received from this selfish citizen the reply:

"I won't give you a dollar. I helped to buy the old hearse twenty
years ago, and neither me nor my family have ever had any benefit from
it."

Against this trait of selfishness I place the most beautiful of all
traits--sympathy. I would rather have the record of Clara Barton in
the great reckoning day than that of any statesman whose portrait
hangs in a hall of fame.

During our Civil War she went from battlefield to battlefield, and was
just as kind to the boy in gray as she was to the boy in blue.

After the Civil War Queen Victoria desired to communicate with Clara
Barton regarding the same mission of mercy for the German army, where
the Queen's daughter was then engaged. But Clara Barton was already on
the ocean, and soon after was in the war zone with the German army.
She was with the first who climbed the defenses of Strassburg, where
she ministered to the wounded and dying. At the close of her work
there she took ten thousand garments with her to France. There she
waited till the Commune fell and again she was with the first to reach
the suffering. In our own war with Spain she went to Cuba, and though
then past sixty years of age, she stood among the cots of our wounded
and sick soldiers, soothing their sufferings and cheering their
hearts.

Still later on in storm-swept Galveston, Texas, she fell at her post
of duty and was borne back by loving hands to her home, where she
recovered and again resumed her work of love and mercy, to carry it on
to the end of her long and useful life.

No wonder the King and court of Germany bestowed upon her medals of
remembrance; no wonder the Grand Duchess of Baden placed upon her the
"Red Cross of Geneva;" and in the great day of reward, He who bore the
cross for us all will place upon Clara Barton the crown of eternal
life.

When my wife was president of the House of Mercy, in Lexington,
Kentucky, a home for the rescue of fallen girls, she went in her
carriage to a dentist with one of the unfortunate inmates.

Soon after a business man of the city said to me: "I hardly see how
you can give your consent to have your wife do such work. I saw her
recently in her carriage with a girl I would not have my wife seen
with for any amount of money."

My reply was: "I would rather my wife should go through the golden
gates, bearing in her arms the spirit of a poor girl, snatched from
the hell of a harlot's home, than to be the leader of the fashionable
four hundred of New York City."

There is a beautiful story told of one of the most influential and
wealthy men of England. He inherited fame as well as fortune, had an
Oxford education and early in life he was elected a member of
Parliament. One evening he sat in his fine library, watching the wood
fire build its temples of flame around the great andirons, and as he
heard the beating of the wild winter storm against the window pane,
his heart went out to the homeless hungry poor of the city. Ordering
his carriage he went to the city mission and asked for a helper, and
then drove to London Bridge, under the shelter of which the penniless
poor gather in time of storms. He took them two by two to shelter,
gave them food, and cots on which to sleep, and then returned to his
princely home. We are told that for years after, when Parliament would
adjourn at midnight, this young man would go through the slums on his
way home, that he might relieve some poor child of misfortune.

On Sunday afternoons, while aristocracy lined the boulevards, this son
of fortune would take his physician in his carriage and go through the
slums, seeking the sick and suffering. One afternoon, while he stood
outside a tenement door, awaiting the return of the doctor from a
visit to a poor sick soul inside the tenement, he became deeply moved
by the ragged children playing in the gutters and reaching into
garbage barrels for crusts of bread. He said: "Ah! here's the riddle
of civilization. I wish I could help to solve it; perhaps I can."

He began the establishment of "ragged schools" and into these ware
gathered thousands of poor children. Then followed night schools for
boys who had to work by day. To these schools he added homes for
working women, and for these women he persuaded Parliament to give
shorter hours of service. He tore down old rookeries, built neat
dwellings instead, beneath the windows planted little flower gardens,
and rented them to the poor at the same price they had paid for the
rookeries.

When he began to fade, as the leaf fades in its autumn beauty, and the
day of his departure was at hand, he said: "I am sorry to leave the
world with so much misery in it, but I have lived to prove that every
kind word spoken, and every good deed done, sooner or later returns to
bless the giver."

As the end drew near he said to his daughter: "Read me the
twenty-third Psalm, for 'though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I fear no evil.'"

A few days later Westminster Abbey was crowded with England's nobility
to do him honor. When the funeral procession reached Trafalgar Square,
thousands of working women stood, with uncovered heads and tearful
eyes, to pay their tribute. Children came from the "ragged schools"
bearing banners with the motto: "I was naked and ye clothed me." From
the hospitals came the motto: "I was sick and ye visited me," while
the working girls came with a silk flag on which they had embroidered
with their own fingers: "Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of
these, ye did it unto me."

Thus loaded down with the fruits of the Spirit, Lord Shaftsbury died,
and yet lives in memory as the noblest embodiment of Christian
charity.

That's sweet music when nature hangs her wind-harps in the trees for
autumn breezes to play thereon; that must have been sweet music when
Jenny Lind so charmed the world with her voice, and when Ole Bull
rosined the bow and touched the strings of his violin; that was sweet
music when I sat in the twilight on the stoop of my childhood's home
and heard the welkin ring with the songs of the old plantation; but
the sweetest music in this old world is that which thrills the soul
when spoken in "words of love and deeds of kindness." Cultivate the
trait of sympathy. The good things you are going to say of your friend
when he's dead, say them to him while he's alive. Take care of the
living; God will care for the dead.

To the trait of sympathy I would add two grand traits--decision and
courage.

  "Tender handed touch a nettle.
    And it stings you for your pains;
  Grasp it like a man of mettle,
    Silk it in your hand remains."

The decision to throw over the tea in Boston harbor, to write "Charles
Carroll of Carrolton," and the courage to say, "Give me liberty or
give me death," gave us this government by and for the people.

  "If you come to a river deep and wide,
    And you've no canoe to skim it;
  If your duty's on the other side,
    Jump in, my boy, and swim it."

Have the courage to stand for what you believe to be right. You may
have to go ahead of public sentiment at times, but you will be
rewarded in having your conviction and conscience with you.

A number of years ago in Boston, I gave a temperance address on Sunday
afternoon in Music Hall. At the close of the lecture a friend said to
me: "You said some good things but though from the old bourbon State
of Kentucky, you are ahead of public sentiment in Boston."

I replied: "Public sentiment does not always indicate what is right
even in Boston. On your beautiful Commonwealth Avenue yesterday
afternoon I met an elegantly dressed lady, I suppose a wealthy one
from her jewels and dress. She had a poodle dog in her arms, with a
blue ribbon on its neck. Yet, the same woman wouldn't be caught
carrying her six-weeks' old baby down the street for any
consideration."

Such is public sentiment in fashionable society in our cities, and yet
the highest type of the world's creation is a pure, sweet mother with
a babe in her arms, and another holding her apron strings. I think it
would be a blessing to home life if an avenging angel should go
through this country, smiting every English pug and poodle dog bought
to take the place of babies. In their places I would put bright-eyed,
rosy cheeked children to greet fathers when they return home from
their day's labor.

Battle for the right, remembering that far better is a fiery furnace
with an angel for company, than worshiping a brazen image on the
plains of Dura.

Some young man may now be saying in his mind, "For me to always stand
for the right would be to meet difficulties at every step of the way."
Don't get alarmed over difficulties. Half of them are imaginary.

I made my first trip to California thirty-five years ago. One morning
I stood on the eastern edge of the plains with a sleeping car berth at
my service and a through ticket to San Francisco in my pocket, while
the iron horse stood there all harnessed and ready for the journey.
Wasn't I in good condition for the trip? Yes, but I saw trouble before
me. One can always see trouble who looks for it. I had never been
across the plains and before the time for the train to start I walked
to the front of the engine and looking along the track as it reached
out across the prairie I saw trouble. What was it? Why, six miles
ahead the track wasn't wide enough. Yes, I saw it. Then on six miles
more the rails came together, with my destination nineteen hundred
miles away. Soon the train moved and as we neared the difficulty, the
track opened to welcome us. Not a pin was torn up nor a rail
displaced. Again I looked ahead and a mountain was on the track, but
before I had time to get off the mountain got off. Next came a
precipice and the engine making directly for it, but we dodged that
and I concluded our train had right of way, so I stuck to the Pullman
car and went through all right.

Ever since God made the world principle has had right of way. Get you
a through ticket, get on the train, battle for the right and you'll
come out victorious in the end.

Napoleon said: "God is on the side of the strongest battalions." He
entered Moscow with one hundred and twenty thousand men. Snow began to
fall several weeks earlier than usual, the highways were blocked,
frost fiends ruled the air, the great French army was broken into
pieces and Napoleon had to fly for his life. God taught Napoleon as
well as the commander of the great Spanish Armada, that victory is in
the hands of Him who rules weather and waves.

The next trait I would mention is contentment. Many persons make
themselves miserable by contrasting the little they have with the much
that others have, when if they would compare their blessings with the
miseries of others it would add to their contentment. Let me give you
an old but a good motto: "Never anything so bad, but it might have
been worse!"

It is told of a happy hearted old man that no matter what would happen
he would say: "It might have been worse." A friend, who wanted to see
if the old man would say the same under all circumstances, went into a
grocery store where he was seated by a big fire and said:

"Uncle Jim, last night I dreamt I died and was sent to perdition."

Prompt the reply came: "Well, it might have been worse."

When some one asked, "How could it have been worse," he answered: "It
might have been true."

Doctor A.A. Willetts, "the Apostle of Sunshine," used to say: "There
are two things I never worry over; one is the thing I can help, the
other is the thing I can't help." "Count your blessings," was a
favorite expression of the same beloved old man.

There are more bright days than cloudy ones, a thousand song birds for
every rain-crow, a whole acre of green grass for every grave, more
persons outside the penitentiary than inside, more good men than bad,
more good women than good men; slavery, dueling, lottery and polygamy
are outlawed, the saloon is on the run, the wide world will soon be so
sick of war that universal peace, with "good will among men," will
prevail, labor and capital will be peaceful partners and human
brotherhood will rule in righteousness throughout the world.

  "O, this is not so bad a world,
    As some would like to make it,
  And whether it is good or bad,
    Depends on how we take it."

Fanny Crosby, whose gospel hymns are continually singing souls into
the kingdom, when but six weeks old lost her sight and for ninety-two
years made her way in literal darkness, without seeing the beauties of
nature about her, the blue sky with its sun, moon and stars above her,
the faces of her loved ones, and yet at ninety-two she said: "I never
worry, never think disagreeable things, never find fault with anything
or anybody. If in all the world there is a happier being than myself,
I would like to shake that one's hand." No wonder out of such
contentment came such songs as, "Jesus is calling," "I am Thine, O
Lord," "Safe in the arms of Jesus."

How different the cultured young woman, with all her senses preserved,
who after passing through a flower garden where perfect sight had
feasted on the beauty of the scene said:

  "To think of summers yet to come,
    That I am not to see;
  To think a weed is yet to bloom,
    From dust that I shall be."

Poor soul! Instead of enjoying the summer she had, she was coveting
all the summers between her and eternity. Instead of thanking God for
the immortality of the soul when done with the body, she was
disappointed because she couldn't carry the old body along with her.
Don't let these things trouble you. Live one summer so you will be
worthy to breathe the air of the next if you live to see it; take care
of your body so it will make a decent weed if God chooses to make one
out of your remains.

Enjoy what you have, don't covet what you have not, thank God for your
home on earth, follow Fanny Crosby's receipt for contentment and you
will be happy enough to shake hands with her in the "Land of the
Leal."

Before I close would you like to have me point you to greatness? In
attempting to do so, I would not point you to Congress hall or Senate
chamber. You can find greatness anywhere.

That was greatness when John Bartholamew held the throttle of an
engine going over the Sierra mountains, with a train load of
passengers depending upon his skill and caution, and swinging round a
curve he saw the wood-work of a tunnel before him on fire. To attempt
to stop the train then, would be to halt in the flames. He threw on
more steam and sent the train whizzing through the furnace of fire.
Passing out on the other end he was badly burned, but still held the
rein of his iron horse. A poem dedicated to this brave engineer closes
with the verse:

  "I 'spose I might have jumped the train,
    In thought of saving sinew and bone,
  And left them women and children
    To take the ride alone.

  "But I thought on a day of recknin',
    And whatever old John done here,
  The Lord ain't going to say to him there,
    'You went back as an engineer.'"

History of life on the ocean tells us of a ship doomed to go down with
four hundred human beings on board. The pumps were not equal to the
task of holding the water down to the safety line. The captain said:
"We will draw lots for the life-boats, one hundred and twenty will go
in them and the remainder must go down with the ship."

One after another drew his lot. A sailor, who had drawn the lot of
death, walked to the railing and said to a comrade in a life-boat:
"When you reach the shore, see my wife, tell her good-bye for me and
help her in getting my back pay, for she will need it," and he stepped
back and took his place with the doomed.

Finally the old mate thrust in his brawny hand and drew a lot for the
life-boats. He stepped aside to watch those to follow in the drawing,
when a very popular officer of the ship drew his lot. He was doomed to
go down with the ship. Though a brave man, the thought of his loved
ones at home overcame him, and dropping upon his knees he said: "O
God, have mercy upon my wife and little children."

The old mate went up to him and taking his hand said: "We have been in
many storms together and have been good friends for years. You have a
wife and three sweet little children, while I have no one that will
rejoice at my coming, nor will any one weep if I never return. It
might have been my fate to go down instead of you, and it shall be.
You take my lot, and I'll take yours."

The offer was refused, but the mate forced his friend into a boat
saying, "Good-bye, I'll die for you like a man."

The greatness of this world doesn't all belong to your Solons,
Solomons, Washingtons, Napoleons, Grants, Lees or Gladstones, but
yonder in the humbler walks of life are heroes and heroines, who in
the final reckoning day, will pale the lustre of some whose names are
engraved on marble monuments and whose praises are perpetuated in
poetry and song.

If you ask me to point you to greatness I do not direct your minds to
historic heights, but that you may win your share of greatness I close
this address by saying, wherever your lot in life be cast,

  "In the name of God advancing,
    Plow, sow and labor now;
  Let there be when evening cometh,
    Honest sweat upon thy brow.

  Then will come the Master,
    When work stops at set of sun,
  Saying, as He pays the wages,
    'Good and faithful one, well done.'"


II

A SEARCHLIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.


But a little more than a century ago, the old world laughed at the
new. Writers of the old world called our American eagle, "a paper
bird, brooding over a barren waste;" yet in what they then called a
barren waste, railroads now carry more of the products of the earth,
than all the railroads of all the lands, of all the peoples on the
face of the earth.

When New England people believed there would never be anything worth
having west of the Connecticut River, what if some seer had prophesied
that in nineteen hundred there would be a city on Manhattan Island
named New York that would rival London, two southwest, Baltimore and
Washington to equal Venice, Philadelphia to match Liverpool, Pittsburg
and Buffalo to surpass Birmingham, and beyond these a city called
Chicago, which in grit and growth would beat anything the old world
ever dreamt of; while on still farther west, would be a State named
Iowa, in which in nineteen hundred and fourteen, would be produced
enough cattle to beef England, enough potatoes to feed Ireland and
hogs to "beat the Jews."

What if he had continued; that in the libraries of the barren waste,
there would be ten million more books, than in the combined libraries
of Europe; that its college students would outnumber the college
students of England, France and Germany combined; that its wealth
would be great enough to purchase the empires of Russia and Turkey,
the kingdoms of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland, with South
Africa and all her diamond mines thrown in, and then have enough left
to buy a dozen archipelagoes at twenty millions each, and still have
the wealth of the republic growing at the rate of five millions of
dollars every twenty-four hours. What a land in which to live! Think
of it; less than a century and a half ago, Liberty and England's
runaway daughter, Columbia, took each other "for better or for worse,
forever and for aye" and started down time's rugged stream of years.
George Washington, then Chief Magistrate, performed the ceremony, and
what he joined together time has not put asunder. It was not a wedding
in high life, such as shakes the foundation of fashionable society
today, but rather more like the swearing away of a verdant country
couple, in some Gretna Green, with no other capital than youth, health
and trusting confidence. We have had some domestic discords; once a
very serious family row, but I of the South, join you of the North, in
thanks to God, the application for divorce was not granted, and we are
still a united republic.

The memories which followed that civil strife were so bitter,
doubtless many of you northern brethren believed the men who
surrendered at Appomattox were not any too sincere, and if we should
ever have war with any foreign country, the north, east and west would
have to furnish the patriotism, for the South would never again march
under the stars and stripes. But when the Spanish-American war broke
out, the first boy to pour out his heart's blood for his country's
flag, was Ensign Bagley, of North Carolina. The young man who
penetrated the Island of Cuba, 'mid Spanish bayonets and bullets, and
searched out Cevera and his fleet in the harbor was Victor Blue, the
son of a Confederate soldier. The young man who sank the Merrimac,
Captain Richmond Pearson Hobson, was the son of another Confederate.
Our Consul in Cuba, whose patriotism no one ever doubted, was General
Fitzhugh Lee, and the old man who planted the flag in the tree-tops
around Santiago, and led two negro regiments into the battle, was
fighting Joe Wheeler of the Confederate army.

If I were to close here, what an optimistic picture would be left in
the glow of the century's searchlight. But alas! we have unsolved
problems of imperial moment, and my purpose is to throw the
searchlight upon a few of these unsolved problems.

First, being a southern man, I shall turn it upon the Race Problem.

A century ago the Indian question was a perplexing problem, but it
cuts but little figure now, for the Indian is nightly pitching his
moving tepee a day's march nearer the sunset shore, where one more
shove, and,

  "Mad to life's history
  Glad to death's mystery,"

the red race will go, to where the pale face will cease from
troubling, and the weary spirit will find its rest at last.

The Chinese question is of equal insignificance, since our doors are
closed and barred against the almond eyes of the Orient.

The Negro question seems to be the race riddle of our civilization and
it will take much tact, patience and wisdom to solve the problem. It
may be a revelation to some of you to know, that at the rate the negro
race has grown since the Civil War, when the twentieth century goes
out, there will be sixty millions of negroes in one black belt across
the Southland. I say across the Southland because, the main body of
the negro race will never leave the track of the southern sun. The
South held the negro in slavery, the North set him free. We supposed
at the close of the war, he would leave the South and go to live among
his liberators. But after half a century, he is still clinging to the
cotton and the cane, or sitting in his log house home, the "shadowed
livery of the burning sun" upon his brow, the plantation song still
lingering on his lips, the banjo tuned to memory's melodies on his
knee, a clump of kinky-headed pickaninnies playing in the sand about
his cabin door, and there he sits multiplying the Southland and
problemizing the century.

I have not time to discuss at length the solution of the problems
before us, but I hope to present them in such a manner as will help
you to appreciate their importance and how they are linked with the
destiny of the republic.

It seems to me exaltation of character, dignification of labor,
material prosperity, leaving social equality to take care of itself,
makes up the best solution of the negro problem. Social equality does
take care of itself even among the white races. Some of you may have a
white servant who is a good woman, a Christian woman, you expect to
meet her in heaven (if you get there), but she is not admitted to your
social set.

There is a vast difference between social rights and civil rights.
Near Lexington, Ky., where I claim my home, is the country residence
of J.B. Haggin, the multi-millionaire horseman. Soon after the
completion of his mansion home, he gave a reception which cost
thousands of dollars. The "first cut" of society came from far and
near, but I was not invited, nor did I feel slighted, for I had no
claim upon the millionaire magnate socially. But when I meet the great
turf-king on the turnpike, he in his limozine and I in my little
runabout, I say, "Mr. Haggin, give me half the road, sir." Inside his
gates I have no claim, but outside, the turnpike's free, and J.B.
Haggin can't run over me. So the negro has no claim on the white man
for social equality, but he has a right to the key of knowledge and a
chance in the world.

Slavery was not an unmixed evil. Like the famed shield it had two
sides. While it had its blighting effects it had its blessings. In
bondage the negro was taught to speak the English language, and in
childhood had the association of white children with their southern
home training. They were taught two valuable lessons, industry and
obedience, without which liberty means license. The negro was
compelled to work and obey, two lessons the Indian never had and never
respected. Beside these valuable lessons the negro was taught the
fundamental principles of Christianity and at the opening of the war
nearly every negro belonged to some church. Their preachers used to
get their dictionary and Bible very amusingly mixed at times. Drake
and the bold cavaliers of that day probably found that it paid
better to rob the Spaniard of the gold and silver ready made in the
shape of "the Acapulco galleon," or such like, than to sift the soil
of the Sacramento for its precious grains. At all events, the wonderful
richness of the "earth" seems to have been completely overlooked
or forgotten. So little was it suspected, until the Americans acquired
the country at the peace with Mexico, that in the fourth volume
of Knight's _National Cyclopædia_, published early in 1848, in speaking
of Upper California, it is said, "very little mineral wealth has
been met with"! A few months after, intelligence reached Europe
how much the reverse was the case.

THE DISPUTED PASSAGE PROM THE TEMPEST.

(Vol. ii., pp. 259. 299.)
When the learning and experience of such gentlemen as MR. SINGER and
MR.
COLLIER fail to conclude a question, there is no higher appeal than
to plain common sense, aided by the able arguments advanced on each
side.
Under these circumstances, perhaps you will allow one who is neither
learned nor experienced to offer a word or two by way of vote on the
meaning of the passage in the _Tempest_ cited by MR. SINGER. It
appears to me that to do full justice to the question the passage
should be quoted entire, which, with your permission, I will do.

"_Fer._ There be some sports are painful; and their labour Delight
in them sets off: some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone; and
most poor matters Point to rich ends.

This, my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The
mistress, which I serve, quickens what's dead And makes my labours
pleasures: O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
And he's compos'd of harshness.

I must remove Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up Upon
a sore injunction: my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work,
and says, such baseness Had ne'er like executor.

_I forget_; _But_ these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labour(s),
Most busy(l)est when I do it."

The question appears to be whether "most busy" applies to "sweet
thoughts" or to Ferdinand, and whether the pronoun "it" refers to
the act of _forgetting_ or to "labour(s);" and I must confess
that, to me, the whole significancy of the passage depends upon the
idea conveyed of the mind being "most busy" while the body is being
exerted.

Every man with a spark of imagination must many a time have felt
this.

In the most essential particular, therefore, I think MR. SINGER is right
in his correction but at the same time agreeing with MR. COLLIER,
that it is desirable not to interfere with the original text further
than is absolutely necessary, I think the substitution of "labour" for
"labours" is of questionable expediency. What is the use of the
conjunction "but" if not to connect the excuse for the act of
forgetting with the act itself?

Without intending to follow MR. COLLIER through the course of his
argument, I should like to notice one or two points. The usage of
Shakspeare's day admitted many variations from the stricter grammatical
rules of our own; but no usage ever admitted such a sentence as this,--for
though elliptically expressed, MR. COLLIER treats it as a sentence,--

"Most busy, least when I do it."
This is neither grammar nor sense: and I persist in believing that
Shakspeare was able to construct an intelligible sentence according
to rules as much recognised by custom then as now.

But, indeed, does not MR. COLLIER virtually admit that the text is
inexplicable in his very attempt to explain it? He sums up by saying
"that in fact, his toil is no toil, and that when he is 'most busy'
he 'least does it,'" which is precisely the reverse of what the text
says, if it express any meaning at all. I will agree with him in
preferring the old text to any other text where it gives a perfect
meaning; but to prefer it here, when the omission of a single letter
produces an image at once {338} noble and complete, would,
to my mind, savour more of superstition than true worship.

P.S. It should be observed that MR. COLLIER'S "least" is as much of
an alteration of the original text as MR. SINGER'S "busyest", the one
adding and the other omittng a letter. The folio of 1632, where it
differs front the first folio, will hardly add to the authority of MR.
COLLIER himself.

SAMUEL HICKSON.

Oct. 10. 1850.

If one, who is but a charmed listener to Shakspeare, may presume
to offer an opinion to practised interpreters, I should suggest to
MR. SINGER and MR.

COLLIER, another and a totally different reading of the passage
in discussion by them from the exquisite opening scene of the 3d Act
of the _Tempest_.

There can be little doubt that "most busy" applies more poetically to
_thoughts_ than to _labours_; and, in so much, MR.

SINGER'S reading is to be commended. But it is equally true that,
by adhering to the early text, MR. COLLIER'S school of editing has
restored force and beauty to many passages which had previously been
outraged by fancied improvements, so that his unflinching support of
the original word in this instance is also to be respected. But may
not both be combined? I think they may, by understanding the passage
in question as though a transposition had taken place between the
words "least" and "when".

"Most busy _when least_ I do it,"
or,--
"Most busy when least employed."
forming just the sort of verbal antithesis of which the poet was
so fond.

An actual transposition of the words may have taken place through the
fault of the early printers; but even if the _present order_ be preserved,
still the _transposed sense_ is, I think, much less difficult than
the forced and rather contradictory meaning contended for by MR.
COLLIER. Has not _the pause_ in Ferdinand's labour been hitherto too
much overlooked? What is it that has induced him to _forget_ his task?
Is it not those delicious thoughts, most busy in the _pauses_ of
labour, making those pauses still more refreshing and renovating?

Ferdinand says--
"I forget,"--
and then he adds, _by way of excuse_,--
"_But_ the sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busy
when least I do it."

More busy in thought when idle, than in labour when employed.

The cessation from labour was favourable to the thoughts that made it
endurable.

Malone quarrelled with the word "but", for which he would have substituted
"and" or "for". But in the _apologetic_ sense which I would confer upon
the last two lines of Ferdinand's speech, the word "but", at their
commencement, becomes not only appropriate but necessary.

"LONDON BRIDGE IS BROKEN DOWN."
(Vol. ii., p. 258.)
Your correspondent T.S.D. does not remember to have seen that
interesting old nursery ditty "London Bridge is broken down"
printed, or even referred to in print. For the edification then
of all interested in the subject, I send you the following.

The old song on "London Bridge" is printed in Ritson's _Gammer Gurton's
Garland_, and in Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes of England_; but both
copies are very imperfect. There are also some fragments preserved in
the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for September, 1823 (vol. xciii. p. 232.),
and in the _Mirror_ for November 1st of the same year. From these
versions a tolerably perfect copy has been formed, and printed in a
little work, for which I am answerable, entitled _Nursery Rhymes,
with the Tunes to which they are still sung in the Nurseries of
England_.

But the whole ballad has probably been formed by many fresh additions
in a long series of years, and is, perhaps, almost interminable
when received in all its different versions.

The correspondent of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ remarks, that "London
Bridge is broken down" is an old ballad which, more than seventy
years previous, he had heard plaintively warbled by a lady who was
born in the reign of Charles II., and who lived till nearly that
of George II.

Another correspondent to the same magazine, whose contribution,
signed "D.," is inserted in the same volume (December, p. 507.),
observes, that the ballad concerning London Bridge formed, in his
remembrance, part of a Christmas carol, and commenced thus:--
"Dame, get up and bake your pies, On Christmas Day in the morning."

The requisition, he continues, goes on to the dame to prepare for
the feast, and her answer is--
"London Bridge is broken down, On Christmas Day in the morning."

The inference always was, that until the bridge was rebuilt some
stop would be put to the dame's Christmas operations; but why the
falling of a part of London Bridge should form part of a Christmas
carol it is difficult to determine.

A Bristol correspondent, whose communication is inserted in that
delightful volume the _Chronicles of London Bridge_ (by Richard
Thomson, of the London Institution), says,--
"About forty years ago, one moonlight night, in a street in Bristol,
his attention was attracted by dance {339} and chorus of boys and
girls, to which the words of this ballad gave measure.

The breaking down of the bridge was announced as the dancers moved
round in a circle, hand in hand; and the question, 'How shall we
build it up again?'

was chanted by the leader, whilst the rest stood still."
Concerning the antiquity of this ballad, a modern writer remarks,--

"If one might hazard a conjecture concerning it, we should refer
its composition to some very ancient date, when, London Bridge
lying in ruins, the office of bridge master was vacant, and his
power over the river Lea (for it is doubtless that river which is
celebrated in the chorus to this song) was for a while at an end.

But this, although the words and melody of the verses are extremely
simple, is all uncertain."
If I might hazard another conjecture, I would refer it to the
period when London Bridge was the scene of a terrible contest between
the Danes and Olave of Norway. There is an animated description of
this "Battle of London Bridge," which gave ample theme to the Scandinavian
scalds, in _Snorro Sturleson_; and, singularly enough, the first
line is the same as that of our ditty:--
"London Bridge is broken down; Gold is won and bright renown;
Shields resounding, War horns sounding, Hildur shouting in the din;
Arrows singing, Mail-coats ringing, Odin makes our Olaf win."
See Laing's _Heimskringla_, vol. ii. p. 10.; and Bulwer's _Harold_,
vol. i.
p. 59. The last-named work contains, in the notes, some excellent
remarks upon the poetry of the Danes, and its great influence upon our
early national muse.

EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.

[T.S.D.'s inquiry respecting this once popular nursery song has
brought us a host of communications; but none which contain the precise
information upon the subject which is to be found in DR. RIMBAULT's
reply. TOBY, who kindly forwards the air to which it was sung, speaks
of it as a "'lullaby song,' well-known in the southern part of
Kent and in Lincolnshire."
E.N.W. says it is printed in the collection of _Nursery Rhymes_
published by Burns, and that he was born and bred in London, and
that it was one of the nursery songs he was amused with. NOCAB
ET AMICUS, two old fellows of the Society of Antiquaries, do not doubt
that it refers to some event preserved in history, especially, they
add, as we have a faint recollection "of a note, touching such an
event, in an almost used-up English history, which was read in our
nursery by an elder brother, something less than three-fourths of a
century since.
And we have also a shrewd suspicion that the sequel of the song has
reference to the reconstruction of that fabric at a later date."

J.S.C. has sent us a copy of the song; and we are indebted for
another copy to AN ENGLISH MOTHER, who has accompanied it with notices
of some other popular songs, notices which at some future opportunity
we shall lay before our readers.--ED.]

ARABIC NUMERALS.

(Vol. ii., pp. 27. 61.)
I must apologise for adding anything to the already abundant
articles which have from time to time appeared in "NOTES AND QUERIES"
on this interesting subject; I shall therefore confine myself to
a few brief remarks on the _form_ of each character, and, if
possible, to show from what alphabets they are derived:-- 
1.

This most natural form of the first numeral is the first character
in the Indian, Arabic, Syriac, and Roman systems.

2.

This appears to be formed from the Hebrew [Hebrew: b], which, in the
Syriac, assumes nearly the form of our 2; the Indian character is
identical, but arranged vertically instead of horizontally.

3. This is clearly derived from the Indian and Arabic forms, the position
being altered, and the vertical stroke omitted.

4.

This character is found as the fourth letter in the Phoenician and
ancient Hebrew alphabets: the Indian is not very dissimilar.
5. and 6.

These bear a great resemblance to the Syriac Heth and Vau (a
hook). When erected, the Estrangelo-Syriac Vau is precisely the form
of our 6.

7. This figure is derived from the Hebrew [Hebrew: z], zayin, which
in the Estrangelo-Syriac is merely a 7 reversed.

8. This figure is merely a rounded form of the Samaritan Kheth (a
travelling scrip, with a string tied round thus, [Character]). The
Estrangelo-Syriac [Character] also much resembles it.

9. Identical with the Indian and Arabic.

0. Nothing; vacuity. It probably means the orb or _boundary_ of the
earth.--10. is the first boundary, [Hebrew: tchwm], Tekum, [Greek:
Deka], Decem, "terminus." Something more yet remains to be said, I
think, on the _names_ of the letters. Cf. "Table of Alphabets" in
Gesenius, _Lex_., ed.
Tregelles, and "NOTES AND QUERIES," Vol. i., p. 434.

E. S. T.

_Arabic Numerals._--With regard to the subject of Arabic numerals, and
the instance at Castleacre (Vol. ii., pp. 27. 61.), I think I may
safely say that no archæologist of the present day would allow, after
seeing the original, that it was of the date 1084, even if it were not
so certain that these numerals were not in use at that time. I fear
"the acumen of Dr.
Murray" was wasted on the occasion referred to in Mr.

Bloom's work. It is a very far-fetched idea, that the visitor must
cross himself to discover the meaning of the figures; not to mention
the inconvenience, I might say impossibility, {340} of reading them
after he had turned his back upon them,--the position required to
bring them into the order 1084. It is also extremely improbable
that so obscure a part of the building should be chosen for erecting
the date of the foundation; nor is it likely that so important a
record would be merely impressed on the plaister, liable to destruction
at any time.

Read in the most natural way, it makes 1480: but I much doubt its being
a date at all. The upper figure resembles a Roman I; and this, with the
O beneath, may have been a mason's initials at some time when the
plaister was renewed: for that the figures are at least sixty years
later than the supposed date, Mr. Bloom confesses, the church not
having been built until then.

CAXTON'S PRINTING-OFFICE.

(Vol. ii., pp. 99. 122. 142. 187. 233.)

I confess, after having read MR. J.G. NICHOLS' critique in a recent
number of the "NOTES AND QUERIES," relative to the locality of the
first printing-press erected by Caxton in this country, I am not
yet convinced that it was not within the Abbey of Westminster. From
MR. NICHOLS' own statements, I find that Caxton himself says his
books were "imprynted" by him in the Abbey; to this, however,
MR. NICHOLS replies by way of objection, "that Caxton does not say
in the church of the Abbey."
On the above words of Caxton "in the Abbey of Westminster," Mr.
C. Knight, in his excellent biography of the old printer, observes,
"they leave no doubt that beneath the actual roof of some portion of
the Abbey he carried on his art." Stow says "that Caxton was the first
that carried on his art in the Abbey." Dugdale, in his _Monasticon_,
speaking of Caxton, says, "he erected his office in one of the side
chapels of the Abbey." MR. NICHOLS, quoting from Stow, also informs
us that printing-presses were, soon after the introduction of the
art, erected in the Abbey of St.

Albans, St.
Augustin at Canterbury, and other monasteries; he also informs us that
the scriptorium of the monasteries had ever been the manufactory
of books, and these places it is well known formed a portion of the
abbeys themselves, and were not in detached buildings similar to
the Almonry at Westminster, which was situated some two or three
hundred yards distant from the Abbey.

I think it very likely, when the press was to supersede the pen in
the work of book-making, that its capabilities would be first tried
in the very place which had been used for the object it was designed
to accomplish.

This idea seems to be confirmed by the tradition that a printer's office
has ever been called a chapel, a fact which is beautifully alluded to
by Mr. Creevy in his poem entitled _The Press_:--
"Yet stands the chapel in yon Gothic shrine, Where wrought the
father of our English line, Our art was hail'd from kingdoms far
abroad, And cherish'd in the hallow'd house of God; From which we
learn the homage it received And how our sires its heavenly birth
believed.

Each printer hence, howe'er unblest his walls, E'en to this day, his
house a chapel calls."
Mr. Nichols acknowledges that what he calls a vulgar error was current
and popular, that in some part of the Abbey Caxton did erect his
press, yet we are expected to submit to the almost unsupported dictum
of that gentleman, and renounce altogether the old and almost universal
idea. With respect to his alarm that the _vulgar error_ is about to
be further propagated by an engraving, wherein the mistaken draftsman
has deliberately represented the printers at work within the consecrated
walls of the church itself, I may be permitted to say, on behalf of
the painter, that he has erected his press not even on the basement
of one of the Abbey chapels, but in an upper story, a beautiful screen
separating the workplace from the more sacred part of the building.

COLD HARBOUR.

(Vol. i., p. 60.; Vol. ii., p. 159.)
I beg leave to inform you that Yorkshire has its "Cold Harbour," and
for the origin of the term, I subjoin a communication sent me by my
father:--
"When a youngster, I was a great seeker for etymologies. A solitary
farm-house and demesne were pointed out to me, the locality of which
was termed Cad, or Cudhaber, or Cudharber. Conjectures, near akin to
those now presented, occurred to me. I was invited to inspect the
locality.

I dined with the old yeoman (aged about eighty) who occupied the
farm. He gave me the etymology. In his earlier days he had come to
this farm; a house was not built, yet he was compelled by
circumstances to bring over part of his farming implements, &c. He,
with his men-servants, had no other shelter at the time than a
dilapidated barn. When they assembled to eat their cold provisions,
the farmer cried out, 'Hegh lads, but there's cauld (or caud) harbour
here.' The spot had no name previously. The rustics were amused
by the farmer's saying. Hence the locality was termed by them Cold
Harbour, corrupted, Cadharber, and the etymon remains to this day.
This information put an end to my enquiries about Cold Harbour."
C.M.J.

_Cold Harbour._--The goldfinches which have remained among the valleys
of the Brighton Downs during the winter are called, says Mr. {341} Knox,
by the catchers, "harbour birds, meaning that they have sojourned
or harboured, as the local expression is, here during the season."
Does not this, with the fact of a place in Pembroke being called Cold
Blow, added to the many places with the prefix Cold, tend to
confirm the supposition that the numerous cold harbours were places
of protection against the winter winds?

A.C.

With regard to Cold Harbour (supposed "Coluber," which is by no means
satisfactory), it may be worth observing that Cold is a common prefix:
thus there is Cold Ashton, Cold Coats, Cold or Little Higham, Cold
Norton, Cold Overton, Cold Waltham, Cold St.

Aldwins, --coats, --meere, --well, --stream, and several _cole_,
&c.

Cold peak is a hill near Kendall. The latter suggests to me a _Query_
to genealogists. Was the old baronial name of Peche, Pecche,
of Norman origin as in the Battle Roll? From the fact of the Peak of
Derby having been Pech-e _antè_ 1200, I think this surname must
have been local, though it soon became soft, as appears from the rebus
of the Lullingstone family, a peach with the letter é on it. I do not
think that _k_ is formed to similar words in Domesday record.

Caldecote, a name of several places, may require explanation.

AUG. CAMB.

I beg to give you the localities of two "Cold Harbours:" one on the
road from Uxbridge to Amersham, 19½ miles from London (see Ordnance
Map 7.); the other on the road from Chelmsford to Epping, 13½ miles
from the former place (see Ordnance Map No. 1.

N.W.).

DISS.

There are several Cold Harbours in Sussex, in Dallington, Chiddingly,
Wivelsfield, one or two in Worth, one S.W. of Bignor, one N.E. of
Hurst Green, and there may be more.
In Surrey there is one in the parish of Bletchingley.
WILLIAM FIGG.
There is a farm called Cold Harbour, near St. Albans, Herts.

S.A.
After the numerous and almost tedious theories concerning Cold
Harbours, particularly the "forlorn hope" of the _Coal Depôts_ in
London and elsewhere, permit me to suggest one of almost universal
application.
Respecting _here-burh_, an inland station for an army, in the same
sense as a "harbour" for ships on the sea-coast, a word still
sufficiently familiar and intelligible, the question seems to be
settled; and the French "auberge" for an inn has been used as an
illustration, though the first syllable may be doubtful. The principal
difficulty appears to consist in the prefix "Cold;" for why, it may
be asked, should a bleak and "cold" situation be selected as a
"harbour"? The fact probably is that this spelling, however common,
is a corruption for "COL.". Colerna, in Wiltshire, fortunately
retains the original orthography, and in Anglo-Saxon literally
signifies the habitation or settlement of a colony; though in some
topographical works we are told that it was formerly written "Cold
Horne," and that it derives its name from its bleak situation. This,
however, is a mere coincidence; for some of these harbours are in
warm sheltered situations. Sir R.C. Hoare was right when he observed,
that these "harbours" were generally near some Roman road or Roman
settlement. It is therefore wonderful that it should not at once
occur to every one conversant with the Roman occupation of this
island, that all these "COL-harbours" mark the settlements, farms,
outposts, or garrisons of the Roman colonies planted
here.

J.I.

Oxford.
_Cold Harbour._--Your correspondent asks whether there is a "Cold
Harbour" in every county, &c."God bless them, for their brawny hands
  Have built the glory of all lands;
  And richer are their drops of sweat,
  Than diamonds in a coronet."

I must say, however, all the fault for present conditions must not be
charged to capital. There are faults within I wish the laboring world
would see and correct. I travel the country over and note the men who
file in and out the saloons. Are they bankers or leading business men?
No, they are laborers from factories, furnaces, fields and work-shops,
spending their money for what is worse than nothing and giving it to a
business that pays labor less and robs more than any other
capitalization in the world.

The New York Sun says: "Every successful man in Wall Street is a total
abstainer. He knows he must keep his brain free from alcohol when he
enters the Stock Exchange, where his mind goes like a driving wheel
from which the belt has slipped." The laboring man needs brain as
clear and nerves as steady as the capitalist if he expects to win in
this age of sharp competition.

What the laboring classes in this country spend for liquor in twelve
months would purchase five hundred of the average manufactories of the
land; what they spend in ten years would purchase five thousand, and
what they spend in twenty years would control the entire manufacturing
interests of the country.

A few years ago a strike occurred with the Pullman Palace Car Company.
What the laboring classes spend for intoxicating liquors in three
months would purchase the Pullman Palace Car Company and all its
rolling stock. Instead of a strike, in which laboring men are out of
work and families suffering for the necessaries of life, why not stop
drinking beer and whiskey for ninety days, buy the whole business and
let the Pullman Company do something else. How to husband the
resources of the poor is far more important than the right use of the
fortunes of the rich. There is less danger in the massing of money by
the rich than there is in wasting the wages of the working world in
saloons.

Now I have already thrown the searchlight upon enough problems for you
to realize I have given you an incongruous picture. You must be
impressed with the conflicting forces at work upon our republic. Never
have we had so many advocates of peaceful arbitration for differences
between nations and never such armament for war; never such an
accumulation of comforts, never such a multiplication of wants; never
so much done to make men honest, never so many thieves. In 1850 seven
thousand in our penitentiaries; in 1860 twenty thousand; in 1870
thirty-two thousand; in 1880 fifty-eight thousand; in 1890 eighty-two
thousand, and in 1900 one hundred thousand. In London, England, last
year with over seven millions of people, twenty-four murders; in
Chicago, one hundred and eighteen. There are more murders in this
republic than in any civilized land beneath the sky. Yet in face of
all these unsettled questions, with advancement along all social,
moral, intellectual and religious lines I have faith to believe this
twentieth century American citizenship will prove itself sufficiently
thoughtful, testful and tactful to deal with all national issues as
one by one they come within reach of practical politics, and that this
country is big enough, brave enough, wise enough and just enough to
solve every problem vexing us today.

Some have not this faith. They see an army of three hundred thousand
tramps eating bread by the sweat of other men's brows; the slums of
great cities, cradles of infamy where children are trained to sin; the
"fire-damp of combination trusts" stifling the working world; gambling
brokers cornering the markets in the necessaries of life; the wages of
working girls being such as to lead many from life's Eden of purity; a
great battle on between labor and capital and in this combination of
threatening dangers they see the overthrow of free government.

If these pessimists would take a view from the nether standpoint and
see what we have come through as a country their fears would be
dispelled.

Look backward fifty years from today and see the republic wrapped in
the throes of civil strife; the soil of our Southland soaked with
blood and tears; the nation overwhelmed with debt; four million
negroes turned loose penniless in the South to beg bread at the white
man's door, and he already on "Poverty row;" Abraham Lincoln dead in
the White House, shot down by an assassin; the Secretary of War
bleeding from three stab wounds the same night; and Columbia reeling
on her throne.

Now see the harmonious association of all sections; a firmer
establishment of this "government of the people, by the people and for
the people" than was ever known. Look over the ocean and see Turkey's
massacre of the Armenians, Russia with her Siberian horrors, Spain
with her cruelty to the Moors and Jews; or look closer home over the
Mexican border and see the government torn to tatters and public men
shot down like dogs. Then turn and note our country's magnanimous
dealings with Cuba; her teachers schooling Filipinos into nobler life;
our President leading the armies of Russia and Japan out of the rivers
of blood; slavery gone, lottery gone, polygamy outlawed, the saloon
iniquity tottering to its fall; hospitals nestled in shadows of
bereavement, hungry children fed on their way to school, and men who
know how to make money, giving it away for the relief of suffering and
uplift of mankind as never before. Don't tell me the world is getting
worse.

I was in New York City for two weeks at the time of the Titanic
disaster. On Saturday evening before the ocean tragedy I stood on the
elevated at the corner of Thirty-third and Broadway. The "Great White
Way" was thronged with pleasure-seekers, crowding their way to
theatres and picture shows. It seemed to me I never saw the great city
so gay. But, on Monday morning after, there came on ether waves the
appalling news that the finest ship in the world had gone down, and
sixteen hundred human beings had gone with it. I never witnessed such
a transformation. It seemed to me every woman had tears in her eyes,
and every man a lump in his throat. Actors played to empty houses that
evening; a pall hung over the great Metropolis. But when details came,
with them came the triumph of humanity. The rich had died for the
poor, the strong had died for the weak.

John Jacob Astor had turned away from his fine mansion on Fifth
Avenue, his summer home at Newport, his hundred millions of dollars in
wealth, and was found spending his last moments saving women and
children. All honor to the brave young bridegroom who carried his
bride to a life boat, said, "good-bye sweetheart," kissed her and
stepping back went down with the ship. All hail to that loyal loving
Hebrew wife and mother, Mrs. Straus, who holding to her husband's arm
said: "I would rather die with you than live without you." Like Ruth
of old, she said: "Where thou goest, I will go; where thou diest I
will die, and there will I be buried." There side by side at the ocean
gateway to eternity these old lovers went down together.

Ah! this republic will never perish while we have such manhood and
womanhood to live and die for its honor.

It has been said: "We live in a materialistic age; that all human
activities are born of selfishness; that manhood is dying out of the
world." All over the land at midnight, men lean from the saddles of
iron horses, peering down the railroad track, ready to die if need be
for the safety of those entrusted to their care. Firemen will climb
ladders tonight and their souls will go up in flames, like Jim
Bludsoe's, to save the lives of imperiled women and children.

Look at the orchestra on board the Titanic. When the supreme moment of
danger came, they rushed to the deck, not to put on life belts, not to
get into lifeboats but to form in order, and send out over the icy
ocean, the music of the sweet song, "Nearer, my God, to Thee." When
the ship lifted at one end and started on its headlong dive of
twenty-seven hundred fathoms to the depths of the salty sea, those
brave men, without a discordant note, sent out the sweet refrain;

  "Now let the way appear
  Steps unto Heaven;
  All that Thou sendest me,
  In mercy given;
  Angels to beckon me,
  Nearer, my God to thee;
  Near to Thee."

May we not hope those brave musicians and those who died that others
might live, "On joyful wings cleaving the sky," ocean and icebergs
forgot _did_ upward fly, and on their flight to the spirit world
continued the song, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."

Manhood is not dying out of the world.

Students of history are asking, "Will the fate of Rome be repeated in
the history of this republic?" The answer is, we have saving
influences in this republic Rome never knew. Rome never had an asylum
for her blind or insane; she never had a home for widows and orphans;
her "golden house" of Nero never had an equal, but nowhere in her
dusty highways could be found footprints of mercy. In Rome the soldier
was the cohesive power, while socially everything was isolated. In
this republic there is an interlacing and binding together in bonds of
human brotherhood. A Methodist here bound to Methodists everywhere,
Presbyterian to Presbyterian, Baptist to Baptist, Disciple to
Disciple, Lutheran to Lutheran, Catholic to Catholic, Masons, Odd
Fellows, Knights of Pythias, Red Men, Maccabees, Woodmen, Christian
Endeavor Societies, Epworth Leagues, Y.M.C.A.'s, W.C.T.U.'s, and many
other fraternities, making up an interdependent, together-woven,
God-allied and God-saving influence ancient empires never dreamt of.
These are the moral lightning rods that avert from this republic the
wrath of God.

Am I putting too much stress upon the humanity side of national life?
Do you tell me money is the great question of this country, tariff the
great question? Bring me the Bible and what do I find? Only a very few
pages given to the creation of the material universe, with all its
gold and silver, suns and systems, but I find page after page, chapter
after chapter, and book after book, given to the healing of the lame,
the halt and the blind, teaching a kindred spirit of sympathy to meet
the common woes of humanity.

What I am about to say may seem more like sermon than lecture, but I
believe it will be the best thing I have said when the lecture closes.
In the formula of human touch, laid down in the life of Jesus of
Nazareth, there is more saving influence for national endurance than
in all the wealth of our country's treasury.

From the time His beautiful mother wrapped Him in coarse linen, and
cradled Him on cattle straw in that Bethlehem barn, on up to His death
on the cross, He was ever touching the masses, healing their diseases,
soothing their sorrows and teaching the lesson, "the more humanity you
place at the bottom the better citizenship you will have at the top."
In the golden rule of this human touch lies the hope of this home of
the free.

A little boy boarded a car in New York City. A few feet from him sat a
finely-dressed lady and as the boy stared at her, he moved nearer and
nearer until he was close beside her.

"What do you mean by getting so close to me? Don't you see you have
put mud on my dress from your shoes? Move away," said the lady.

The little urchin replied: "I'm so sorry I got mud on your dress; I
didn't mean to do it."

"Where are you going, all by your little self, anyway?"

"I'm going to my aunt's where I live."

"Have you no mother?"

"No mam; she died four weeks ago. I ain't got any mother now, and
that's why I was settin' up close to you to make believe you wuz my
mother. I'm sorry 'bout the mud, you'll 'scuse me, won't you, good
lady?"

The woman extending her hand said: "Yes I will; come here," and soon
her arm was about him, and tears in her eyes, and the boy could have
wiped his feet on any dress in that car without rebuke. We want more
of human touch in national and individual life.

A tramp called at a fine home for his supper. The owner said: "You can
have something to eat provided you do some work beforehand."

"What can I do," asked the "hobo."

A set of harness was given him to clean. The gentleman went to his
supper, and soon after a blue-eyed, golden-haired girl of four years
came out, and approaching the tramp, said: "Good evening, sir. Is you
got a little girl like me?"

"No, I am all alone in the world."

"Ain't you got no mama and papa?"

"No, they died a long time ago," and the tramp wiped away a tear as
memory came rolling up from out the hallowed past.

"Oh! I'm so sorry for you, 'cause I have a home and papa and mama."

The man of the house came out, and looking at the harness said:
"That's a good job; you must have done that work before. Come in and
you shall have a good supper."

The little tot ran around to the front gate, where a pair of horses,
hitched to a carriage, waited to take the family on a drive. The tramp
finished his supper and passing out, the little one in the carriage
said: "Good-bye, mister. When you want supper again you come and see
us, won't you;" and turning to the driver she said: "He ain't got no
papa, nor mama, no little girl and no home."

The tramp, who heard these words taking off his old hat bowed low to
the little one who had spoken the kind words.

A few minutes later while standing on a street corner, wondering where
he could spend the night, some one shouted, "Horses running away!" The
driver had left the team and the horses started with the little girl
alone in the carriage, screaming for help. Men ran out but the mad
horses cleared the track. The tramp fixed himself, and as the team
swept by, he gave a bound and caught the bit of the nearest horse. The
horses reared and plunged but the tramp held on, until he swerved them
to the sidewalk. As the near horse struck the curb he fell and the
tramp was crushed beneath the horse. A physician came and as he bent
over to examine the heart, the tramp said: "Was the little one saved?"

The child was brought and as her sweet blue eyes tenderly looked at
the face of the dying man he smiled, and then the spirit took its
flight, to where He who died to save the world, looked with compassion
upon the tramp who gave his life for "one of these little ones."

Oh, the beauty and power of human touch!

The Panama Canal is considered the glory crowning achievement of this
century; but the building of a highway of sympathy over which to send
help to the hopeless is a far greater achievement. If this republic is
to endure with the stars; if it is to go down the ages like a
broadening colonade of light, and stand in steady splendor at the
height of the world's civilization; it will not be because of its
money standard, its tariff or expansion policy, but because the
heart-beat of human brotherhood sends the blood of a common father
bounding through the veins of the concentrated whole of humanity,
binding high and low, rich and poor, weak and strong together.

  "Work brothers; sisters work; work hand and brain,
  We'll win the golden age again;
  And love's millennial morn shall rise
  In happy hearts and blessed eyes.
  We will, we will, brave champions be
  In this the lordlier chivalry."


III

OUR COUNTRY, OUR HOMES AND OUR DUTY. A PLEA FOR THE HOME AGAINST THE
SALOON.


The sweetest word in the language we speak is home. No matter in what
clime or country, whether where sunbeams dance and play or frost fiend
rules the air, there's no place like home. At the World's Fair in
Chicago I visited the Eskimo village. To a woman who could speak
English I said: "How do you like this country?"

"Beautiful, beautiful country. Oh, the flowers, the green grass, the
lovely homes!" was her reply.

But when I ventured to ask: "Will you remain here after the fair and
not return to your land of ice and snow," she shook her head and said:
"No, I want to go home. I am so homesick."

"Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home." In Lexington,
Kentucky, there is a modest looking house, nestled mid linden and
locust trees. Visitors who pass in quest of historic spots about the
far-famed city, seldom give even a glance at that humble abode. Yet
when I am far away, whether in the wonderful west with its scenic
grandeur, or in the east surrounded by mansions of millionaires, my
heart goes back in memory's aeroplane to the old Blue Grass town,
where six generations of my family sleep, the dearest spot on earth to
me--"home, sweet home." When years ago I was nearing the end of a
three months' lecture tour in California, a friend invited me to join
him on a visit to Yosemite Valley, saying: "You will see the grandest
scenery and biggest trees in the world." My reply was: "I thank you
very much, but my engagements in the golden west close on the eighth
and I will start east on the ninth; my old Kentucky home is grander to
me than Yosemite Valley and my baby bigger than any tree in
California."

Someone has said the nearest spot to heaven in this world is a happy
home, where the parents are young and the children small. I don't know
about that. It seems to me a little nearer heaven is the home where
husband and wife have lived long together, where children honor
parents and parents honor God; where the aged wife can look her
husband in the face and give him the sentiment of the dame of John
Anderson:

  "John Anderson, my jo John,
    When we were first acquent;
  Your locks were like the raven,
    Your bonnie brow was brent;
  But now your brow is beld, John,
    Your locks are like the snaw;
  But blessings on your frosty pow,
    John Anderson, my jo.

  "John Anderson, my jo, John,
    We clamb the hill thegither;
  And mony a cantie day, John,
    We've had wi' one anither:
  Now we maun totter down, John,
    And hand in hand we'll go,
  And sleep thegither at the foot,
    John Anderson, my jo."

James A. Garfield said: "It's by the fireside, where calm thoughts
inspired by love of home and love of country, the history of the past,
the hope of the future, God works out the destiny of this republic."

A Spartan general pointing to his army said: "There stand the walls of
Sparta and every man's a brick." Can I not point to the homes of our
country and say: "There stand the walls of this republic and every
home's a brick." Suppose a battery, planted on some eminence outside
this city, were to send a shell through some building every hour; how
long until your beautiful city would be one of crumbling walls and
flying population? On yonder heights of law are planted two hundred
thousand rum batteries, sending shells of destruction through the
homes of the people and every day hundreds of homes are knocked out of
the walls of the republic.

Do you realize what it means when an American home is destroyed by
drink? Some years ago on Sunday afternoon I visited an eastern
penitentiary by invitation of the chaplain. Passing a row of cells my
attention was called to a man whose face bore the marks of
intelligence and refinement. The chaplain said: "That man is an ideal
prisoner and a born gentleman, though here for life. He is the
graduate of an eastern college. He married an accomplished young
woman. In social life he was led into the drink habit, and it grew
upon him until at times he became intoxicated. When under the
influence of liquor his reason was dethroned, and one night in a brawl
he killed a man. He was given a life sentence. Asking permission to
speak he said: 'I have no complaint to make of the verdict, but beg
the privilege of saying, God who knows the secrets of all hearts,
knows I am not a murderer at heart, for I don't know how nor when I
killed my friend.' A few days after he entered this prison his wife
came to visit him. She had with her a sweet little golden-haired
child. As he entered the office in his striped prison garb his wife
fell into his arms; the agony on that man's face I can never forget.
The child shrank from him at first, then recognizing her father, she
ran to him. As he hugged her to his bosom the little one twined her
arms about his neck and said: 'Papa, please come home with us. Mama
cries so much cause you don't come home.' The man sinking into a chair
said: 'O God, am I never to see my home again?'"

This is but one of the thousands of homes destroyed every year by the
drink curse. If I could draw aside the veil and let you look into the
desolate homes of your own city tonight, you would feel Ex-Governor
Hanley of Indiana did not give an overwrought picture when he said:
"Personally, I have seen so much physical ruin, mental blight and
moral corruption from strong drink that I hate the traffic. I hate it
for its arrogance; I hate it for its hypocrisy; I hate it for its
greed and avarice; I hate it for its domination in politics; I hate it
for its disregard of law; I hate it for the load it straps on labor's
back; I hate it for the wounds it has given to genius, for the human
wrecks it has wrought, for the alms-houses it has peopled, for the
prisons it has filled, for the crimes it has committed, the homes it
has destroyed, the hearts it has broken, the malice it has planted in
the hearts of men, and the dead sea fruit with which it starves
immortal souls." With proof of the truth of this phillipic on every
hand, it is a strange anomaly in our government that the degrading
influence of the saloon is linked by law to the elevating influence of
school, church and home.

When Jesus was on earth He came to a fig tree, dressed in rich leaves
but barren of fruit; it was in fig season but the tree had only
leaves. We read that Jesus cursed the tree and it withered. We have in
this country a upas tree named the liquor traffic. It is not a barren
tree, but far worse than barren. Its branches bend with the weight of
its fruit, but not a pint, nor a quart, nor gallon, nor barrel from
its boughs ever benefited a single mortal by its use as a beverage.
Its leaves drip with poison and the bones of its dead victims would
build a pyramid as high as Appenines piled on the Alps. Jesus withered
the tree that produced nothing. We license and cultivate the tree
whose fruitage the Bible compares to the bite of a serpent, the sting
of an adder and the poison of asps.

In the earlier days of the temperance movement, when we discussed the
question along moral lines, the license advocates made it an economic
question, but since the commercial world is fast becoming a great
temperance league, and great industries are blacklisting the saloon as
an enemy of legitimate business, the liquor advocates are taking
refuge behind the Bible, and claiming that He who cursed the tree that
was barren, planted the one whose root and heart, bark and branches
are poisoning the blood of the nation. They pervert scripture, take
isolated passages and present an ominum gatherum of quotations to
prove the Bible indorses the use of strong drink. By the same process
I can prove one of these Bible license scholars should hang himself
and be in haste about it. I read on one page of the Bible, "Judas went
out and hanged himself." On another page I read, "Go thou and do
likewise." And on another, "Whatsoever thou doest, do it quickly."

Against these sacrilegious uses of scripture, I place the estimate of
the fruit of this upas tree from one whose words are unmistakable, and
whose wisdom none can question. Solomon said: "Wine is a _mocker_."
Was there ever a word of more weight in its application? When a boy in
school nothing so vexed me and made me want to fight, as for a boy to
_mock_ me. I remember when one of the prettiest girls in school made
faces at me and _mocked_ me; from that hour I could never see any
beauty in that girl's face, nor have I quite forgiven her to this day.
When the Jews wanted to heap the greatest indignity possible upon
Jesus, when they had driven the nails in His hands, pierced His side,
placed the crown of thorns upon His head and pressed the bitter cup to
His lips, they stood off and _mocked_ Him.

Is wine a mocker? Did Solomon know what he was talking about when he
gave it that detestable name? He added still another word and called
it a deceiver. Does it deceive and mock? It meets a young man at a
social feast, garlands itself with the graces of hospitality, sparkles
in the brilliant jewels of fashion, smiles through the faces of female
beauty, furnishes inspiration for the dance and mingles with music,
mirth and hilarity. Gently it takes the young man by the hand, leads
him down the green, flowery sward of license, filled with the rich
aroma of the wild flowers of life. When it has firmly fixed itself in
his appetite, it begins to strip him of his manhood as hail strips the
trees, and when, with will-power gone, nerves shattered, eyes bleared
and face bloated, he stands with the last vestige of manly beauty
swept from the shattered temple of the soul, it stands off and _mocks_
him. It goes to a home, tramples upon the pure unselfish love of a
wife, enthrones the shadow of a drunkard's poverty upon the
hearth-stone, makes the empty cupboard echo the wail of hungry
children for bread, with its bloody talons marks the door lintels with
the death sentence of an immortal soul, and then stands off and
_mocks_ the home. It goes to the Congress of the United States and
says: "Put upon me the harness of taxation and I'll pull you out of
the mire of national debt, and make the administration of the party in
power a financial success." Then with a government permit, it proceeds
to take out of the pockets of the people five times as much as it pays
the government; creates three-fourths of the country's crimes,
four-fifths of its pauperism, sixty per cent. of its divorces, dooms
to poverty and shame a great army of children, blights rosebuds of
beauty on cheeks of innocence, shatters oaks of manhood, leaves its
polluting taint upon all that it touches, and then stands off and
mocks the republic. Was there ever more meaning condensed into one
brief utterance than in Solomon's warning, "Wine is a mocker, strong
drink is raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise?" Is it
wisdom in this republic to deliberately, for revenue, set in motion
causes that neutralize its progress, waste its forces and destroy the
fireside nurseries of the nation's destiny?

If I were an artist I would now place before you a picture of an ideal
American home. I would not make it the fine mansion on the avenue, nor
would I make it "the old log cabin in the lane." I would make it a
neat country home with garden of flowers, orchard of fruits, a barn
lot with bubbling spring and laughing brook. In the door of this home
I would place an American mother with the youngest of four children in
her arms; the oldest son driving his tired team to the barn, the
second one the cows to the cupping, the daughter spreading the cloth
for tea, and the head of the house sinking the iron-bound bucket in
the well for a draught of cold water when day's work for loved ones is
o'er. Approaching the door a commission appointed by Congress on
political economy lift their hats as the spokesman says: "Madam, are
you mistress of this mansion?"

"I am the wife and mother of this humble home, gentlemen; the man at
the well is my husband."

"Madam, we are commissioned by Congress to investigate the home life
of the country and would like to learn what this home is doing for the
republic."

"Come in, gentlemen, and be seated, while I call my husband. We feel
honored by your visit and would be pleased to have you take tea with
us."

The invitation is readily accepted and after a good country supper the
investigation proceeds. In answer to the question as to the relation
of the home to the welfare of the republic, the head of the house
says: "Gentlemen, we are trying to keep our home pure; it is our
purpose to make our boys patriotic American citizens and our daughters
true American women. We love God and endeavor to keep His
commandments, and this is about all I can say about our home."

"That is well so far, but may we ask what sacrifice would this home be
willing to make for the republic if its flag were in peril?"

The wife exclaims: "You alarm us by your question. Is our country in
danger?"

"Yes, madam. The combined forces of the Old World are nearing our
shores and the republic is in peril."

"Wait, gentlemen, until we talk it over."

The family retires for consultation and soon the mother appears, and
with tears in her eyes says: "Gentlemen, we've decided. Take our
oldest boy, who is eager to go. Take him to the battlefield; if he
falls in defense of his country's flag, come back, we'll kiss the
second one and tell him, 'go fill your brother's place.' Gentlemen, we
love our country next to our God and this home is pledged to this
country's honor."

I say, any country that has such mothers for its patriotism, such
guardians for its homes, should protect these homes and mothers with
all the power of police, all the majesty of law, and any evil that
attempts to destroy these homes ought not to be licensed, but should
be buried as the old Scotch woman would bury the devil--with "face
down, so the more he scratched the deeper he would go."

I am sick of the hollow sentiment, "the hand that rocks the cradle
rules the world," insofar as it relates to the drink problem. If the
hand that rocks the cradle did rule the world, there would not be two
hundred thousand rum-fiend vultures soaring over the cradle homes of
our country today. If a mother could keep her boy in the cradle she
might rule the world, but the trouble is, the boy gets too big for the
cradle and jumps out. In the cradle he's mama's child, coos if mama
coos, and laughs when mama laughs; but out of the cradle he's papa's
boy, swears if papa swears, smokes if papa smokes, drinks if papa
drinks. If papa does none of these things, then the world, ruled by
hands that don't rock cradles, steps in with licensed schools of vice
to teach him to drink.

When General Grant was President of the United States he appointed an
old colored man mail-carrier over a route in the mountains of
Virginia. One day, when in a lonely spot, two robbers faced the negro
and demanded the mail. The old man, lifting himself in his saddle
said:

"Gentlemen, I is de mail-carrier of de United States; you touch dis
darkey and you'll have de whole army of dis government on you in
twenty fo' hours."

Blessed will be the day when every mother in our land can say to the
saloon: "You touch my home and you'll have the police power of this
republic on your heels in twenty-four hours."

But, who is the government? We are told that in the early history of
this country, a country magistrate rode horseback from Maryland to
Washington to consult the government. Going to the White House he was
informed the government was not there. At the Capitol he was informed
the people are the government. He returned home, called the voters of
his county to a meeting in the courthouse and said: "Gentlemen, I have
a very important question I want to present to the government." So I
desire to talk to the government, you voters who are to decide the
policy of this republic regarding the liquor traffic.

An Irishman brought before the court for an assault upon a saloon
keeper was questioned by the judge, who said: "Mr. Dolan, what have
you to say; are you guilty or innocent of the charge made against
you?"

The Irishman replied: "By me soul, judge, I couldn't tell ye. I was
blind, stavin' drunk on the manest whiskey ye iver tasted, yer honor."

"I do not use whiskey of any kind," said the judge.

"Ye don't. Thin I don't think ye are doin' yer duty by such
constituents as meself. Ye license men to sell the stuff; ye ought to
taste the stuff ye license men to sell, thin ye would know how it
makes a gintlemen behave himself."

The judge rapped for order in the court and repeated the question,
"Are you guilty or innocent of the charge?"

"Judge, I'll state the case and let yer honor decide for me, which ye
are hired to do anyway. I was standin' by the corner of the strate on
me way home from work, when I spied the bottles in the window of the
saloon. The sight of thim bottles made me thirsty, so I wint in and
took a drink. Jist thin three other thirsty ones came in and I took a
drink with thim; thin they took a drink with me and we kept on
drinkin' till we thought we were back in auld Ireland at Donnybrook
Fair. Whenever we saw a head we struck it and I suppose this
gintlemin's head came my way. Now here's the case, judge. If I hadn't
taken the whiskey, I wouldn't a been in the row, for I'm always
paceable whin sober; if the saloon hadn't been there I wouldn't have
taken the whiskey; and if the Court hadn't licensed the saloon it
wouldn't have been there. Ye can take the case, sir."

What makes the drunkard? The drink. What supplies the drink? The
saloon. What makes the saloon? The law. Who makes the law? The
legislator. Who makes the legislator? The voter. It's the "House that
Jack built," only I will change the verbage a little. Intemperance is
the fire the devil built. Strong drink is the fuel that feeds the fire
the devil built. Distilleries, breweries and saloons are the axes that
cut the fuel that feeds the fire the devil built. License laws are
molds that cast the axes, that cut the fuel that feeds the fire the
devil built. License voters and legislators are the patentees who
invented the molds that cast the axes that cut the fuel that feeds the
fire the devil built. Prohibition ballots are the sledge hammers
destined to destroy the molds that cast the axes that cut the fuel
that feeds the fire the devil built.

There is a chain of responsibility running through the drink question
which many good men fail to recognize. You know a chain is made up of
links welded together. The drunkard is only one link; he is not a
chain. When you link him to the drink then you begin the chain; the
drunkard comes from the drink. That is not all of the chain however;
the drink is linked to the saloon. If you have the saloon, you have
the drink, you have the drunkard. This is not all of the chain; you
have the license law. If you have the license law, you have the
saloon, you have the drink, you have the drunkard. There is yet
another link; the license law is linked to the license voter. The
drunkard comes from the drink, the drink comes from the saloon, the
saloon from the law, and law from the license voter. Who are the
license voters? Many of them are Christian men on their way to heaven;
but the trouble with them is the other end of the chain is going
another road. "No drunkard can enter the kingdom of heaven."

I know it is a common remark that this is a free country, and if a man
chooses to drink, let him do so and take the consequences. If one
could take alone the consequences of his sin there might be some claim
to personal liberty. But when a man's liberty involves another life
the scene changes. A young man may commit a sin in social life and by
reform be forgiven, but when that other life involved in his sin, is
seen in after years, walking the streets in painted shame, reproducing
the consequences of that man's sin, memory and conscience will combine
to give him waking hours while the world sleeps. A man may never enter
a saloon, never take a drink of intoxicating liquor, but if he votes
for the saloon his life becomes involved in the consequences of the
saloon. What are the consequences? Here is a sample. After a three
days' blizzard in one of our large cities a reformer visited a morgue
and seeing a large clothes-hamper full of dead babies he said: "What
does this mean?"

The reply came: "They were gathered from the drunkards' hovels of the
city this morning."

The visitor tells us: "Their bodies were frozen, and several arms were
sticking up out of the basket as if reaching out after life and love."

The streets of our city slums are rivers along whose shores at
midnight can be heard the death gurgle of helpless little ones, while
poverty's row is full of children cursed by inheritance, who are not
living but merely existing by scraping the moss of bare subsistence
from empty buckets in wells of poverty; and the air is freighted with
oaths and obscenities from demonized men and demi-monde women who pour
the poison of their blood into the social life of city slums.

I was both grieved and amazed when I read from the pen of a brilliant
Kentucky editor an editorial denouncing as tyrannical a sumptuary law
that "denies to a citizen the right to order his home, his meat, his
drink, his clothing, according to his conscience." I wonder if the
great editor ever considered the sumptuary law of the saloon. Every
woman who fills the holy office of wife and mother has a right to a
home. The sumptuary law of the saloon says to hundreds of thousands of
such women: "You shall not have a home; you shall live in a hovel. You
shall not order your home, your food, your drink, your clothing,
according to your conscience, but according to the best interest of
the saloon these comforts shall be ordered. You shall work all day in
the harness of oppression and when night comes instead of restful
sleep, you shall watch the stars out and wait the return of husband
and sons." What about this inhuman denial of the right to order meat,
drink, clothing and home life? Such is the sumptuary law of the
saloon.

Every child in this country has a right to an education and a chance
in the world. The saloons say to hosts of children: "You shall have
neither education nor opportunity. You shall go to the streets and
sweat-shops to earn bread. You shall live in ignorance and mid evil
environment that we may gather in the wages of your fathers." How does
this sumptuary law of the saloon compare with a sumptuary law that
forbids the sale of what is of no earthly or eternal benefit to any
one who uses it.

The same distinguished editor said: "When women gather around voting
booths on election days with sandwiches and coffee, they present an
indecent spectacle to the public." The man who goes with gun in hand
and shoots down another in defense of his country is a hero. The
mother lion or bear that defies the hunter's bullets and dies in
defense of her young we can but respect; but when woman, who has
suffered so long in silence, goes near where the welfare of her home
is at stake and out of the sore, sad sorrow of her heart appeals to
men for protection to her home from the ravages of the saloon, she is
not paid the respect given to a mother hen or bird or bear by the
advocate of the liquor traffic. When the niece of Cardinal Richelieu
was demanded by a licentious king, the Cardinal said: "Around her form
I draw the awful circle of our kingly church; set a foot within and on
thy head, aye, though it wear a crown, shall fall the curse of Rome."
Shall the crown of gold on the distiller's and brewer's brow hush into
silence the lion-hearted manhood of our republic when its sons and
daughters are demanded to feed the maw of the liquor traffic?

One of the famous pictures of the masters is of a woman bound fast to
a pillar within the tide-mark of the ocean. The waves are curling
about her feet. A ship is passing under full sail but no one seems to
see or heed the woman in peril. Birds of prey hover above her, but she
sees neither bird, nor ship, nor sea; knowing her doom is sealed, she
lifts her eyes to heaven and prays. This picture represents thousands
of women tied fast to their doom within the tide-waves of the ocean of
intemperance. The ship of state passes by, bearing its share of the
ill-gotten gains of the liquor traffic, but heeds not the moans and
cries of struggling, strangling, dying woman. Oliver Cromwell said:
"It is relative misgovernment that lashes nations into fury." The long
suffering in silence by the womanhood of this country from the
misgovernment that has heaped upon woman the woes of strong drink by
the licensed saloon, whether a tribute to the patience of woman or
not, is to the eternal shame of man, whose inhumanity to woman through
the liquor traffic is making "countless millions mourn."

To this misgovernment is due the unrest among women and the impetus
behind the equal suffrage movement today. There needs to be a saving
influence brought into our political life, and I have faith to believe
that woman's ballot will provide that influence. Having proved her
dignity in every new field of activity she has entered, I believe the
same flowers of refinement will adorn the ballot box when she holds in
her hand the sacred trust of franchise. Her life-long habit of
house-cleaning will be carried to the dirty pool of politics, where
the saloon is entrenched, and the demagogue and demijohn will be
carted away to the garbage pile of discarded rubbish.

Now and then I am asked: "What will become of the men who are engaged
in the liquor business if the country goes dry? What will become of
their families?" I answer by asking: What becomes of the men the
saloons put out of business? What becomes of their families? When
prohibition puts a man out of business, it leaves him his brain,
blood, bone, muscle, nerves and whatever manhood he has left in store,
while his long rest from active toil has given him a reserve force for
active, useful business. When the saloon puts a man out of business,
he goes out with shattered nerves, weak will, poisoned blood and so
unfitted for service no place is open for him to earn a living.
Recently a man put out of business by prohibition said to me: "This
town went dry seven years ago, and going out of the saloon business
has been such a benefit to me and to my family, I shall work and vote
to put all other saloon-keepers in this state out of business for
their own good."

On the other hand, I have in mind a man who once chained the Congress
of the United States by his eloquence. Clients clamored for his
service, and prosperity crowned his practice in the courts. In
drinking saloons he lost his clientage and in penniless poverty he
died--unwept, unhonored, unsung. The ex-saloon-keeper to whom I
referred is city marshall and very popular, while the man put out of
business by the saloon has no chance:

  "Where he goes and how he fares,
  Nobody knows and nobody cares."

Along with the question of what will become of the men put out of
business by prohibition, comes the question, what will the farmers do
with their corn if distilleries are closed? Less consumption of
whiskey means more consumption of cornbread and that means more corn.
Less consumption of whiskey means greater consumption of bacon, and
more bacon means more corn to feed hogs. When a liquor advocate said
to an audience of farmers: "If this state goes dry what will you
farmers do with your corn," an old, level-headed farmer shouted:
"We'll raise more hogs and less hell."

Prohibition means more of everything good, and less of everything bad;
more manhood, less meanness; more gain, less groans; more bread, less
brawls; more clothing, less cussedness; less heartaches and more
happiness. Turn saloons into bake shops and butcher stalls,
distilleries into food factories, breweries into stock pens, and the
country will be a thousandfold better off than feeding its finances by
starving its morality.

This question lifts itself head and shoulders above every other
question touching practical politics today. You nowhere read of a
nation going to destruction because of too much gold or too little
silver, too much tariff or too little tariff, but always because of
the vices of its people. The nation that bases perpetuity upon moral
character will endure with the stars, while walls thick and high as
Babylon's will not save a drunken republic.

  "Vain mightiest fleets of iron found,
    Vain all her conquering guns,
  Unless Columbia keeps unstained
    The true hearts of her sons."

Beautiful Constance of France was dressing for a court ball. While
standing before a mirror, clasping a necklace of pearls, a spark from
the fireplace caught in the folds of her gown. Absorbed in her attire,
she did not detect the danger until a blaze started. Soon, rolling on
the floor in flames, she burned to death. When the news reached the
ballroom the music hushed, the dance halted, and "Poor Constance! Poor
Constance!" went from lip to lip, but soon the music started and the
dance went on. While I am talking now the youth, beauty and sweetness
of American life is in peril from the flames that are kindled by the
licensed saloon. From an inward fire men are being consumed and homes
destroyed. Will we say, "Poor Columbia!" and keep step to the
_mocker's_ march to the nation's death; or will we put out every
distillery and brewery fire and make this in reality "the land of the
free and the home of the brave?"

In the name of all that is pure and true and vital in national life, I
plead with every lover of home and country to come to the help of the
cause that must succeed if this republic is to live. I plead with
Christians in the name of the church, bleeding at every pore because
of the curse of drink. If everyone whose name is on a church roll
would step out in line of duty on this question, very soon God would
stretch out His arm and save this republic from the liquor traffic.
God has been ready a long time; His people have not been ready to do
their part. Too many Christians are like the horse Sam Jones used to
tell of.

He said: "We have a horse in my neighborhood in Georgia, which if
hitched to a load of stone or cotton balks and won't go a step; but in
light harness in the shafts of a race cart he will pace a mile in
two-thirty. We have too many Christians who are like this horse; they
trot out to church Sunday morning, but hitch them to a prayer meeting
and they won't pull a pound."

Dr. McLeod, the stalwart Scotch preacher, on his way to a session of
his church had with him a small hunch-back member of his church, a
dwarf in size but an earnest worker. Crossing a certain stream a storm
struck the boat and the waves were sending it toward the rocks. A
boatman at one end said:

"Let the big preacher pray for us."

The helmsman at the other end said: "No, let that little fellow pray
and the big one take an oar."

Oliver Cromwell, going through a cathedral, came upon twelve silver
statues. Turning to the guide he said: "Who are these?"

The guide replied: "Those are the twelve apostles, life-size and solid
silver."

Cromwell said: "What good are they doing as silver apostles? Melt them
down into money and let them be of some service to the country."

We have too many silver statue church members who need melting down
and sending out to help save our republic from the fate of other
nations that have perished through their vices. We need more men with
moral courage to voice and vote their convictions. When the slavery
question was agitating the country Henry Clay stood for a compromise
he believed would help to solve the question. Many of his friends in
the South censured him, and sent him letters calling him a traitor. He
arose in the Senate to speak, it is said, looking pale from the effect
of the censure he was then receiving day by day. Addressing the Senate
he said: "I suppose what I shall say in this address will cost me many
dear friends." A reporter said: "He hesitated as if choked with
emotion at the thought of losing his friends." Then with the majesty
of greatness and magnetism of manner he proceeded, saying: "I am
charged with being ambitious. If I had listened to the soft
whisperings of ambition I would have stood still, gazed upon the
raging storm and let the ship of state drift on with the winds. I seek
no office at the cost of courage or conviction. Pass this bill.
Restore affection to the states of this Union and I will go back to my
Ashland home; there in its groves, on its lawns, 'mid my flocks and
herds, and in the bosom of my family, I will find a sincerity I have
not found in the public walks of life. Yes, I am ambitious, but my
ambition is that I may become the humble instrument in the hands of
God, in restoring harmony to a distracted nation, and behold the
glorious spectacle of a true, united happy and prosperous people."

There is a grandeur in the mountain that lifts itself above the
hamlets at its base, and bearing its brow to the threatening storm
clouds says to the forked lightning, "Strike me!" but grander is the
man who can stand 'mid the allurements of the world's honors and say:
"I would rather be right than President." Dare to do right and what
you do will have its reward.

"Shamgar, what's that in thy hand?"

"Only an ox-goad."

"Come dedicate it to God, and go slay those Philistines."

"David, what's that in thy hand?"

"Only a sling and a little stone from the brook."

"Come dedicate them to God, and go kill the giant."

"My little lad, what's that you have?"

"Only five loaves and two little fishes."

"Come, dedicate them to God; they'll feed thousands and you will have
baskets full left."

My brother, what's that in thy hand? Only a little American ballot.
Come dedicate it to God and home and native land, go cast it against
the licensed liquor traffic and your life will bear fruit which the
angels will gather when you have "finished your course" and "kept the
faith."

You are soon to have the local option test in your county. If I could
do one thing I could make the victory for the home overwhelming. You
know if the saloons continue they will have their victims in the
future as they have had in the past. You know too their victims will
come from the youth of your county. Though of a polite and courtly
behavior, he died lamented by no party. His ingratitude to the king,
and his frequent changing of sides, were regarded as great stains on
his memory. The earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen, being condemned
by the same court, were pardoned by the commons.

The king left six children--three males: Charles, born in 1630; James,
duke of York, born in 1633; Henry, duke of Gloucester, born in 1641;--and
three females: Mary, princess of Orange, born 1631; Elizabeth, born
1635; and Henrietta, afterwards duchess of Orleans, born at Exeter,
1644.

The archbishops of Canterbury in this reign were Abbot and Laud; the
lord keepers, Williams bishop of Lincoln, Lord Coventry, Lord
Finch, Lord Littleton, and Sir Richard Lane; the high admirals, the
duke of Buckingham and the earl of Northumberland; the treasurers,
the earl of Marlborough, the earl of Portland, Juxon bishop of
London, and Lord Cottington; the secretaries of state, Lord Conway,
Sir Albertus Moreton, Coke, Sir Henry Vane, Lord Falkland, Lord
Digby, and Sir Edward Nicholas.

It may be expected that we should here mention the Icon Basiliké, a
work published in the king's name a few days after his execution.
It seems almost impossible, in the controverted parts of history,
to say any thing which will satisfy the zealots of both parties:
but with regard to the genuineness of that production, it is not
easy for an historian to fix any opinion which will be entirely to
his own satisfaction.

The proofs brought to evince that this work is or is not the king's,
are so convincing, that if an impartial reader peruse any one side
apart,[*] he will think it impossible that arguments could be produced,
sufficient to counterbalance so strong an evidence: and when he compares
both sides, he will be some time at a loss to fix any determination.

Should an absolute suspense of judgment be found difficult or disagreeable
in so interesting a question, I must confess, that I much incline
to give the preference to the arguments of the royalists. The testimonies
which prove that performance to be the king's, are more numerous,
certain, and direct, than those on the other side. This is the case,
even if we consider the external evidence: but when we weigh the
internal, derived from the style and composition, there is no manner
of comparison. These meditations resemble, in elegance, purity, neatness,
and simplicity, the genius of those performances which we know
with certainty to have flowed from the royal pen; but are so unlike
the bombast, perplexed, rhetorical, and corrupt style of Dr.

Gauden, to whom they are ascribed, that no human testimony seems
sufficient to convince us that he was the author. Yet all the evidences
which would rob the king of that honor, tend to prove that Dr. Gauden
had the merit of writing so fine a performance, and the infamy of
imposing it on the world for the king's.

* See, on the one hand, Toland's Amyntor, and on the other, Wagataffe's
Vindication of the Royal Martyr, with Young's Addition. We may
remark, that Lord Clarendon's total silence with regard to this
subject, in so full of history, composed in vindication of the
king's measures and character, forms a presumption on Toland's side,
and a presumption of which that author was ignorant; the works of
the noble historian not being then published.

Bishop Burnet's testimony, too, must be allowed of some weight
against the Icon.

It is not easy to conceive the general compassion excited towards
the king, by the publishing, at so critical a juncture, a work so
full of piety, meekness, and humanity.

Many have not scrupled to ascribe to that book the subsequent
restoration of the royal family.

Milton compares its effects to those which were wrought on the tumultuous
Romans by Anthony's reading to them the will of Cæsar.

The Icon passed through fifty editions in a twelvemonth; and, independent
of the great interest taken in it by the nation, as the supposed
production of their murdered sovereign, it must be acknowledged the
best prose composition which, at the time of its publication, was
to be found in the English language.

CHAPTER LX.

THE COMMONWEALTH.

CONTEMPORARY MONARCHS.

EMP of GERM. K. OF FRANCE. K. or SPAIN.

Ferdinand III 1658 Lewis XIII. Philip IV.

{1649.}

The confusions which overspread England after the murder of Charles
I., proceeded as well from the spirit of refinement and innovation
which agitated the ruling party, as from the dissolution of all
that authority, both civil and ecclesiastical, by which the nation
had ever been accustomed to be governed. Every man had framed the model
of a republic; and, however new it was, or fantastical, he was eager
in recommending it to his fellow-citizens, or even imposing it by
force upon them. Every man had adjusted a system of religion, which,
being derived from no traditional authority, was peculiar to himself;
and being founded on supposed inspiration, not on any principles of
human reason, had no means, besides cant and low rhetoric, by which
it could recommend itself to others.

The levellers insisted on an equal distribution of power and property,
and disclaimed all dependence and subordination. The Millenarians, or
Fifth Monarchy men, required, that government itself should be
abolished, and all human powers be laid in the dust, in order to
pave the way for the dominion of Christ, whose second coming they
suddenly expected.

The Antinomians even insisted, that the obligations of morality and
natural law were suspended, and that the elect, guided by an
internal principle more perfect and divine, were superior to the
beggarly elements of justice and humanity.

A considerable party declaimed against tithes and a hireling priesthood,
and were resolved that the magistrate should not support by power
or revenue any ecclesiastical establishment.

Another party inveighed against the law and its professors; and,
on pretence of rendering more simple the distribution of justice,
were desirous of abolishing the whole system of English jurisprudence,
which seemed interwoven with monarchical government.

Even those among the republicans who adopted not such extravagancies,
were so intoxicated with their saintly character, that they supposed
themselves possessed of peculiar privileges; and all professions,
oaths, laws, and engagements, had, in a great measure, lost their
influence over them.

The bands of society were every where loosened; and the irregular
passions of men were encouraged by speculative principles, still
more unsocial and irregular.

The royalists, consisting of the nobles and more considerable gentry,
being degraded from their authority and plundered of their property,
were inflamed with the highest resentment and indignation against those
ignoble adversaries who had reduced them to subjection. The
Presbyterians, whose credit had first supported the arms of the
parliament, were enraged to find that, by the treachery or superior
cunning of then associates, the fruits of all their successful labors
were ravished from them.

The former party, from inclination and principle, zealously attached
themselves to the son of their unfortunate monarch, whose memory
they respected, and whose tragical death they deplored. The latter
cast their eye towards the same object; but they had still many
prejudices to overcome, many fears and jealousies to be allayed,
ere they could cordially entertain thoughts of restoring the family
which they had so grievously offended, and whose principles they
regarded with such violent abhorrence.

The only solid support of the republican independent faction, which,
though it formed so small a part of the nation, had violently usurped
the government of the whole, was a numerous army of near fifty thousand
men.

But this army, formidable from its discipline and courage, as well as
its numbers, was actuated by a spirit that rendered it dangerous to
the assembly which had assumed the command over it.

Accustomed to indulge every chimera in politics, every frenzy in
religion, the soldiers knew little of the subordination of citizens,
and had only learned, from apparent necessity, some maxims of
military obedience.

And while they still maintained, that all those enormous violations of
law and equity, of which they had been guilty, were justified by
the success with which providence had blessed them; they were ready
to break out into any new disorder, wherever they had the prospect
of a like sanction and authority.

What alone gave some stability to all these unsettled humors was the
great influence, both civil and military, acquired by Oliver
Cromwell.

This man, suited to the age in which he lived, and to that alone, was
equally qualified to gain the affection and confidence of men, by
what was mean, vulgar, and ridiculous in his character, as to command
their obedience by what was great, daring, and enterprising.

Familiar even to buffoonery with the meanest sentinel, he never lost
his authority:
transported to a degree of madness with religious ecstasies, he
never forgot the political purposes to which they might serve.

Hating monarchy while a subject, despising liberty while a citizen,
though he retained for a time all orders of men under a seeming
obedience to the parliament, he was secretly paving the way, by
artifice and courage, to his own unlimited authority.

The parliament,--for so we must henceforth call a small and inconsiderable
part of the house of commons,--having murdered their sovereign with
so many appearing circumstances of solemnity and justice, and so much
real violence, and even fury, began to assume more the air of a
civil legal power, and to enlarge a little the narrow bottom upon which
they stood. They admitted a few of the excluded and absent members,
such as were liable to least exception; but on condition that these
members should sign an approbation of whatever had been done in their
absence with regard to the king's trial; and some of them were
willing to acquire a share of power on such terms: the greater part
disdained to lend their authority to such apparent usurpations.

They issued some writs for new elections, in places where they hoped
to have interest enough to bring in their own friends and dependents.
They named a council of state, thirty-eight in number, to whom all
addresses were made, who gave orders to all generals and admirals,
who executed the laws, and who digested all business before it was
introduced into parliament.[*] They pretended to employ themselves
entirely in adjusting the laws, forms, and plan of a new representative;
and as soon as they should have settled the nation, they professed
their intention of restoring the power to the people, from whom they
acknowledged they had entirely derived it.

* Their names were, the earls of Denbigh, Mulgrave, Pembroke, Salisbury,
Lords Grey and Fairfax, Lisle, Rolles, St. John, Wilde, Bradshaw,
Cromwell, Skippon, Pickering, Massam, Haselrig, Harrington, Vane, Jun.,
Danvers, Armine, Mildmay, Constable, Pennington, Wilson, Whitlocke,
Martin, Ludlow, Stapleton, Hevingham, Wallop, Hutchinson, Bond, Popham,
Valentine, Walton, Scott, Purefoy, Jones.

The commonwealth found every thing in England composed into a seeming
tranquillity by the terror of their arms. Foreign powers, occupied
in wars among themselves, had no leisure or inclination to interpose
in the domestic dissensions of this island.

The young king, poor and neglected, living sometimes in Holland,
sometimes in France, sometimes in Jersey, comforted himself amidst his
present distresses with the hopes of better fortune. The situation
alone of Scotland and Ireland gave any immediate inquietude to the
new republic.

After the successive defeats of Montrose and Hamilton, and the ruin
of their parties, the whole authority in Scotland fell into the
hands of Argyle and the rigid churchmen, that party which was most
averse to the interests of the royal family. Their enmity, however,
against the Independents, who had prevented the settlement of
Presbyterian discipline in England, carried them to embrace opposite
maxims in their political conduct. Though invited by the English
parliament to model their government into a republican form, they
resolved still to adhere to monarchy, which had ever prevailed in
their country, and which, by the express terms of their covenant
they had engaged to defend.

They considered, besides, that as the property of the kingdom
lay mostly in the hands of great families, it would be difficult to
establish a common wealth; or without some chief magistrate,
invested with royal authority, to preserve peace or justice in the
community. The execution, therefore, of the king, against which they
had always protested, having occasioned a vacancy of the throne,
they immediately proclaimed his son and successor, Charles II.; but
upon condition "of his good behavior, and strict observance of the
covenant, and his entertaining no other persons about him but such
as were godly men, and faithful to that obligation." These unusual
clauses, inserted in the very first acknowledgment of their prince,
sufficiently showed their intention of limiting extremely his
authority. And the English commonwealth, having no pretence to interpose
in the affairs of that kingdom, allowed the Scots, for the present,
to take their own measures in settling their government.

The dominion which England claimed over Ireland, demanded more
immediately their efforts for subduing that country. In order to convey
a just notion of Irish affairs, it will be necessary to look backwards
some years, and to relate briefly those transactions which had
passed during the memorable revolutions in England. When the late
king agreed to that cessation of arms with the Popish rebels,[*] which
was become so requisite, as well for the security of the Irish
Protestants as for promoting his interests in England, the parliament,
in order to blacken his conduct, reproached him with favoring that
odious rebellion, and exclaimed loudly against the terms of the
cessation.

They even went so far as to declare it entirely null and invalid,
because finished without their consent; and in this declaration the
Scots in Ulster, and the earl of Inchiquin, a nobleman of great
authority in Munster, professed to adhere. By their means the war
was still kept alive; but as the dangerous distractions in England
hindered the parliament from sending any considerable assistance to
their allies in Ireland, the marquis of Ormond, lord lieutenant,
being a native of Ireland, and a person endowed with great prudence
and virtue, formed a scheme for composing the disorders of his
country, and for engaging the rebel Irish to support the cause of
his royal master.

There were many circumstances which strongly invited the natives
of Ireland to embrace the king's party. The maxims of that prince
had always led him to give a reasonable indulgence to the Catholics
throughout all his dominions; and one principal ground of that enmity
which the Puritans professed against him, was this tacit toleration.
The parliament, on the contrary, even when unprovoked, had ever
menaced the Papists with the most rigid restraint, if not a total
extirpation; and immediately after the commencement of the Irish
rebellion, they put to sale all the estates of the rebels, and had
engaged the public faith for transferring them to the adventurers,
who had already advanced money upon that security.

The success, therefore, which the arms of the parliament met with at
Naseby, struck a just terror into the Irish; and engaged the
council of Kilkenny, composed of deputies from all the Catholic
counties and cities, to conclude a peace with the marquis of
Ormond.[**]
* 1643.

** 1646.

They professed to return to their duty and allegiance, engaged to furnish
ten thousand men for the support of the king's authority in England,
and were content with stipulating, in return, indemnity for their
rebellion, and toleration of their religion. Ormond, not doubting
but a peace, so advantageous and even necessary to the Irish, would be
strictly observed, advanced with a small body of troops to
Kilkenny, in order to concert measures for common defence with his new
allies.

The pope had sent over to Ireland a nuncio, Rinuccini, an Italian;
and this man, whose commission empowered him to direct the spiritual
concerns of the Irish, was emboldened, by their ignorance and
bigotry, to assume the chief authority in the civil government.
Foreseeing that a general submission to the lord lieutenant would
put an end to his own influence, he conspired with Owen O'Neal, who
commanded the native Irish, in Ulster, and who bore a great jealousy
to Preston, the general chiefly trusted by the council of Kilkenny.

By concert, these two malecontents secretly drew forces together,
and were ready to fall on Ormond, who remained in security, trusting
to the pacification so lately concluded with the rebels.

  He received intelligence of their treachery,
    made his retreat with celerity and
  conduct, and sheltered his small army
    in Dublin and the other fortified towns, which still remained in
the hands of the Protestants.

  The nuncio, full of arrogance, levity,
    and ambition, was not contented with
  this violation of treaty. He
    summoned an assembly of the clergy at Waterford, and engaged them
to declare against that pacification which the civil council had
concluded with their sovereign.

He even thundered out a sentence of excommunication against all who
should adhere to a peace so prejudicial, as he pretended, to the
Catholic religion; and the deluded Irish, terrified with his spiritual
menaces, ranged themselves every where on his side, and submitted
to his authority. Without scruple, he carried on war against the
lord lieutenant, and threatened with a siege the Protestant garrisons,
which were all of them very ill provided for defence.

Meanwhile, the unfortunate king was necessitated to take shelter in
the Scottish army; and being there reduced to close confinement,
and secluded from all commerce with his friends, despaired that
his authority, or even his liberty, would ever be restored to him.

He sent orders to Ormond, if he could not defend himself, rather to
submit to the English than to the Irish rebels; and accordingly the
lord lieutenant, being reduced to extremities, delivered up Dublin,
Tredah, Dundalk, and other garrisons, to Colonel Michael Jones, who
took possession of them in the name of the English parliament.
Ormond himself went over to England, was admitted into the king's
presence, received a grateful acknowledgment for his past services,
and during some time lived in tranquillity near London. But being
banished, with the other royalists, to a distance from that city, and
seeing every event turn out unfortunately for his royal master,
and threaten him with a catastrophe still more direful, he thought
proper to retire into France, where he joined the queen and the prince
of Wales.

  
    But by the music of her eloquence and the rhythm of
her rhetoric, she could send the truth echoing through the hearts of
her hearers like the strain of a sweet melody. Worth, of Paris,
France, would not have made an orator, but he could design a robe to
please a princess and make a dress to fit "to the queen's taste." Then
let Worths make dresses, and Frances E. Willards charm the world by
their eloquence.

Yonder is a boy. His soul is full of music; his fingers are as much at
home on the key-board of a piano as a mocking-bird in its own native
orange grove. His sister is a mathematician; she solves a problem in
mathematics as easily as her brother plays a piece of music. Because
one is a boy and the other a girl, don't make the girl teach music and
the boy mathematics. What God has joined together in fitness, let not
false education put asunder.

Recently I read of a man whose father left him a large business.
Though an exemplary man he could not make ends meet in a business out
of which his father had made a fortune. The man worried himself into
nervous prostration. While he remained at home for rest, his wife took
charge of the business and made of it a great success. I say let that
woman run the business and the man take care of his nerves.

I know a minister who is a good man, but his strength is in his limbs.
He's an athlete, but turn him loose in a field as full of ideas as a
clover field of blossoms, and he can't preach a good sermon. Let Dr.
Anna Shaw enter the same field and she will gather blossoms of thought
faster than you can store them away in your mind. Some one in my
presence may believe the man should keep on preaching and Anna Shaw go
to the sewing-room and run a sewing machine; but I say if the man's
strength is in his limbs, and Doctor Shaw's in her head, let the
preacher run the sewing machine and Doctor Shaw preach the gospel of
righteousness, temperance and judgment to come. If God fitted Anna
Shaw's brain and tongue for the platform, it would be unwomanly in her
to make herself the pedal power of a sewing machine. We want
successful, useful men and women; and in fields for which God has
fitted woman, don't be afraid to give her the freest, broadest
liberty, or be uneasy about her unsexing herself. She has entered two
hundred fields in the last one hundred years. Yes, I guess one more
field must be added, for I saw a woman a few years ago in an
occupation I had never seen one engaged in before. In a city where I
lectured a beautiful, intelligent young lady was running the elevator
of a hotel, and I was completely "taken up" by her.

Of all the new fields entered by woman you cannot point to one where
she has degraded her womanhood, or one that has not been blessed by
the touch of her influence.

It is true there are fanatics among women as there are among men, but
if the extreme woman goes too far, the average woman will call a halt
every time. Fifteen years ago I could stand on Michigan Avenue,
Chicago, in the evening and within a half hour count twenty young
women, dressed in bloomers, riding bicycles. Now one may go to
Chicago, spend a year and not see one. Woman is safe enough.

Some are uneasy lest woman will go beyond her sphere, but I am not so
much disturbed about the future of woman as I am of man. Upon virtue
and intelligence depends the future of this republic. Have men all the
virtue? Go to the saloons; are they frequented by women? No; _men_. Go
to the gambling halls; are they crowded with women? No; _men_. Go to
the jails and penitentiaries; are they full of women? No; _men_. Go to
the churches; are they crowded with men? No; mostly by women. What
about intelligence? Have men all the intelligence? Two girls graduate
from high schools to one boy. I am glad to be living now; one hundred
years hence, if I were to be born again, I would want to be a girl.
Woman goes to the door of death to give life to man and man should be
willing to let her seek out her own sphere for usefulness.

Not long since I read a book called "The New Woman." It was a novel by
an Englishman. In it the author takes a beautiful young girl, about
eighteen years of age, through a "Gretna-Green" experience with a
young man of twenty. She is the daughter of a widow; he, the only son
of a wealthy London merchant. They run away and after a month's search
are found by the father of the young man in southern France. The girl
is sent home to her mother; the young man sent to India in order to
get him far away from his wife. The novelist makes the young man a
noble character, who is determined to prove himself worthy of his
wife, and he toils to send her means for support. The young wife
becomes a mother, and the young husband toils the harder to care for
his wife and babe. When time hangs heavy on the hands of the young
mother, she is invited to join a woman's club. Here she imbibes the
spirit of the new woman. She soon neglects her child and appears
before the public for a lecture. She wears a low neck dress, paints
her cheeks, blondines her hair, smokes cigarettes and drinks wine. A
millionaire in India, who loses his own son, adopts the hero of the
novel, dies and leaves him the great estate. Then the young man
hurries back to his wife. He arrives in the evening, but finds she is
not at home; she is delivering a lecture in the opera-house. He awaits
her return; a storm rages outside; at a late hour she enters the door,
throws off her wraps and stands before her husband, with blondined
hair, painted cheeks, and eyes red with wine. He stares, then starts
toward her, when she brings him to a halt by her strange manner. He
asks, "Is not this my wife?" she answers, "No, I am the New Woman."
She refuses to let him see their child, drives him out into the storm,
then goes to her room, disrobes and lies down to dream of great
audiences and applause.

It is an insult to any intelligent reader. Where is the woman, who was
a sweet, modest young mother, and who today is a public speaker, who
has neglected her child, driven her husband without cause into the
street, blondines her hair, paints her cheeks, drinks wine and smokes
cigarettes? She would be hissed from the platform. The author simply
shows his extreme prejudice in an abstract attempt to prove that to be
a new woman means the surrender of all womanly graces.

Let me give you, not fiction but real history, that I may present to
you the kind of new woman I indorse. She was born in the State of New
York, was well educated, and at proper age married a young physician.
They moved to a western city, where for a while the young physician
did well; but in an evil hour he commenced to drink. Like many a noble
young man, he was too weak to resist the power of appetite, and soon
his practice left him. His wife, the mother of two boys, secured a
position in the public schools and by her ability, won her way to a
principalship. The husband wandered away, while the brave wife and
mother remained with her children, but followed her husband with
letters of loving appeal. After long separation he was taken seriously
ill in the far Southwest. She left children, home and school work to
go to his bedside. Her watchful care brought him back from the very
door of death, and her prayers were answered in seeing him forsake the
cup and hide for safety in the cleft of the Rock of Ages. He returned
with her to their home, but soon after passed away. She buried him
beneath the green Missouri sod, planted flowers about the grave, paid
him tribute of her tears, and returned to her work.

In the course of these years she had joined the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union and was recognized as one of its greatest leaders.

Several years ago I gave an address in Hot Springs, Ark. A card was
presented at my door, which bore the name of the heroine of my story.
Going to the parlor I said: "What are you doing here?"

"My boy has been very ill with rheumatism and I have been here with
him for several weeks. He is better now and I return to my work
tomorrow."

Months later she was called again to the bedside of this son, and with
all the tenderness of mother-love, he was cared for until he too
passed over the river. Again she took up her work on the platform,
where she inspired many young women to do their best in life, and
called many to righteousness. She was the salt of the earth, the
embodiment of nobility, the soul of truth; and not only her own state
but the whole country is better because she lived.

Ask the author of the novel for the _real_ to his story; he cannot
name her; she does not live in England or America. Ask me for mine and
I answer Clara C. Hoffman, for years the associate of Frances E.
Willard as national officer of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
and state president of the white ribboners of Missouri.

In a magazine article an author said: "Out of one hundred and
forty-five graduates of a certain female college, only fifteen have
married." A Chicago editor quoted the statement and asked: "Is it
possible education breeds in woman a distaste for matrimony and home
life?" In the first place, I would answer: "You never can know how
many are going to marry until they are all dead."

Another explanation is that the average school girl goes out of school
at that impulsive age when "love acts independent of all law, and is
subject to nothing but its own sweet will," no matter how many years
father has toiled to give her the comforts of life, nor how many
sleepless nights mother has spent to give her rest. She meets a young
man; he is handsome, dresses well and talks fluently. She falls in
love, and sees in "love at first sight," the "inspiration of all
wisdom." In a week, though she knows nothing of the young man's
character or disposition, she is ready to say to her parents: "I
appreciate all you have done for me: I love you devotedly, but I have
met such a nice fellow; he has asked me to marry him, and I have
accepted; ta-ta!" She's gone. If her parents ask about the prospect
for a living, she answers as did the young girl whose father said:
"Mary, are you determined to marry that young man?"

"I am, Father."

"Why, my child, he has no trade, no money, and very little education;
what are you going to do for a living?"

She replied: "Aunt is going to give me a hen for a wedding present.
You know, Father, it is said one hen will raise twenty chickens in a
season. The second season, twenty each, you see, will be four hundred;
the third season, eight thousand; the fourth season, one hundred and
sixty thousand; and the fifth season, only five years, twenty each
will be three million, two hundred thousand chickens. At twenty-five
cents each they will bring eight hundred thousand dollars. We will
then let you have money enough to pay off the mortgage on the farm and
we will move to the city."

To a girl in love, every hen egg will hatch; not a chicken will ever
die with the gapes; they will all live on love, like herself, and
everything will be profit.

The college girl cannot marry at this impulsive, air-castle age. She
must wait until she gets through college. By that time she is old
enough for her heart to consult her head, and her head inquires into
the character and capacity of the young man. Beside this, it has been
the custom for women to look up to man, and when the college woman
looks up, quite often she doesn't see anybody. Young man, if you want
the college girl you must "get up" in good qualities to where she will
see you without looking down.

I believe this higher education for women will tend to arrest the
recklessness by which life is linked with life at the marriage altar.
There is a legend among the Jews that man and woman were once one
being; an angel was sent down from Heaven to cleave them into two.
Ever since, each half has been running around looking for the other,
and the misfits have been many at the marriage altar.

These misfits remind me of an experience when I lectured for the
Colfax, Iowa, Chautauqua, some years ago. Frank Beard, the famous
chalk talker, was there and on Grand Army day he was on the program
for a short talk. I was seated by Mr. Beard while the speaker who
preceded him was telling war stories of his regiment and himself.
Frank Beard said to me: "Well! I guess I can exaggerate a little
myself." It was evident he intended to measure up to the occasion.
After getting his audience into proper spirit for the manufactured war
story, he said:

"I was in the war myself and had a few experiences. At the battle of
Shiloh, I was lying behind a log, when I saw about forty Confederates
come dashing down toward me. My first impulse was to rise, make a
charge and capture the whole forty. But I knew that would not be
strategy; generals did not manage a battle that way with such odds
against them, so I determined to make a detour. Perhaps some of you
young people do not know what a detour means. It means, when in such a
position as I was, to get up and go the other way. So I detoured. The
chaplain of our regiment detoured also; he could detour a little
faster than I, and was directly in front of me when a shell caught up
with me and took my leg off just above the knee. You may notice I walk
very lame." (Which he did just then for effect). "Well, the same shell
took off the chaplain's leg, and we tumbled into a heap. The surgeon
came up, and having a little too much booze, he got things mixed; he
put the chaplain's leg on me and my leg on the chaplain. We were in
good health, and the legs grew on all right. When I recovered, I
concluded to celebrate my restoration to usefulness, so I went into a
saloon and said to the bartender, 'Give me some good old brandy.' He
set out the bottle, and I began to fill the glass, when that
chaplain's leg began to kick. The chaplain was a very ardent
temperance man, and the first thing I knew, that temperance leg was
making for the door, and I followed. But what do you think? As I went
out, I met my leg bringing the chaplain in."

That's a very absurd story, a rather ridiculous one, but if the
surgeon had made the mistake Mr. Beard charged, he would not have made
any greater than is made every day at the marriage altar. Young women,
I would not silence the love songs in your hopeful hearts, but I would
have every betrothed girl demand of her lover not only a loving heart,
but a well rounded character and a reasonable store of useful
knowledge.

A writer on this question said: "This progress of woman lessens mother
love in our country." Is that true? Before the opening of a southern
exposition, a mother of four boys applied for and was engaged as chime
bell ringer. Perhaps some saw in the selection a woman as brazen as
the bells she would ring. On opening day she played, "He who watches
over Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps"; on New York day she played,
"Yankee Doodle" and "Hail Columbia;" on Pennsylvania day, "The Star
Spangled Banner;" on Kentucky day, "My Old Kentucky Home;" on Maryland
day, "Maryland, my Maryland;" on Georgia day, "The Girl I Left Behind
Me;" on colored people's day, the airs of the old plantation; on
newsboy's day, "The Bowery" and "Sunshine of Paradise Alley;" then
"Nearer, my God, to Thee," "Rock of Ages, Cleft For Me," soothed the
tired Christian heart. One afternoon she took two of her boys into the
belfry-tower; one seven, the other about three years of age. When they
tired of the confinement, the older boy said: "Mother, can we go out
for a walk?"

"Yes, son, but don't let go little brother's hand."

She was so absorbed by the music of her bells she did not notice the
passing of time until the night shadows began to gather. Then her
older boy came running up in the tower crying, "Mother, I've lost
little brother!"

She quit her bells and running through the grounds set every policeman
looking for her boy; then she hurried back to her bells and began to
play "Home, Sweet Home." It is said the bells never rang so clear and
sweet. Over and over again she played, "Home, Sweet Home;" some
wondered why the tune did not change. At last, while trembling with
dread and eyes filled with tears, she heard a sweet voice say, "Mama,
I hear de bells and I tome to you." The mother, turning from the
bells, clasped the child to her bosom and thanked God for its safety.

It is said everything is undergoing a constant change, but until the
chime bells ring in the eternal morning mother love will live on, the
same unchanging devotion. Several years ago I stood on Portland
Heights, Oregon, in the evening, and saw Mount Hood in its snow-capped
majesty, when the stars seemed to be set as jewels in its crown. If
you ask me by what force that giant was lifted from the level of the
sea till its dome touched the sky, I cannot answer you, but I know it
stands there, a towering sentinel to traveler on land and sailor on
the sea. So mother love, which no one can solve, exists as unchanging
as the love of God; broad enough and strong enough to meet all the
changing conditions of time.

While I did not make this lecture to include the suffrage question, I
cannot turn away from the new woman without a word about the ballot
for women. It is no longer a question of right, but whether or not men
will grant the right. This I believe men will do when the sentiment of
women is strong enough to force the issue. "Taxation without
representation" is no less a tyranny to women than to men. I was the
guest of a wealthy widow, who paid more taxes than any man in the
county, yet a foreigner, who had been in this country less than three
years, who had not a dollar of property nor a patriotic impulse, laid
down the hoe in the garden, and going to the polls, voted additional
tax upon the woman he worked for; and the saloon influence upon her
two boys, while she had no voice in what taxes her property, or what
might tax her heart by the ruin of a son. There being no question
about woman's right to the ballot, there should be no hesitation on
man's part in bestowing the right.

I now turn from the new woman to the old man. I do not mean the man
old in years; for him I have only words of honor and praise. I mean
the man set in old ways and habits that neutralizes the progress and
wastes the forces of the republic. At the door of this old man lie the
causes of commercial disturbances, depression in trade and recurring
panics more than in the causes stressed by partisans for political
effect.

We should never have hard times in this country. We live in the best
land beneath the sky. It has been well said: "This is God's last best
effort for man." We have soil rich enough to grass and grain the
world. Our vast domain is inlaid with gold, silver, iron and lead of
boundless worth. Deep in the bosom of Columbia are fountains of gas
and oil, sufficient to light and heat our homes for a century to come.
Within these healthful lines of latitude is room enough not only to
house all the peoples of the earth, but to sty all the pigs, stable
all the horses, and corral all the cattle of the world.

To have all these gifts crowned with sunshine and shower, free from
pestilence and famine, we are the most prosperous and should be the
best contented people on the earth. In such a land there should be
perpetual peace and plentiful prosperity. Yet we have hard times after
hard times, and panic after panic. Why is this? If I could tell you
why, it would repay for the time and money spent to hear this lecture.
During the great panic in the nineties Mr. W.C. Whitney of New York,
wrote a letter to a leading New York daily in which he said: "There
are just two causes for this panic; too much silver and too much
tariff." I do not disparage these two problems, but I do say Mr.
Whitney had a very narrow view of a panic. Like many another man, he
had a thorough knowledge of certain things and was totally ignorant of
others.

A Chief Justice of the United States was riding in a carriage with his
family when a shaft broke. It was not broken short off, but shivered
by contact with a post. The Chief Justice had no strings and was in a
dilemma. A negro boy passed by, dressed in rags, whistling a merry
tune. The great jurist hailed the boy, saying, "Boy, have you a
string?"

"No, boss, what's de matter?"

"I have broken the shaft of my carriage," said the Justice.

"Yas, sir, I guess you is, boss. Is you got a knife? If you is, I
think I can fix it for you."

Taking the knife, he jumped the fence and cut withes from a sapling,
with which he lashed a lath to the shaft.

"I guess da'll git you home, boss."

"That's a good job," said the Judge; "why didn't I think of that?"

The boy replied: "I don't know, sir, 'cept some folks know more than
others."

That boy did know more than the Chief Justice of the United States
about mending a broken shaft. I think I know a thing or two about
panics which Mr. Whitney did not seem to have learned. Let me give you
two causes for panics. They are not all but they rank with Mr.
Whitney's.

First, the extravagance of the people. When times are good and money
plentiful, people are extravagant. They buy everything and pay
enormous prices. A horse, Axtell, brings his owner one hundred and
five thousand dollars; a two-year-old colt, Arion, one hundred and
twenty-five thousand. A town site is located in a barren waste and
lots sell at ten to one hundred dollars a front foot. All kinds of
wildcat schemes are promoted, and the people bite at the bait. An era
of extravagance is on and "sight unseen" investments are made. Several
years ago my brother said to me: "Are you going West soon, as far as
Kansas City?" When I replied that I was he said: "I have never been in
that city but I have two lots there I wish you would look at and
ascertain their value." He advised me to call on a certain real estate
agent, who would show me the lots. When I called on the agent a little
while later, he informed me the lots could not be seen until a dry
spell took off the water. Two lots my brother never saw and never
sold; decidedly "watered stock."

A man with a thousand dollars buys a five thousand dollar lot. He
knows he can't pay for it, but there's a boom and he expects to sell
for six thousand before the second payment is due. He doesn't sell.
When he can't sell he goes to the bank to borrow money to make the
payment; he finds there many more in the same condition as himself.
The banks see the trouble coming and will not loan. When the banks
refuse to loan the depositors get scared and take their money out of
the bank. During that great panic in the nineties three hundred
millions of dollars were taken out of circulation within four months
by depositors who were scared. Then the country gets flat on its back
with a panic. A friend said to me, during the great depression: "Don't
you think it will be over soon?" I replied: "Let a man have typhoid
fever until reduced to a skeleton; let the doctor call some morning
toward the close of the long siege and say, 'The fever is broken, get
up and go to work.' Can the man obey the doctor? No; he must have
chicken-broth and gruel, and slowly regain his strength." So when a
panic comes we must creep out, and we were so deep in the nineties it
took a long time to recover.

When a panic comes however, the extravagance ceases; everybody gets
stingy. A man with five thousand dollars doesn't buy a five thousand
dollar lot. He doesn't buy anything; his wife must wear the old
bonnet, and his church assessment is reduced. Then the tide turns and
the country recovers from its extravagance. But when times get good,
crops are fine and money plentiful, the people begin again; women
spending their money for dry goods, men for wet goods; another era of
extravagance is on and another panic coming.

Mr. Whitney said: "Too much silver and too much tariff." All the gold
and all the silver money in this country would not pay the old man's
drink and tobacco bill for five years. We drink, smoke and chew up all
the money in this country, gold, silver, and paper, every seven years.
Last year we spent about six millions for missions; one hundred and
fifty millions for churches; two hundred and seventy-five millions for
schools; and eighteen hundred millions for intoxicating liquors and
tobacco. Awake, O Conscience! and pour out thy saving influence for
the healing of the nation.

We live in a marvelous country. What this republic has accomplished in
one hundred and thirty-eight years, is the wonder of the world. At the
close of the Revolutionary War those who survived were poor, wounded,
bleeding people, occupying only the eastern rim of a wilderness waste,
while wild beast and wilder Indians roamed the mighty expanse to the
western ocean. From the penniless poverty of then, has come the
wonderful wealth of now. Where the tangled wilderness choked the
earth, now fields of golden grain dot the plains, carpets of clover
cover the hillsides, cities hum with the music of commerce, while
rivers and railroads carry rich harvests to the harbors of every land.
Emerson wrote better than he knew when he wrote:

  "So I uncover the land, which of old time I hid in the west,
  As the sculptor uncovers his statue, when he has wrought his best."

Yet grand as this country has grown to be, "the eagle of liberty can
never reach the pinion heights its wings were made to measure," while
the shell of wasted resources to which I have referred bows low its
head. Money won't save us. Babylon had her gold standard; her images
were made of gold. Media, Persia, had her free silver standard; her
images were made of silver. Rome had her gold, her silver, brass and
iron; yet they were all dashed to pieces on the world's highway. "In
the hollow of the hand of God is the destiny of this republic," and we
cannot buy Him with money. The wealth that satisfies the ruler of
nations is character.

Some one said a few years ago, and it went the rounds of the press:
"The question during the Civil War was, shall we have two governments
or one; now the question is, shall we have any?" I quote to you with
as much confidence as any mortal ever proclaimed a truth: "This
republic will never fail or fall until God deserts it, and God will
not desert it until we desert Him."

  "Come the world in arms,
  We'll defeat, and then pursue;
  Nothing can our flag destroy,
  While to God and self we're true."

I am not one of those who believe our war with Spain was an accident.
For Dewey to cross that dead line at midnight; when morning dawned to
find mines of death behind him, an enemy's fleet of eleven ships
before him, these supported by shores belted with batteries; and yet
within six hours sink or disable every ship in the fleet, silence the
forts, lift the star spangled banner in triumph to wave, and not have
a warship sunk, nor a sailor killed, means more than the mere skill of
a Commodore. Some one may say we had a better navy. Spain didn't think
so. Before the war the Spanish papers said: "The United States is
bluffing. She can't go to war with us. She has only twenty-five
thousand soldiers, and they are kept out west to control cowboys and
Indians. Then the South is waiting for an opportunity to break out in
rebellion." Columbus discovered America in 1492; Spain didn't discover
the United States until 1898.

Do you ask what we are to do with the Philippine Islands? I cannot
tell you what is best, but I do know we didn't want them. The day
Dewey sailed from Hong Kong to Manila Bay, if Spain had said to the
United States: "Here are the Philippine Islands, we would like to make
you a present of them," the United States would have replied, "We
thank you, but decline the offer." Not one man in ten in this country
would have voted to take them. But the next day we had them, had
fought to get them; and I believe the same superhuman power that took
from Spain, the Netherlands, Flanders, Malacca, Ceylon, Java,
Portugal, Holland, San Domingo, Louisiana, Florida, Trinidad, Mexico,
Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chili, Argentina,
Uruguay, Paraguay, Patagonia, Guatemala, Honduras, San Salvador,
Nicaragua, Porto Rico, Cuba, and "then some," took away from Spain the
Philippine Islands and gave them to us, that the home, the church and
the school might be established in the Islands.

Perhaps some of you think I am getting off my subject. I am not; I am
talking now about the _old man_, Uncle Sam, and his mission in the
world.

It is the opinion of many that we are under no obligation to the
islands of the sea, but these conservative souls should not forget
that we are not only citizens of the United States, but of the globe
on which we dwell and of the universe of God. The world in which we
live, lives because of the light and heat it receives from other
worlds. If the rolling sun in the heavens is under obligation to
furnish light for our pathway, heat for our soil and warmth for our
blood, are we not under obligation to carry the light of civilization
to the people whose shores and ours are washed by the same waters? If
the full orbed moon is under obligation to pour its silver into our
nights, and lift the tides until our rivers are full, are not we under
obligation to lift the tide of hope in the heart of oppressed
humanity, and pour the light of intelligence into the night of
ignorance? Did God give us this grand country, with its boundless
resources, for us to draw our ocean skirts about our greatness and
pass by our bruised and bleeding neighbor, lying half dead on life's
Jericho road? If so, then call back our proud eagle of liberty from
its pinion flight through the skies of national achievement, and make
our national emblem the barnyard fowl that crows in the day dawn as if
creating light instead of noise, and then runs for his roost when the
shadows fall.

The Bible says we are fellow workers with God. What does this
fellowship imply? It means there are some things we can't do, which
God must do for us, and some things we can do He won't do for us. He
puts the coal in the earth; we must dig and blast it out. He puts oil
beneath the soil; we must bore into its wells and pump it out. He
gives us the earth and "the fullness thereof;" we must do the sowing
and reaping. He puts electricity in the air; we must bridle, saddle
and harness it. He empties the clouds into the basins of the earth and
gives us oceans, gulfs and lakes; but we must build boats to ride
them. He puts humanity on the earth and bids us love our neighbor as
ourselves.

Who is my neighbor? Some seem to think only those who live in our
immediate community. I read of a minister of a city church who called
upon one of his country members for a contribution for foreign
missionary work. The country brother said: "I don't believe in foreign
missions, and I must say, 'No'."

"Brother," the pastor said, "the Bible says you should love your
neighbor as yourself."

"I do love my neighbors."

"Who are your neighbors?"

"Those whose farms adjoin mine, and perhaps, those whose farms adjoin
theirs."

"How far do you own eastward?"

"To the third fence yonder."

"How far do you own toward the west?"

"About a half mile?"

"How deep do you own into the earth?"

"Well, I never thought of that, but about half-way, I guess."

"Well, my brother, I am asking you to help your neighbor China, who
joins your line below."

       *       *       *       *       *

I have a friend with plenty of this world's goods, and not a child.
When approached by the ladies of the Foreign Mission Society he said:
"I do not give to foreign missions; when you want anything for home
missions I'll help you." Perhaps he would; but many of that class are
represented by a colored man of whom I heard a Methodist bishop tell.
He said to a friend: "Dat wife of mine is got money on de brain; it's
money, money all the time. I can't go whar she is, but she's axing me
for money. She's jest sho'ly gwine to run me to the lunatic 'sylum ef
she don't quit her beggin' me for money."

The friend asked: "What does she do with so much money?"

The colored brother hesitated a minute, and said: "She don't do nuffin
wid it, caze I ain't never _give_ her none yet."

       *       *       *       *       *

My friend who opposes foreign missions said: "So much you give never
gets there." Yes; and so many seed the farmer puts into the ground
never grow, and so the farmer says,

  "Put five grains in every hill:
  One for the cut-worm, one for the crow,
  One to blight, and two to grow."

And you cannot tell which will grow. A weed grew by the wayside in the
old world. All it did was to furnish seed for the wind, and worry for
the farmer. But one blustering day, the wind carried a seed from the
wayside weed into a florist's garden; it sprouted, rooted and bloomed.
The gardener was impressed by the beautiful coloring of the blossom,
so he nurtured, transplanted and cultivated it into a beautiful
flower. It was from this bush, once a weed, Queen Victoria selected
the flower she carried when she entered the Crystal Palace to meet the
world's representatives.

When Delia Laughlin went astray, her father drove her from his door.
She was of that temperament that must either go to the heights or to
the depths, and to the depths she went. Down the rapids of a sinful
life her steps were swift. Along the Bowery she made her way to Five
Points, where thieves and drunkards dwelt. It was said she could drink
deeper, curse louder, and fight fiercer than any inmate of the most
wicked spot in New York City. Mrs. Whittemore went one day on her
mission of mercy through the slums. She sought some one to accompany
her who knew the deepest haunts of the wicked. Delia Laughlin was
recommended to her. Mrs. Whittemore, with her Bible in one hand and a
fragrant rose in the other, made her rounds. She was deeply impressed
with the intellect and culture, as well as the beauty of the wayward
girl who had been her guide through the slums. "Dear girl," she said;
"you are too bright and beautiful to be down here. I wish you would
come to see me at the Door of Hope Mission," and slipping a coin and
the white rose into the soiled fingers she said, "Good-bye."

The girl loved flowers, so she took the white rose to her room and put
it in water. Then with the coin she went to drown her misery in drink.
Forty-eight hours later she had slept off the debauch, and taking the
flower from the vase she said: "Ah! that represents my life. Once I
was as pure as the rose when the good woman gave it to me. Those
withered petals represent the withered graces of my life." From out
that little flower an arrow went to the heart of Delia Laughlin. She
took the street car and went to the Door of Hope Mission. Mrs.
Whittemore met her and they talked together. While the girl wept Mrs.
Whittemore prayed; she said: "O God, this poor girl has no other
friend than you. Her father's home is closed against her. You have
promised, when father and mother forsake, you will take the deserted
one. John, and told him that he had come with a purpose of doing what
grieved him to the very soul, and what he had earnestly with tears
besought the Lord not to impose upon him: but there was a necessity,
in order to the glory of God and good of the nation. He sat down for
some time, and heard the debate. He beckoned Harrison, and told him
that he now judged the parliament ripe for a dissolution. "Sir,"
said Harrison "the work is very great and dangerous: I desire you
seriously to consider, before you engage in it."

  "You say well," replied the general;
    and thereupon sat still about
  a quarter of an hour. When
    the question was ready to be put, he said again to Harrison, "This
is the time: I must do it."

  And suddenly starting up, he
    loaded the parliament
  with the vilest reproaches, for
    their tyranny, ambition, oppression, and robbery of the public.

  Then stamping with his foot, which was a
    signal for the soldiers to enter,
  "For shame," said he to the
    parliament, "get you gone: give place to honester men; to those
who will more faithfully discharge their trust.

You are no longer a parliament.

I tell you, you are no longer a parliament. The Lord has done with
you: he has chosen other instruments for carrying on his work." Sir
Harry Vane exclaiming against this proceeding, he cried with a loud
voice, "O! Sir Harry Vane, Sir Harry Vane! The Lord deliver
me from Sir Harry Vane!" Taking hold of Martin by the cloak, "Thou art
a whoremaster," said he; to another, "Thou art an adulterer;" to a
third, "Thou art a drunkard and a glutton;" "And thou an extortioner,"
to a fourth. He commanded a soldier to seize the mace. "What shall
we do with this bauble? Here, take it away. It is you," said
he, addressing himself to the house, "that have forced me upon
this. I have sought the Lord night and day, that he would rather slay
me than put me upon this work." Having commanded the soldiers to clear
the hall, he himself went out the last, and ordering the doors to
be locked, departed to his lodgings in Whitehall.

In this furious manner, which so well denotes his genuine character,
did Cromwell, without the least opposition, or even murmur,
annihilate that famous assembly, which had filled all Europe
with the renown of its actions, and with astonishment at its crimes,
and whose commencement was not more ardently desired by the people
than was its final dissolution.
All parties now reaped successively the melancholy pleasure of seeing
the injuries which they had suffered, revenged on their enemies, and
that too by the same arts which had been practised against them. The
king had, in some instances, stretched his prerogative beyond
its just bounds; and aided by the church, had well nigh put an end to
all the liberties and privileges of the nation. The Presbyterians
checked the progress of the court and clergy, and excited, by cant
and hypocrisy, the populace, first to tumults, then to war against
the king, the peers, and all the royalists.

No sooner had they reached the pinnacle of grandeur, than the Independents,
under the appearance of still greater sanctity, instigated the army
against them, and reduced them to subjection. The Independents, amidst
their empty dreams of liberty, or rather of dominion, were oppressed
by the rebellion of their own servants, and found themselves at once
exposed to the insults of power and hatred of the people. By
recent, as well as all ancient example, it was become evident, that
illegal violence, with whatever preferences it may be covered, and
whatever object it may pursue, must inevitably end at last in the
arbitrary and despotic government of a single person.

CHAPTER LXI.

[Illustration: 1-726-cromwell.jpg CROMWELL]

THE COMMONWEALTH.

{1653.} OLIVER CROMWELL, in whose hands the dissolution of the parliament
had left the whole power, civil and military, of three kingdoms, was
born at Huntingdon, the last year of the former century, of a good
family; though he himself, being the son of a second brother,
inherited but a small estate from his father.

In the course of his education, he had been sent to the university;
but his genius was found little fitted for the calm and elegant
occupations of learning; and he made small proficiency in his studies.
He even threw himself into a dissolute and disorderly course of life;
and he consumed, in gaming, drinking, debauchery, and country riots,
the more early years of his youth, and dissipated part of his
patrimony.

All of a sudden, the spirit of reformation seized him; he married,
affected a grave and composed behavior entered into all the zeal
and rigor of the Puritanical party, and offered to restore to every
one whatever sums he had formerly gained by gaming.

The same vehemence of temper which had transported him into the extremes
of pleasure, now distinguished his religious habits.

His house was the resort of all the zealous clergy of the party;
and his hospitality, as well as his liberalities to the silenced and
deprived ministers, proved as chargeable as his former debaucheries.
Though he had acquired a tolerable fortune by a maternal uncle,
he found his affairs so injured by his expenses, that he was obliged
to take a farm at St. Ives, and apply himself for some years to
agriculture as a profession. But this expedient served rather to
involve him in further debts and difficulties. The long prayers which
he said to his family in the morning, and again in the
afternoon, consumed his own time and that of his ploughmen; and
he reserved no leisure for the care of his temporal affairs.

His active mind, superior to the low occupations to which he was
condemned, preyed upon itself; and he indulged his imagination
in visions, illuminations, revelations; the great nourishment of
that hypochondriacal temper to which he was ever subject.
Urged by his wants and his piety, he had made a party with Hambden,
his near kinsman, who was pressed only by the latter motive, to transport
himself into New England, now become the retreat of the more zealous
among the Puritanical party; and it was an order of council which
obliged them to disembark and remain in England. The earl of
Bedford, who possessed a large estate in the fen country near the Isle
of Ely, having undertaken to drain these morasses, was obliged to apply
to the king; and by the powers of the prerogative, he got commissioners
appointed, who conducted that work, and divided the new-acquired
land among the several proprietors.

He met with opposition from many, among whom Cromwell distinguished
himself; and this was the first public opportunity which he had
met with, of discovering the factious zeal and obstinacy of his
character.

  From accident and intrigue he was chosen
  by the town of Cambridge member of the long parliament.

His domestic affairs were then in greater disorder; and he seemed not
to possess any talents which could qualify him to rise in that public
sphere into which he was now at last entered.
His person was ungraceful, his dress slovenly, his voice untonable,
his elocution homely, tedious, obscure, and embarrassed. The fervor
of his spirit frequently prompted him to rise in the house; but he was
not heard with attention: his name, for above two years, is not to be
found oftener than twice in any committee; and those committees into
which he was admitted, were chosen for affairs which would more
interest the zealots than the men of business.

In comparison of the eloquent speakers and fine gentlemen of the house,
he was entirely overlooked; and his friend Hambden alone was acquainted
with the depth of his genius, and foretold that, if a civil war should
ensue, he would soon rise to eminence and distinction.

Cromwell himself seems to have been conscious where his strength lay;
and partly from that motive, partly from the uncontrollable fury of his
zeal, he always joined that party which pushed every thing to
extremities against the king. He was active in promoting the famous
remonstrance, which was the signal for all the ensuing commotions; and
when, after a long debate, it was carried by a small majority, he
told Lord Falkland, that if the question had been lost, he was
resolved next day to have converted into ready money the remains
of his fortune, and immediately to have left the kingdom.

Nor was this resolution, he said, peculiar to himself: many
others of his party he knew to be equally determined.

He was no less than forty-three years of age when he first embraced the
military profession; and by force of genius, without any master, he
soon became an excellent officer; though perhaps he never reached the
fame of a consummate commander. He raised a troop of horse; fixed his
quarters in Cambridge; exerted great severity towards that university
which zealously adhered to the royal party; and showed himself a man
who would go all lengths in favor of that cause which he had espoused.
He would not allow his soldiers to perplex their heads with those
subtleties of fighting by the king's authority against his person,
and of obeying his majesty's commands signified by both houses of
parliament: he plainly told them, that if he met the king in battle,
he would fire a pistol in his face as readily as against any other
man.

His troop of horse he soon augmented to a regiment; and he first
instituted that discipline, and inspired that spirit, which rendered
the parliamentary armies in the end victorious. "Your troops," said he
to Hambden, according to his own account,[*] "are most of them old,
decayed serving men and tapsters, and such kind of fellows; the
king's forces are composed of gentlemen's younger sons and persons of
good quality. And do you think that the mean spirits of such base and
low fellows as ours will ever be able to encounter gentlemen,
that have honor, and courage, and resolution in them? You must
get men of spirit; and take it not ill that I say, of a spirit that
is likely to go as far as gentlemen will go, or else I am sure you will
still be beaten, as you have hitherto been, in every encounter."

* Conference held at Whitehall.

He did as he proposed. He enlisted the sons of freeholders and
farmers.
He carefully invited into his regiment all the zealous fanatics throughout
England. When they were collected in a body, their enthusiastic
spirit still rose to a higher pitch. Their colonel, from his own natural
character, as well as from policy, was sufficiently inclined to
increase the flame.

He preached, he prayed, he fought, he punished, he rewarded. The wild
enthusiasm, together with valor and discipline, still propagated itself;
and all men cast their eyes on so pious and so successful a leader.
From low commands, he rose with great rapidity to be really the first,
though in appearance only the second, in the army. By fraud and
violence, he soon rendered himself the first in the state. In
proportion to the increase of his authority, his talents always
seemed to expand themselves; and he displayed every day new abilities,
which had lain dormant till the very emergence by which they
were called forth into action.

All Europe stood astonished to see a nation, so turbulent and unruly,
who, for some doubtful encroachments on their privileges, had
dethroned and murdered an excellent prince, descended from a long line
of monarchs, now at last subdued and reduced to slavery by one who, a
few years before, was no better than a private gentleman, whose name
was not known in the nation, and who was little regarded even in that
low sphere to which he had always been confined.

The indignation entertained by the people against an authority
founded on such manifest usurpation, was not so violent as might
naturally be expected.

Congratulatory addresses, the first of the kind, were made to
Cromwell by the fleet, by the army, even by many of the chief
corporations and counties of England; but especially by the several
congregations of saints dispersed throughout the kingdom.[*]
* See Milton's State Papers.

The royalists, though they could not love the man who had imbrued his
hands in the blood of their sovereign, expected more lenity from
him than from the jealous and imperious republicans, who had hitherto
governed. The Presbyterians were pleased to see those men by
whom they had been outwitted and expelled, now in their turn expelled
and outwitted by their own servant; and they applauded him for
this last act of violence upon the parliament.

These two parties composed the bulk of the nation, and kept the people
in some tolerable temper. All men, likewise, harassed with wars and
factions, were glad to see any prospect of settlement. And they
deemed it less ignominious to submit to a person of such admirable
talents and capacity, than to a few ignoble, enthusiastic hypocrites,
who, under the name of a republic, had reduced them to a cruel
subjection.

The republicans, being dethroned by Cromwell, were the party whose
resentment he had the greatest reason to apprehend. That party,
besides the Independents, contained two sets of men who are seemingly
of the most opposite principles, but who were then united by a
similitude of genius and of character. The first and most numerous
were the Millenarians, or Fifth Monarchy men, who insisted that, dominion
being founded in grace, all distinction in magistracy must be
abolished, except what arose from piety and holiness; who expected
suddenly the second coming of Christ upon earth; and who pretended,
that the saints in the mean while, that is, themselves, were alone
entitled to govern.

The second were the Deists, who had no other object than political
liberty, who denied entirely the truth of revelation, and insinuated,
that all the various sects, so heated against each other, were alike
founded in folly and in error.

Men of such daring geniuses were not contented with the ancient and
legal forms of civil government; but challenged a degree of freedom
beyond what they expected ever to enjoy under any monarchy. Martin,
Challoner, Harrington, Sidney, Wildman, Nevil, were esteemed the heads
of this small division.

The Deists were perfectly hated by Cromwell, because he had no hold of
enthusiasm by which he could govern or overreach them; he therefore
treated them with great rigor and disdain, and usually denominated
them the heathens. As the Millenarians had a great interest in the
army, it was much more important for him to gain their confidence;
and their size of understanding afforded him great facility in deceiving
them. Of late years, it had been so usual a topic of conversation to
discourse of parliaments, and councils, and senates, and the soldiers
themselves had been so much accustomed to enter into that spirit,
that Cromwell thought it requisite to establish something which might
bear the face of a commonwealth. He supposed that God, in his
providence, had thrown the whole right, as well as power, of
government into his hands; and without any more ceremony, by the advice
of his council of officers, he sent summons to a hundred and
twenty-eight persons of different towns and counties of England,
to five of Scotland, to six of Ireland.

He pretended by his sole act and deed, to devolve upon these the whole
authority of the state. This legislative power they were to exercise
during fifteen months; and they were afterwards to choose the same
number of persons, who might succeed them in that high and important
office.

There were great numbers at that time who made it a principle always to
adhere to any power which was uppermost, and to support the
established government.

This maxim is not peculiar to the people of that age; but what
may be esteemed peculiar to them is, that there prevailed a hypocritical
phrase for expressing so prudential a conduct: it was called a waiting
upon providence. When providence, therefore, was so kind as to bestow
on these men, now assembled together, the supreme authority, they
must have been very ungrateful, if, in their turn, they had been
wanting in complaisance towards it. They immediately voted
themselves a parliament; and having their own consent, as well as
that of Oliver Cromwell, for their legislative authority, they
now proceeded very gravely to the exercise of it.

In this notable assembly were some persons of the rank of gentlemen;
but the far greater part were low mechanics; Fifth Monarchy men,
Anabaptists, Antinomians, Independents; the very dregs of the
fanatics.
They began with seeking God by prayer: this office was performed by
eight or ten gifted men of the assembly; and with so much success,
that, according to the confession of all, they had never before, in
any of their devotional exercises, enjoyed so much of the Holy
Spirit as was then communicated to them.[*] Their hearts were, no
doubt, dilated when they considered the high dignity to which they
supposed themselves exalted.

They had been told by Cromwell, in his first discourse, that he never
looked to see such a day, when Christ should be so owned.[**]
* Parl. Hist. vol. xx. p. 182.

* These are his expressions: "Indeed, I have but one word more to say
to you, though in that perhaps I shall show my weakness: it is by way
of encouragement to you in this work; give me leave to begin thus:
I confess I never looked to have seen such a day as this,--it may
be nor you neither,-- when Jesus Christ should be so owned as he
is at this day and in this work.

Jesus Christ is owned this day by your call, and you own him by
your willingness to appear for him, and you manifest this (as far as
poor creatures can do) to be a day of the power of Christ. I know
you will remember that scripture, 'he makes his people willing in
the day of his power.' God manifests it to be the day of the power
of Christ, having through so much blood and so much trial as has
been upon this nation, he makes this one of the greatest mercies, next
to his own Son, to have his people called to the supreme
authority. God hath owned his Son, and hath owned you, and hath made
you to own him. I confess I never looked to have seen such a day: I
did not." I suppose at this passage he cried; for he was very much given
to weeping, and could at any time shed abundance of tears. The rest
of the speech may be seen among Milton's State Papers, p. 106.
It is very curious, and full of the same obscurity, confusion,
embarrassment, and absurdity, which appear in almost all Oliver's
productions.

They thought it, therefore, their duty to proceed to a thorough
reformation, and to pave the way for the reign of the Redeemer, and
for that great work which, it was expected, the Lord was to bring
forth among them.

All fanatics, being consecrated by their own fond imaginations,
naturally hear an antipathy to the ecclesiastics, who claim a
peculiar sanctity, derived merely from their office and priestly
character. This parliament took into consideration the abolition of
the clerical function, as savoring of Popery; and the taking away
of tithes, which they called a relic of Judaism. Learning also and
the universities were deemed heathenish and unnecessary: the
common law was denominated a badge of the conquest and of Norman slavery;
and they threatened the lawyers with a total abrogation of their
profession.

Some steps were even taken towards an abolition of the chancery,[*]
the highest court of judicature in the kingdom; and the Mosaical law
was intended to be established as the sole system of English
jurisprudence.[**]
Of all the extraordinary schemes adopted by these legislators, they
had not leisure to finish any, except that which established the
legal solemnization of marriage by the civil magistrate alone,
without the interposition of the clergy.

They found themselves exposed to the derision of the public. Among the
fanatics of the house, there was an active member much noted for his
long prayers, sermons, and harangues.
He was a leather-seller in London, his name Praise-God Barebone.
This ridiculous name, which seems to have been chosen by some poet or
allegorist to suit so ridiculous a personage struck the fancy of
the people; and they commonly affixed to this assembly the appellation
of Barebone's parliament.[***] 
* Whitlocke, p. 543, 548

.

* Conference held at Whitehall.

* It was usual for the pretended saints at that time to change their
names from Henry, Edward, Anthony, William, which they regarded as
heathenish, into others more sanctified and godly: even the New Testament
names, James, Andrew, John, Peter, were not held in such regard
as those which were borrowed from the Old Testament, Hezekiah
Habakkuk, Joshua, Zerobabel.

Sometimes a whole godly sentence was adopted as a name.
Seeing the great
tree he said: "That's a good one to mark," and taking his axe in hand,
he sent the blade deep into the oak. Time passed with seemingly no
effect from the stroke given by the axeman. But steadily the sun smote
the wound, rain soaked into the scar, worms burrowed in the bark
around it, birds pecked into the decayed wood and finally foxes made
their home in the hollow trunk, and the day came when resisting force
had weakened, boasted strength had departed and the giant monarch of
the Sierras stood at the mercy of the winds that have no respect for
weakness.

There are young men before me today, who can drink or let it alone.
Temptation to them is no more than the gentle breeze in the branches
of the oak in the zenith of its strength. True, temptation has been
along their way blazing, here a glass of wine, there a glass of beer
and yonder a glass of whiskey. They can quit when they please, but the
less they please the more they drink, the more they drink the less
they please. They don't quit because they _can_, if they couldn't quit
they would, because they can, they won't. Thus they reason, while
appetite eats its way into their wills, birds of ill omen peck into
their characters and finally they will go down to drunkards' graves,
as thousands before them have gone. Young men, in the morning of life,
while the dew of youth is yet upon your brow, I beg you to bind the
pledge of total-abstinence as a garland about your character and pray
God to keep you away from the tempter's path.

I wonder that young men will trifle with this great "deceiver." I
wonder too at so much ignorance on the question among intelligent
people. Some years ago after a temperance address a gentleman was
introduced to me as the finest scholar in the city. Next morning we
were on the same train, and referring to the lecture of the evening
before, he said: "I heard your address and was pleased with your
kindly spirit, but I beg to differ with you, believing as I do, that
when properly used, alcoholic liquor as a beverage is good for health
and strength." I felt disappointed to hear a great scholar make such a
statement, but I ventured the reply:

"If that is true God made a mistake, since He made the whole phenomena
of animal life to run by water power. He made it in such abundance it
takes oceans to hold it, rivers and rivulets to carry it to man, bird
and beast, while in all the wide world He never made a spring of
alcohol. If it's good for strength, why not give it to the ox, the
mule and the horse?" It takes a good deal of faith to trust a sober
mule; I'm sure I wouldn't want to trust a drunken one. There is not a
man in my presence who would buy a moderate drinking horse, and no one
would wilfully go through a lot where a drunken dog had right of way.
Yet we license saloons to turn drunken men loose in the street, some
of them as vicious as mad dogs.

Good for strength? When Samson had slain the regiment of Philistines
and was exhausted and athirst; when in his extremity he cried to the
Lord: "Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
servant, and now shall I die from thirst." What was done to revive him
and renew his strength? Was strong drink recommended as a stimulant?
The Bible account informs us God "clave an hollow place in the jaw,
and water came thereout." Don't you think if alcoholic liquor had been
intended as a beverage for mankind, the great Creator would have made
a few springs of it somewhere? Bore into the earth you can strike oil,
but you can't strike whiskey. You can find sparkling springs of water
almost everywhere, but nowhere a beer brewery in nature. It's water,
blessed water all the time. On your right it bubbles in the brook; on
your left it leaps and laughs in the cascade; above you it rides in
rain clouds upon the wings of the wind; beneath you it hangs in
diamond dew upon the bending blade; behind you it comes galloping down
the gorge "from out the mountain's broken heart;" before you it goes
gliding down the glen, kissing wayside flowers into fragrance and
singing, as rippling o'er the rocks it runs: "Men may come and men may
go, but I go on forever." Oh, bright beautiful water! may it soon be
the beverage of all mankind.

I know some say: "This is a free country; if a man wants to drink and
be a brute, let him do so." The trouble about that is, while strong
drink will degrade some men to the level of the brute, drunkards are
not made of brutes. Some thirty or more years ago a grandson of one of
the greatest statesman this country ever produced, was shot in a
saloon while intoxicated. While that young man was dying, but a few
blocks away a grandson of one of the greatest men that ever honored
Kentucky in the Senate of the United States, was in jail to be tried
for murder committed while drunk; and in the same city at the same
hour in the station-house from drink was a great grandson of the
author of "Give me liberty or give me death." Whom did Daniel Webster
leave his seat in the Senate that he might hear his eloquence? S.S.
Prentice went down under the cloud of drink. A gifted family gave to a
Southern State a gifted son. His state sent him to the halls of
national legislation, but drink wrought his ruin. Horace Greeley was
his friend, and finding him drunk in a Washington hotel said to him:
"Why don't you give up what you know is bringing shame upon you and
sorrow to your family?"

He replied: "Mr. Greeley, ask me to take my knife and sever my arm
from my shoulder and I can do it, but ask me to give up an appetite
that has come down upon me for generations, I _can't_ do it." He threw
his cane upon the floor to emphasize his utterance. A few days later
in the old Saint Charles Hotel, he pierced his brain with a bullet and
was sent home to his family in his coffin.

Bring me the men who are drunkards in this city, strip them of their
appetite for strong drink, and they are husbands, brothers, fathers,
sons, and as a rule, generous in disposition.

Thank God, while drunkenness will drag down the gifted and noble,
temperance will build up the humblest and lowest. Bring me the poorest
boy in this audience, let him pledge me he will never take a drink of
intoxicating liquor as a beverage, let him keep that pledge, be
industrious and honest; my word for it, in twenty years from now he
will walk the streets of the city in which he dwells, honored,
respected, loved, and the world can't keep him down. I rejoice we live
in a land where I can encourage a boy, a land where rank belongs to
the boy who earns it, whether he hails from the mansion of a
millionaire or the "old log cabin in the lane;" a land where a boy can
go from a rail cut, a tan yard, or a toe-path, to the presidency of
the United States; a land where I can look the humblest boy in the
face and say:

  "Never ye mind the crowd, my boy, or think that life won't tell;
  The work is the work for aye that, to him that doeth it well.
  Fancy the world a hill, my boy; look where the millions stop;
  You'll find the crowd at the base, my boy; there's always room at
  the top."

Have you a trade? Go learn one. Do you know how to do things? Go try;
you may make mistakes, but do the best you can like the boy who joined
the church. At his uncle's table soon after he was asked to say grace.
He didn't know what kind of a blessing to ask, but he did know he was
very hungry, so bowing his head he said: "Lord, have mercy on these
victuals." I have faith in the boy who will try to do a thing. I
believe in a boy like that one in a mission Sabbath school in New
York, who though he had but little knowledge of the Bible, had a way
of reasoning about Bible lessons. The teacher of his class said to
him: "James, who was the strongest man of whom we have any account?"

He quickly replied: "Jonah."

"How do you make that out?" said the teacher.

Promptly the answer came: "The whale couldn't hold him after he got
him down."

Boys, are you poor? Columbus was a weaver; Arkright was a barber;
Esop, a slave; Bloomfield, a shoemaker; Lincoln, a rail-splitter;
Garfield tramped a toe-path with no company but an honest mule; and
Franklin, whose name will never die while lightning blazes through the
clouds, went from the humble position of a printer's devil to that
height where he looked down upon other men. If you would win in the
battle of life, take the right side of life and build a righteous
character. The saddest scene on the streets at night is the young man,
whose clothes are finest in quality and fittest in fashion, but whose
principles sadly need "patching." I dare say there are young men
before me now who would not go into refined company indecently dressed
for any consideration, but who will rush into the presence of their
God before they sleep with a dozen oaths upon their lips. Will
Carleton puts it this way:

  "Boys flying kites, haul in their white plumed birds;
  You can't do that when flying words;
  Thoughts unexpressed, may sometimes fall back dead,
  But God Himself can't kill them when they're said."

Will Carleton puts it in poetry, let's have it in prose. Boys, pay
more attention to your manners than to your moustache; keep your
conduct as neat as your neck-tie, polish your language as well as your
boots; remember, moustache grows grey, clothes get seedy, and boots
wear out, but honor, virtue and integrity will be as bright and fresh
when you totter with old age as when your mother first looked love
into your eyes.

Little Lucy Rome was taken up for vagrancy in a great city. When
brought before the court an austere judge said: "Who claims this
child?"

A boy arose and walking down near the Judge, said: "Please, sir; I do.
She's my sister; we are orphans, but I can take care of her if you'll
let her go."

"Who are you?" asked the Judge.

"I'm Jimmy Rome, and I have been taking care of my sister; but two
weeks ago the man for whom I worked died and while I was out looking
for another place, Lucy begged some bread and they took her up. But
now I've a good place to work, Judge, and I'm going to put little
sister in school. Please let me have her, sir."

The Judge said: "Stand aside. Officer, take the child to the
children's home."

The boy with tears streaming down his cheeks, as he heard his sister
sobbing, said: "Judge, please don't take her from me."

The Judge, moved by the pleading of the brother, said: "Well, my boy,
if you can find some reliable person to go your security you may have
her."

"Judge, I don't know anyone to give you; my good friend is dead, but I
told you the truth. I don't drink, nor smoke nor swear oaths; I try to
be a good boy; I work hard, but I can't give you any security. Judge,
will you please let me kiss my little sister before you take her from
me?"

With this the boy put his arms about his weeping sister and printed,
as he thought, the last kiss upon her cheek. The Judge, with a lump in
his throat, said: "Take her, my boy; I'll go your security. I'll give
Lucy to the care of such a brother."

Hand in hand the homeless orphan pair walked out of the court room
together, Jimmy Rome to make his mark in the business world and his
sister to be the wife of a merchant prince.

Boys, be industrious, be honest, be sober. "I will" fluttered from the
worm-eaten ships of Columbus; "I will" blazed upon the banners of
Washington and Grant; "I will" stamped the walls of Hudson river
tunnel, and dug the canal of Panama. Young man, write "I will" upon
your brow, give your heart to God and hope will herald your way to
victory as the reward of a well spent life. Keep your eye upon the
star of ambition. Don't be like the owl, who when daylight comes hides
himself within the shadows of the ivy-bound oak and moans and moans
the days of his life away; but rather be like the proud eagle that
leaves its craggy summit, starts on its pinion flight through the
clouds, rides upon the face of the storm, then on beyond bathes its
plumage in the "sunlight of the day god, and laughs in the face of the
coming morrow."

Some one said, and trifled with the secret of success and happiness
when he said it: "There's only a dollar's difference between the man
who works and the man who pays, and the man who pays, gets that."
There is an old superstition that somewhere on the earth, under the
earth or in the sea, there is a stone called the "philosopher's stone"
and whoever finds it will be "chiefest among ten thousand." The same
superstition prevails with many today; only the name of the stone is
turned to "luck," and thousands of young men are waiting for luck to
come along and turn up something for them. There is a rule of life,
young men, more reliable than luck. It is called an ancient law and
runs thus: "By the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." It is the
foundation of more sweet bread and pure enjoyment than all your luck.
On it the feet of Abraham Lincoln rested, while he wedged his way to
the highest office in the gift of the American people. On it
Shakespeare stood, driving a shuttle through the warp and woof of a
weaver's loom and wove out for himself a name and fame immortal. On it
Elihu Burrett wielded a sledge hammer, while developing a mind that
mastered many different languages. On it Henry Clay made his way from
the mill-sloshes of Virginia to the United States Senate, and on it
James A. Garfield tramped his toe-pathway from driving a mule, to
presiding over the destinies of seventy-five millions of people.

Boys, don't be idle. I know a man to-day who always looks so lazy it
really rests me to look at him. A boy working for a farmer was asked
by his employer if he ever saw a snail. The boy answered that he had.
"You must have met it, for you surely did not overtake it," said the
farmer. I know an old man who seems to take pride in saying he never
worked. The first time I saw this man was in my youth. While his
father was husking corn in a field, he was seated by a fire reading a
novel. Often after that, when I would go to the postoffice in the
winter, he would be there by the fire. He moved to the city thirty
years ago, where he spends his winters sitting around a fire. He
doesn't drink or gamble. I don't think he will have many sins of
commission for which to answer; he never commits anything; he sits by
the fire. When he dies an appropriate epitaph for his tomb will be:

  "He was never much on stirrin' round,
    Sich wasn't his desire;
  When weather cool, he was always found,
    A sittin' round the fire.

  "When the frost was comin' down,
    And the wind a creepin' higher,
  He spent his time just that way,
    A sittin' round the fire.

  "Same old habit every day,
    He never seemed to tire;
  While others worked and got their pay,
    He sat there by the fire.

  "When he died, by slow degrees,
    Some said, 'he's gone up higher;'
  But if he's doin' what he did,
    He's sittin' round the fire."

The man or woman who lives in this age of the world and lives in
idleness, should have lived in some other age. When ox-teams crept
across the plains, and stage coaches went six miles an hour, idleness
may have been in some kind of harmony with the age, but now, when
horses pace a mile in two minutes, express trains make fifty miles an
hour, and aeroplanes fly a mile in a minute; when telephone and
telegraph send news faster than light flies, the idler is out of
place. Carlisle said: "The race of life has become intense; the
runners are tramping on each other's heels; woe to the man who stops
to tie his shoestrings!"

Young man, if you would keep step with the energy of the age in which
you are living, and be ever found on the safe side of life, you must
not only be equipped with education, stability and ambition, but to
make sure you should start right. If you are going to California
tomorrow, which way would you start, east or west? You say: "We would
start west." A man riding along a highway said to a farmer by the
wayside: "How far to Baltimore?"

The farmer answered: "About twenty-five thousand miles the way you're
going; if you'll face about and go the other way, it's fourteen
miles."

Young man, which way are you going?

Does someone in my presence say: "I have started wrong; I take a glass
of beer now and then; occasionally utter an oath, and am sowing wild
oats in a few other fields; but I'll come out right in the end." Two
diverging roads keep on widening; they don't come together at the
other ends. If you would make sure of the safe side of life in the end
of the journey, then start right. Luke Howard graduated from a fine
college and went to a large city to practice his profession. He
boarded in a fine hotel and frequented fine saloons. He became
dissipated and one morning after a drunken debauch the landlord said:
"Sir, you disturbed my boarders last night and I must ask you to
leave." Young men, did Luke Howard go to a better hotel? No, but to a
grade lower; he started wrong. In this hotel a few months later, he
was asked to move on. Did he go to a better? No, still lower, until at
last he went to board in the low tavern on the river front. The
landlord said: "I remember when you graduated from college. I was
present, saw the flowers and heard the applause that greeted your
success. I feel honored to have you as a boarder." A few months later,
on Christmas night, Luke Howard lay drunk on the bar-room floor. The
landlord had borne all he could and, with a kick, he said: "Get up and
get out, you brute; I will not keep you another hour." The drunkard
with help arose and said: "Where am I? Why, this is my boarding place,
my home, and you are my landlord. You said you felt honored to have me
board here. What's the matter?"

"Luke Howard, you're not the man you once were, and I want you to
leave here at once."

The poor fellow started for the door muttering: "I am not the man I
was. I'm not the man I was." Missing the step as he went out, he fell,
striking his head against the stone curbing. A physician was summoned
and recognizing the injured man as an old friend said: "Luke, speak to
your old college chum; I'm here to help you."

The poor drunkard, looking through the blood that flowed from the
gaping wound said: "Listen to me, Tom, I'm not the man I was, I'm not
the man I was." And thus died the poor fellow.

Young man, start wrong and end right? No, start wrong and you may
expect in the autumn of life a penniless, friendless old age;
opportunity gone, health shattered, and the "long fingers of memory"
reaching out and dragging into its chambers thoughts that will "bite
like a serpent and sting like an adder." Bad as this is, it is even
worse when your depravity involves another life. What if that other
life is your mother, who went to the door of death to give you life,
and whose every breath is another thread of sorrow woven into her
wasting heart while her boy is bound like Mazeppa to the wild steed of
passion.

There are some things I cannot understand about this drink question. I
can understand how a young woman with jeweled fingers can tempt a
young man to drink wine. I had a bit of experience some years ago down
in Texas, that helped me to appreciate how young men are tempted. I
gave an address in a Y.M.C.A. lecture course in a city, and at the
close of my address a prominent citizen said to me: "Kentucky has a
reputation for beautiful women, but we think Texas has the handsomest
women in the world. At the hotel where you are stopping, there is a
leap year ball tonight and the most beautiful women for a hundred
miles around are gathered there. I will call for you at your room in a
little while and you must take a look at our Texas girls." A little
later I stood in a hallway where I could see down the long ball room,
and I declare they were as pretty women as I have ever seen, and I
live in Kentucky. I was invited to step inside the door, where between
dances I was introduced to couple after couple. It being leap year the
ladies were soliciting their partners for the dance, and a very
handsome young lady invited me to be her partner. Having never danced
and being a Methodist steward, I declined. Another and another asked
me to dance, and again and again I declined, giving as an excuse my
utter ignorance of the function. Finally a very beautiful, blue-eyed,
charming young lady said: "Since you do not dance, may I engage you
for a promenade around the ball room?" Boys, if I had been a young man
the chances are I would have started down the "turkey-trot" road that
evening. I can appreciate how young men are tempted.

There is one thing, however, about the drink habit that is difficult
for me to understand, and that is how a young man, who loves his
mother, whose mother loves him as only a mother can love, loved him
first, loved him best and will love him to the last, can go from home
and mother to the impure, degrading vileness of a liquor saloon. If we
enter that young man's home what do we find? Perhaps on one of the
side-walls, "What is home without a mother," on the altar the family
Bible, every picture on the walls suggestive of home life and purity,
every chair and piece of bric-a-brac linked with the sweet association
of childhood, the conversation as pure as the sunlight on which the
young man lives; yet he will kiss his mother, leave this home, and
down the street make his way to a liquor saloon, where often vile
pictures hang on the walls, cards lie on the table instead of the
family Bible and the air is freighted with oaths and obscenities.

Boys, have any of you done this within the past month, or six months?
Promise me now you will never do this again. Oh what a grand meeting
this would be if every young man and boy in my presence would make the
promise! I plead with you, young man, by the sleepless nights your
mother spent to give you rest; by the shadow you have hung over her
pathway; by the bleeding heart you've wounded but which loves you
still:

  "Come back, my boy, come back, I say,
  And walk now in thy mother's way."

I would that every boy in our land were as grateful to his mother as
was that Southern girl to her father, who stood years ago in front of
an open fire, her back to the fire, her face toward the door, her bare
arms full of flowers, waiting for her brother to call with a carriage
to take her to a party. While standing there a flame caught her dress;
she gave a scream, dropped the flowers and ran through the door to
where her father was standing in the yard. When the father saw his
child coming with flame following, he ran toward her. As he ran he
took off his coat and wrapping it about her face, arms and shoulders,
threw her to the ground. With his left hand he kept the flame from the
body, while with his right hand he fought the fire. He saved his
daughter but burned his right arm to the elbow. Day after day when the
doctor would unwrap the arm to dress it, the girl, though burned
herself, would go to her father's bed, gently lift the burned arm and
caress it. When the father recovered his hand was so maimed and
scarred, that when introduced to strangers, he would hold his right
hand behind him and shake hands with the left. One day his daughter,
seeing him do this, went to his side and reaching for the scarred
hand, held it to her lips and kissed it. She was not ashamed, for that
hand had been burned for her. When the father died and lay in his
casket ready for burial, the family came to take their last look.
First came the mother of the girl, then a brother and sister, and then
the girl herself. She kissed the cold brow of her father, then
kneeling she took up the disfigured hand and kissed it over and over
again. My boy, your mother has suffered more for you than that father
did for his daughter. I beg you, go home and kiss your mother. If she
is dead or far from you, kiss her memory. Go to your bed room, kneel
there, and pray God to help you to live worthy the love of your
mother.

I now turn from young men to parents and say, use every means possible
to make safe the way of your boys. Some years ago in one of our
cities, after a lecture in which I appealed to parents, a leading
merchant of the city said: "I wish I had heard that lecture years
ago."

"You never used liquor?" I said.

"No, but I am responsible for its use in my family. I am a Methodist,
and a total abstainer. In my employ I had a number of clerks, and let
it be known I would not allow any of them to drink even moderately.
One day a man came to my store with a paper in his hand and said: 'I
want to set up a saloon on the next block and I am getting signers to
my petition. I am one of your customers; you know me and know I will
keep an orderly place.' I said to myself, 'if he doesn't sell others
will and we need the revenue anyway,' so I signed the petition. A few
months later I chanced to see my youngest boy and one of my clerks
coming out of the door of that saloon. Soon after when they entered
the store I called them into my office and said: 'Young men, did I see
you coming out of a saloon, and had you been taking a drink in there?'
When they admitted they had, I said to my son: 'Did I ever set such an
example for you to follow?' He answered: 'No, father, but you signed
that man's petition to set up the saloon; whom did you expect him to
sell to? Did you sign it for him to sell to other fathers' sons and
not yours?' I realized as never before the wrong I had done, not only
to my own son, but to every father's son to whom that saloon-keeper
would sell if they had the money to pay for liquor. I said: "Forgive
me, my boy. Promise me you will never enter a saloon again and I
promise never to sign a petition or vote to have a saloon-keeper sell
to anybody's boy!"

But it was too late; that boy went to ruin and carried his old father
to financial ruin with him. The store was sold and the father went on
to a little farm in Missouri, where he died a disappointed,
grief-stricken man. He was a good man and a kind father, but he did
not realize the full meaning of the warning, "whatsoever ye sow, that
shall ye also reap." Fathers, be careful of your example. Your sons
think they can safely follow where you lead. Could the turf break
above the drunken dead; could they come back to earth in their bony
whiteness to testify to the cause of their ruin, how many would point
to the old sideboard filled with all kinds of liquors, to father's
moderate use of strong drink, or his vote for the saloon at the ballot
box.

Too often the careless indulgence of mothers is responsible for the
ruin of their sons. If mothers were as watchful of their sons as of
their daughters, the magic chain of mother love would be far more
binding to their boys. There are homes in this city where at night you
can hear the mothers say to servants: "Are the clothes in off the
line; did you bring the broom and the pitcher from the porch; are the
blinds all down; are the girls in bed; is everything in order for the
night?" No, mothers, everything is not in order. Your girls are safe,
the windows and doors are locked, but your boys are on the outside
with night keys in their pockets, to come in at midnight from God only
knows where. The double standard reaches too often back into the home.

  "Mother, watch the little feet,
    Climbing o'er the garden wall,
  Bounding through the busy street,
    Ranging garret shed and hall:
  Never count the time it cost,
    Never think the moments lost;
  Little feet will go astray,
    Watch them, mother, while you may.

  "Mother, watch the little tongue,
    Prattling, innocent and wild,
  What is said and what is sung
    By the joyous, happy child;
  Stop the word while yet unspoken;
    Seal the vow while yet unbroken,
  That same tongue may yet proclaim,
    Blessings in a Savior's name.

  "Mother, watch the little heart,
    Beating soft and warm for you;
  Wholesome lessons now impart,
    Keep, O keep, that young heart pure.
  Extricating every weed,
    Sowing good and precious seed;
  Harvests rich you then shall see,
    Ripening for eternity."

Once more I turn to the young men to say, if you would make life safe
take the Bible as the man of your counsel and the guide of your life;
love God and keep His commandments. In this age of glittering
literature, many consider the Bible dull reading. Sir William Jones,
one of England's greatest jurists and scholars, said: "I have
carefully perused the Bible, and independent of its divine origin, I
believe it contains more true sublimity, more exquisite beauty, purer
morality, more important history and finer strains of poetry and
eloquence than could be contained within the same compass, from all
the books ever published in any age or any idiom."

A passionate lover of poetry has said: "The Bible is a mass of
beautiful figures. It has pressed into its service the animals of the
forest, the flowers of the fields and the stars of heaven; the lion,
spurning the sands of the desert; the wild roe, leaping the mountains;
the lamb led to the slaughter; the goat, fleeing to the wilderness;
the Rose of Sharon; the Lily of the Valley; the great rock in a weary
land; Carmel by the sea; Tabor in the mountains; the rain and mown
grass; the sun and moon and morning stars. Thus hath the Bible swept
creation to lay its trophies upon the altar of Jehovah." Patrick Henry
continually sought the Bible for gems of expression, while today the
politician on the rostrum and the lawyer at the bar, quote the Bible
to give force and effect to their speeches.

Some say: "There is so much in the Bible we cannot comprehend." Yes,
there's very much in there doubtless God did not intend you should
understand. One wades in the ocean knee deep, waist deep, neck deep,
and gives it up that he can't wade the ocean. If God had intended one
should wade the ocean He would have made it shallow enough to wade.
So, one finds he can climb to the mountain's top, or sail thousands of
feet above the mountain in an air ship, but he can't sail to the
skies. Two good women went to Sam Jones and said: "Mr. Jones, here are
several passages of scripture we don't understand. We have been to
several ministers and they cannot explain them satisfactorily; perhaps
you can." The great evangelist said: "Sisters, you haven't as much
good hard sense as my cow. We keep a cow and through the winter we
give her hay to eat. Now Georgia hay has a considerable mixture of
briars. When we give the cow an arm full of hay she has sense enough
to eat the hay and let the briars alone. But with the blessed Bible
full of good hay, you are 'chawing' away on the briars." Young people,
there is enough in God's word you can understand to serve you if you
live a thousand years, enough in there to save you if you die tonight,
so don't worry over what you can't understand.

During the Civil War a terrible battle raged all day between the
armies of Grant and Lee. When the night shadows shut out the light,
dead and dying were strewn for miles. Surgeons were busy and the
chaplains going their rounds. A chaplain heard a voice say, in clarion
tone: "Here." Going to the spot from whence came the voice and bending
over the prostrate form of a dying soldier, the chaplain asked: "What
can I do for you?"

"Nothing, sir; they were just calling the roll in Heaven, and I was
answering to my name."

Blessed book, in which there is enough a wounded soldier, dying far
away from home and loved ones, can so understand as to fit him to
answer the roll call in Heaven.

We may not comprehend the full meaning of faith, but we can grasp
sufficient to be to our souls what the force of nature is to the
trees, by which they stand with their branches reaching skyward and
their roots drawing earth-centerward. Take from me this faith and you
take away the best friend I ever had, the friend that stood by me in
the darkest hour of my life, when a daughter in the bloom of womanhood
said, "good-bye," and went away to live with the angels; that stands
by me now pointing to where my child is waiting for me in the bowers
that kiss the very porch of Heaven. Without this faith how awful would
be the dirge, "earth to earth, dust to dust." Blessed book that tells
us we shall meet "beyond the river, where the surges cease to roll;"
that death is but the doorway to a better land, "the grave a subway to
a sweeter clime."

My dear young friends, accept this faith and you will find in it a
sweet companion up the hillward way of life, and down the sunset slope
to the valley of death, where it will not leave nor forsake you, but
will wait till you throw off your "burden of clay," then "bear you
away on its balmy wings to your eternal home." Young men, may you so
follow the safe side of life, that when its great trials come, you can
with the wings of faith cleave the clouds and soar safely above the
thunders that roll at your feet.

My closing advice is, "Walk not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stand in the way of sinners; but delight in the law of the Lord; and
in his law meditate day and night. In due season your life will fruit
and whatsoever you do will prosper."


VI

PLATFORM EXPERIENCES.


Though announced to lecture on Platform Experiences, it is my purpose
to give you a kind of platform analysis, to tell you what I know about
lecturing, lectures, oratory and orators, using personal experiences
for illustration.

We have about eight thousand Chautauqua days, and fifteen thousand
lecture courses in this country every year, and yet comparatively few
persons know the history of the platform. Many have an idea that free
speech, like free air, has ever been a boon to mankind. They have no
conception of what it has cost, in imprisonment, exile, blood and
tears.

I am indebted to "Pond's History of the Platform" for facts and
illustrations in the early history of the platform in England. Two
hundred years ago in our mother land, the word platform meant no more
than a resting place for boxes and barrels. A religious service was
simply a routine of ritual, while such a thing as a public man
addressing the masses was unknown. Sir William Pitt, one of England's
greatest statesman and orators, in all his public life uttered only
two sentences to the public outside of Parliament. If William Jennings
Bryan had lived in Pitt's day, he would have been ignored by the Prime
Minister of England.

The first leaders of thought to come in contact with the people and
thrill them by the power of speech were John Wesley and George
Whitefield. "On a mount called Rose Hill, near Bristol, England,
George Whitefield laid the foundation of the modern platform." From
Rose Hill his audiences grew until on Kensington Commons thirty
thousand people tried to get within reach of his captivating voice. It
has been truthfully said: "At the feet of John Wesley and George
Whitefield the people of England learned their first lessons in
popular government."

This innovation, however, met with sneers, jeers and persecution from
the established conservatism of church and state, and when the
platform attempted to enter the arena of politics, Parliament decided
the "public clamor must end." A bill was framed forbidding any public
gatherings except such as should be called by the magistrates.

In advocating this bill a member of Parliament said: "The art of
political discussion does not belong outside of Parliament. Men who
are simply merchants, mechanics and farmers must not be allowed to
publicly criticise the constitution." To this the platform made reply:
"From such as we the Master selected those who were to sow the seed of
living bread in the wilds of Galilee." The bill passed by an
overwhelming majority. Punishment ran from fine and imprisonment to
years of exile from the country, and from this time on, the battle
raged between Parliament and platform. Later on we shall note the
results.

I am often interviewed by men, and sometimes by women, who desire to
reach the platform. They say to me: "What steps did you take?"

My answer is, I never took any; I stumbled, was picked up by
circumstances and pitched upon the platform.

At a picnic in a grove near Winchester, Ky., in 1869, a noted
temperance orator was to give an address. He failed to reach the grove
on time, and I was prevailed upon to act as time-killer until his
arrival. I was not entirely without experience, having belonged to a
debating society in a country school.

When I had spoken about thirty minutes, to my great relief, the orator
of the day made his appearance. The flattering comments upon my talk
induced me to accept other invitations to address temperance meetings,
and before I knew what had happened, the platform was under my feet,
calls were numerous and my life work was established. I suppose those
who consult me are encouraged to know a mere stumble directed my
course, and if so, by purpose and preparation they can surely succeed.

Some persons seem to think lecturing a very simple occupation,
requiring only a glib tongue, and a good pair of lungs. Several years
ago, I received a letter from a young man in which he wrote: "I heard
you lecture last week. I would like to become a lecturer myself. I
have no experience and very little education, but I have a very strong
voice and am sure I could be heard by a large audience. I have been
working in a horse-barn but am now out of a job. If I had a lecture, I
think I could make a living; besides I would get to see the country.
If you will write me one I will send you two dollars." I do not know
whether the young man gauged the price by the estimate of the lecture
he had heard me give, or his monetary condition, but if audacity is a
requisite for the platform, this young man was not entirely without
qualification.

This is an extreme case, and yet there are those whose minds are
storehouses of knowledge, who can no more become popular platform
speakers, than could the young man, who was ready to set sail on the
sea of oratory, with a lusty pair of lungs and a two dollar lecture.

Charles Spurgeon, the great London preacher, said: "I have never yet
learned the art of lecturing. If you have ever seen a goose fly, you
have seen Spurgeon trying to lecture."

Mr. Spurgeon called lecturing an art, and why not? If the hand that
paints a picture true to life and pleasing to the eye, is the hand of
an artist, why is not the tongue that paints a picture true to life
and pleasing to the mind's eye the tongue of an artist?

It is an art to know how to get hold of an audience. There was an
occasion in my experience when I had extreme necessity for the use of
this art. When President Cleveland wrote his Venezuela message in
which he threatened war with England, the threat was published in
Toronto, Canada, on Saturday and I was announced to lecture in the
large pavilion on Sunday afternoon.

The message of President Cleveland had aroused the patriotic spirit of
Canada. The hall was packed. It seemed to me I could see frost upon
the eyebrows of every man and icicles in the ears of the women.

When introduced there was a painful silence. I began by saying:
"Doubtless many of you have come to hear what an American has to say
about Venezuela. I must admit I am not acquainted with the merits of
the question. I suppose, however, the message of our President is one
of the arts of diplomacy. But I do know I speak the sentiment of the
best people of my country when I say: 'May the day never dawn whose
peace will be broken by signal guns of war between Great Britain and
the United States.'" I said:

  "When John and Jonathan forget,
  The scar of anger's wound to fret,
  And smile to think of an ancient feud,
  Which the God of nations turned to good;
  Then John and Jonathan will be,
  Abiding friends, o'er land and sea;
  In their one great purpose, the world will ken,
  Peace on earth, goodwill to men."

The great audience arose and cheered until all sense of chill had
departed.

It is not only an art to get hold of an audience, but equally a matter
of good taste to know when to let go. This is a qualification some
have not acquired. I followed a very distinguished man several years
ago and the comment was: "He was fine the first hour and a half, but
the last hour he grew tiresome."

In this busy age, the world wants thoughts packed into small compass.
The average audience wants a preacher to put his best thoughts into a
thirty-minute package. The day was, when people would sit on backless
board benches and listen to a sermon of two hours; now they won't
swing in a hammock and endure one of more than fifty minutes.

Rev. Dr. Dewey, of Brooklyn, New York, tells of a minister who was
given to reading his sermons. On one occasion when he had read about
twenty minutes, he halted and said: "I have a young dog at my house
that is given to chewing paper. I find he has mutilated my manuscript,
which is my excuse for this short sermon." A visiting lady after
service said: "Doctor, have you any more of the breed of that dog? I
would like to get one for our pastor."

In this age of crowded moments concentration means executation; energy
means success. If you can't put fire into your sermon, put your sermon
in the fire.

A few years ago when in New York City, I went to see Madame Bernhardt
in her famous play, Joan of Arc. She spoke in French, an unknown
tongue to me; but when she came to her defense before the court, I
realized as never before the power of speech and action. She had given
one-fourth of that marvelous appeal, when the great audience arose and
began to cheer. Madame Bernhardt folded her arms, bowed her head and
waited for silence.

When order was restored she sprang a step forward. It seemed to me
every feature of her face, every finger on her hands, every gleam of
eye and movement of body was an appeal to the stern tribunal. In the
trembling, murmuring voice that ran like a strain of sad, sweet music
through sunless gorges of grief, the great audience read her plea for
mercy and wept. Some who could not restrain their emotion sobbed
aloud.

When from the depths of solemn sound that same voice arose like the
swell of a silver trumpet, and in clarion tones demanded justice,
cheer after cheer testified to the power of the orator actress. Never
was there a sob of the sea more mournful, than the voice of Sarah
Bernhardt as she played upon the harp strings of pity; and never did
words rush in greater storm fury from human lips, than when she
demanded justice. No stop nor note nor pedal nor key in the organ of
speech was left untouched by this genius in tragic art.

It would be well if every public speaker could hear Sarah Bernhardt
give that defense of the Maid of Orleans. Indeed I believe if the
forensic eloquence of the stage could be transferred to the pulpit
greater audiences and greater rewards would follow. If you doubt this,
go read the sermons of George Whitefield or the lectures of John B.
Gough and you will wonder at their success unless you take into
consideration their mysterious power of delivery.

I cannot give you one sentence Madame Bernhardt uttered, but I do know
the influence of that address remains with me to this day and now and
then I find myself reaching out after the secret of oratory. "It is
not so much what you say as how you say it," has become a proverb.

Some years ago I lectured in an Iowa village on a bitter cold evening.
The rear of the hall was up on posts. When introduced there was only
one inch between my shoe soles and zero, while a cold wind from a
broken window struck the back of my head. It occurred to me that if I
would play Bernhardt I might save a spell of pneumonia.

In a few moments I was pacing the platform, swinging my arms and
stamping my feet to keep up circulation. I put all the intensity,
activity and personality possible into one hour and left the platform.

Returning to the hotel a commercial traveler who had heard me a number
of times said: "I congratulate you; you get younger. I never heard you
put so much life into your lecture."

I replied: "Why man, I was trying to keep my feet from freezing."

He said: "I advise you to go on the platform every evening with cold
feet."

John and Charles Wesley were going along a street in London when they
came upon two market women engaged in a wordy war. John Wesley said:
"Hold up, Charles, and let's learn how to preach. See how these women
put earnestness and even eloquence into their street quarrel. Can't we
be just as earnest and eloquent in dealing out the truth?" No wonder
John Wesley gave such impetus to the platform.

It is said what John Wesley and George Whitefield were to the
religious platform, Fox and Burke became later on to the political
platform. They saw the platform was fast becoming the voice of public
sentiment and dared to indorse it.

When Mr. Fox made his first platform address he said: "This is the
first time I ever had the privilege of addressing an uncorrupted
assembly." Going back into Parliament he said: "Let's put an end to a
policy that separates us from the people. Let's cut all cables, snap
all chains that bind us to an unfriendly shore and enter the peaceful
harbor of public confidence."

When Mr. Burke made his platform debut, he was so inspired by the
enthusiasm of the people, it is said, he made the greatest speech ever
made in the English language up to that time. When he appeared in
Parliament next evening a leader of the government took occasion to
denounce the platform as a disturber of public peace, directing his
remarks to Mr. Burke. The great orator was ready with the reply: "Yes,
and the firebell at midnight disturbs public peace, but it keeps you
from burning in your beds."

It would seem after years of fruitless effort to silence the platform,
Parliament would accept it as a power for good and give it wise
direction. Yet we are informed that in face of its growing popularity
when Henry Hunt attempted to address an audience in a grove in
England, a regiment of cavalry charged the grove. Eleven were killed
and several hundred wounded. Henry Hunt was thrown into prison, but
when released later one hundred thousand people welcomed him to the
streets of London.

As well now had Parliament attempted to prevent a London fog as to
prohibit platform meetings. John Bright said: "When I consider these
meetings of the people, so sublime in their vastness and resolution, I
see coming over the hilltops of time the dawning of a nobler and
better day for my country."

It is our privilege to live in the good day of which John Bright
spoke. Yet while a public speaker today is in no dread of arrest or
imprisonment for any decent expression of opinion, the platform is not
without its hindrances; and some of these will never be cured, while
babies cry, architects sacrifice acoustics to style, young people do
their courting in public, janitors smother thoughts in foul air, and
milliners persist in building up artistic barriers between speaker and
audience.

Here let me give a bit of advice to my own sex. Gentlemen, when you
purchase a new hat, no matter if a ten dollar silk, or a twenty dollar
panama, do not attend a lecture, and taking a seat in front of some
intelligent lady forget to remove your hat. The lady may want to see
the speaker's face, and he may need the inspiration of her
countenance, while you are interfering with both. "A hint to the wise
is sufficient." This hint may not be in accord with the advice of
Paul, but Paul never saw a twentieth century "Merry Widow" hat. Then
too, Paul was already inspired and didn't need the inspiration of
human countenances. I am speaking for the uninspired, to whom an
audience of hatless heads is an inspiration.

But few persons realize how a public speaker is affected by little
influences. The flitting of a blind bat over a church audience on a
summer evening, will mar the most fascinating flight of eloquence ever
plumed from a pulpit.

When Nancy Hanks broke the world's trotting record at Independence,
Iowa, some years ago, her former owner, Mr. Hart Boswell, of
Lexington, who raised and trained her, was asked if Nancy would ever
lower that record. He replied: "Well, if the time comes that the track
is just right, the atmosphere just right, the driver just right and
Nancy just right, I believe she will." See the combination. Break it
anywhere and the brave little mare would fail.

Just so speakers are affected by conditions, by acoustics, atmosphere,
size and temper of the audience, and the speaker's own mental and
physical condition. Many a good sermon has been killed by a poor
sexton. Many a grand thought has perished in foul air.

Charles Spurgeon was preaching to a large audience in a mission church
in London, when want of ventilation affected speaker and audience. Mr.
Spurgeon said to a member of the church: "Brother, lift that window
near you."

"It won't lift," replied the brother.

"Then smash the glass and I'll pay the bill to-morrow," said Spurgeon.

Suppose the great horse Uhlan should be announced to trot against his
record; suppose at the appointed time, with the grandstand crowded and
every condition favorable, as the great trotting wonder reached the
first quarter pole, some one were to run across the track just ahead
of the horse, then another and another; what kind of a record would be
made?

What management would allow a horse to be thus handicapped? Where is
the man who would be so inconsiderate as to thus hinder a horse? Yet
when a minister has worked while the world slept, that he not only
might sustain his record but gather souls into the kingdom; when the
opening exercises have given sufficient time for all to be present;
when the text is announced and the preacher is reaching out after the
attention and sympathy of his audience some one enters the door, walks
nearly the full length of the aisle; then another and then two more,
each one crossing the track of the preacher and yet he is expected to
keep up his record and make good. If you are a friend of your pastor
be present when he announces his text; give him your attention and
thus cheer him on as you would your favorite horse.

An eminent minister said: "There, I had a good thought for you, but
the creaking of the new boots of that brother coming down the aisle
knocked it quite out of my head."

One who had heard me many times said: "Why do you do better at Ocean
Grove than anywhere else I hear you?" My answer was: "Because of
conditions. The great auditorium seats ten thousand, the atmosphere is
invigorated by salt sea breezes; a choir of five hundred sing the
audience into a receptive mood and the speaker is borne from climax to
climax on wings of applause."

I would not have you infer from this that a large audience is always
necessary to success. Indeed the most successful and satisfactory
address I ever made was to an audience of one. If I can make as
favorable an impression upon you as I did upon that young lady I shall
be gratified.

In Pauling, New York, Chauncey M. Depew by his attention and applause
inspired me more than the whole audience beside; while time and again
have I been helped to do my best by the presence of that matchless
queen of the platform, Frances E. Willard.

The very opposite of greatness has had the same effect upon me. At the
Pontiac, Illinois, Chautauqua after lecturing to a great audience, I
was invited by the superintendent of the State Reformatory to address
the inmates of the prison. At the close of a thirty minutes' talk the
superintendent said: "Your address to my boys exceeded the one you
gave at the Chautauqua."

Why was it better? At the Chautauqua I was trying to entertain and
instruct an intelligent audience. Within the grey walls of that prison
I was reaching down to the very depths, endeavoring to lift up human
beings, marred and scarred by sin and crime, but dear to the mothers
who bore them and the Savior who died for them.

If I were a preacher in New York City and were announced to preach a
sermon on home missionary work I would not go to the church by way of
the mansions of the rich where children, shod in satin slippers dance
and play over velvet tapestry, but by way of the slums where I would
meet the children of misery, where,

  "To stand at night 'mid the city's throng,
  And scan the faces that pass along,
  Is to read a book whose every leaf
  Is a history of woe and want and grief.
  As in tears of sorrow and sin and shame,
  You read a story of blight and blame,
  Your heart goes further than hand can reach
  And you feel a sermon you cannot preach."

Whoever would prove worthy of the platform must have a message and
give to it the devotion of mind, heart and conscience, no matter
whether his purpose is to convince by reasoning, convert by appeal,
delight by rhetoric, or cure melancholy by humor. Each has its useful
influence on the platform.

Some persons have an impression that the student deals in logic, while
the orator simply starts his tongue to running, and goes off and
leaves it to work automatically.

Bishop Robert McIntyre was one of the greatest pulpit orators of his
age, yet I dare say this gifted man gave as much time and thought to
his famous word painting of the Chicago fire, as Joseph Cook ever gave
to mining any treasure of thought he laid upon the altar of education.

I know many teachers of oratory say: "Study your subject, analyze it
well, and leave words to the inspiration of the occasion." But suppose
when the occasion comes, instead of inspiration one has indigestion,
then what?

While a speaker should not be so confined to composition that he
cannot reach out after, and cage any passing bird of thought, yet as
the leaf of the mulberry tree must go through the stomach of a
silk-worm, before it can become silk, so climaxes should be warped and
woofed into language before they can be forceful and beautiful.

The man had dignity of sentiments much above his condition, and
though death was denounced against all who concealed the king, and a
great reward promised to any one who should betray him, he professed
and maintained unshaken fidelity. He took the assistance of his four
brothers, equally honorable with himself: and having clothed the
king in a garb like their own, they led him into the neighboring wood,
put a bill in his hand, and pretended to employ themselves in
cutting fagots. Some nights he lay upon straw in the house, and fed
on such homely fare as it afforded.

For a better concealment, he mounted upon an oak, where he sheltered
himself among the leaves and branches for twenty-four hours.
He saw several soldiers pass by. All of them were intent in search of
the king; and some expressed in his hearing their earnest wishes
of seizing him. This tree was afterwards denominated the royal oak,
and for many years was regarded by the neighborhood with great
veneration.

Charles was in the middle of the kingdom, and could neither stay in
his retreat, nor stir a step from it, without the most imminent
danger.
Fears, hopes, and party zeal interested multitudes to discover
him; and even the smallest indiscretion of his friends might prove
fatal.

Having joined Lord Wilmot, who was skulking in the neighborhood, they
agreed to put themselves into the hands of Colonel Lane, a zealous
royalist, who lived at Bentley, not many miles distant. The king's
feet were so hurt by walking about in heavy boots or countrymen's
shoes which did not fit him, that he was obliged to mount on
horseback; and he travelled in this situation to Bentley, attended
by the Penderells, who had been so faithful to him.

Lane formed a scheme for his journey to Bristol, where, it was hoped,
he would find a ship in which he might transport himself.
He had a near kinswoman, Mrs. Norton, who lived within three miles
of that city, and was with child, very near the time of her delivery.

He obtained a pass (for during those times of confusion this precaution
was requisite) for his sister, Jane Lane, and a servant, to travel
towards Bristol, under pretence of visiting and attending her
relation.

The king rode before the lady, and personated the servant.

When they arrived at Norton's, Mrs. Lane pretended that she had brought
along, as her servant, a poor lad, a neighboring farmer's son, who was
ill of an ague; and she begged a private room for him, where he
might be quiet.

Though Charles kept himself retired in this chamber, the butler, one
Pope, soon knew him: the king was alarmed, but made the butler promise
that he would keep the secret from every mortal, even from his master;
and he was faithful to his engagement.

No ship, it was found, would for a month set sail from Bristol, either
for France or Spain, and the king was obliged to go elsewhere for
a passage.

He intrusted himself to Colone Windham of Dorsetshire, an affectionate
partisan of the royal family. The natural effect of the long civil
wars, and of the furious rage to which all men were wrought up in
their different factions, was, that every one's inclinations and
affections were thoroughly known; and even the courage and fidelity
of most men, by the variety of incidents, had been put to trial.

The royalists, too, had, many of them, been obliged to make concealments
in their houses for themselves, their friends, or more valuable effects;
and the arts of eluding the enemy had been frequently practised.

All these circumstances proved favorable to the king in the
present exigency. As he often passed through the hands of Catholics,
the priests hole, as they called it, the place where they were obliged
to conceal their persecuted priests, was sometimes employed for sheltering
their distressed sovereign.

Windham, before he received the king, asked leave to intrust the
important secret to his mother, his wife, and four servants, on
whose fidelity he could rely.

Of all these, no one proved wanting either in honor or discretion.
The venerable old matron, on the reception of her royal guest, expressed
the utmost joy, that having lost, without regret, three sons and one
grandchild in defence of his father, she was now reserved, in her
declining years, to be instrumental in the preservation of himself.
Windham told the king, that Sir Thomas, his father, in the year
1636, a few days before his death, called to him his five sons.

"My children," said he, "we have hitherto seen serene and quiet times
under our three last sovereigns: but I must now warn you to prepare for
clouds and storms. Factions arise on every side, and threaten
the tranquillity of your native country. But whatever happen, do you
faithfully honor and obey your prince, and adhere to the crown. I
charge you never to forsake the crown, though it should hang upon
a bush." "These last words," added Windham, "made such impressions
on all our breasts, that the many afflictions of these sad times
could never efface their indelible characters." From innumerable
instances, it appears how deep rooted, in the minds of the English
gentry of that age, was the principle of loyalty to their sovereign;
that noble and generous principle, inferior only in excellence to
the more enlarged and more enlightened affection towards a legal
constitution. But during those times of military usurpation, these
passions were the same.

  
    The king continued several
  days in Windham's house; and
    all his friends in Britain, and in every part of Europe, remained
in the most anxious suspense with regard to his fortunes: no one
could conjecture whether he were dead or alive; and the report of
his death, being generally believed, happily relaxed the vigilant
search of his enemies.

Trials were made to procure a vessel for his escape; but he still met
with disappointments. Having left Windham's house, he was obliged again
to return to it. He passed through many other adventures; assumed
different disguises; in every step was exposed to imminent perils
and received daily proofs of uncorrupted fidelity and attachment.

The sagacity of a smith, who remarked that his horse's shoes had been
made in the north, not in the west, as he pretended, once detected
him; and he narrowly escaped. At Shoreham, in Sussex, a vessel was at
last found, in which he embarked. He had been known to so many,
that if he had not set sail in that critical moment, it had been
impossible for him to escape. After one and forty days' concealment,
he arrived safely at Fescamp, in Normandy. No less than forty
men and women had at different times been privy to his concealment
and escape.[*]
The battle of Worcester, afforded Cromwell what he called his
"crowning mercy."[**] So elated was he, that he intended to have
knighted in the field two of his generals, Lambert and Fleetwood;
but was dissuaded by his friends from exerting this act of regal
authority.

His power and ambition were too great to brook submission to the empty
name of a republic, which stood chiefly by his influence, and was
supported by his victories. How early he entertained thoughts of taking
into his hand the reins of government, is uncertain. We are only
assured, that he now discovered to his intimate friends these aspiring
views; and even expressed a desire of assuming the rank of king, which
he had contributed with such seeming zeal to abolish.[***]
The little popularity and credit acquired by the republicans, further
stimulated the ambition of this enterprising politician. These men
had not that large thought, nor those comprehensive views, which
might qualify them for acting the part of legislators: selfish aims
and bigotry chiefly engrossed their attention.

They carried their rigid austerity so far as to enact a law declaring
fornication, after the first act, to be felony, without benefit of
clergy.[****] They made small progress in that important work which
they professed to have so much at heart, the settling of a new model
of representation, and a bill was introduced into the house against
painting, patches, and other immodest dress of women; but it did
not pass.

The nation began to apprehend that they intended to establish
themselves as a perpetual legislature, and to confine the whole power
to sixty or seventy persons, who called themselves the parliament
of the commonwealth of England. And while they pretended to bestow new
liberties upon the nation, they found themselves obliged to infringe
even the most valuable of those which, through time immemorial, had
been transmitted from their ancestors.

Not daring to intrust the trials of treason to juries, who, being chosen
indifferently from among the people, would have been little favorable
to the commonwealth, and would have formed their verdict upon the
ancient laws, they eluded that noble institution, by which the government
of this island has ever been so much distinguished. They had
evidently seen in the trial of Lilburn what they could expect
from juries. This man, the most turbulent, but the most upright
and courageous of human kind, was tried for a transgression of the
new statute of treasons: but though he was plainly guilty, he was
acquitted, to the great joy of the people.

Westminster Hall, nay, the whole city, rang with shouts and acclamations.
Never did any established power receive so strong a declaration
of its usurpation and invalidity; and from no institution, besides
the admirable one of juries, could be expected this magnanimous
effort.

That they might not for the future be exposed to affronts which so
much lessened their authority, the parliament erected a high court of
justice, which was to receive indictments from the council of
state.
This court was composed of men devoted to the ruling party, without
name or character, determined to sacrifice every thing to their own
safety or ambition. Colonel Eusebius Andrews and Colonel Walter
Slingsby were tried by this court for conspiracies, and condemned to
death. They were royalists, and refused to plead before so illegal
a jurisdiction. Love, Gibbons, and other Presbyterians, having
entered into a plot against the republic, were also tried, condemned,
and executed. The earl of Derby, Sir Timothy Featherstone, Bemboe,
being taken prisoners after the battle of Worcester, were put to
death by sentence of a court martial; a method of proceeding
declared illegal by that very petition of right, for which a former
parliament had so strenuously contended, and which, after great
efforts, they had extorted from the king.

Excepting their principles of toleration, the maxims by which the
republicans regulated ecclesiastical affairs no more prognosticated
any durable settlement, than those by which they conducted their civil
concerns. The Presbyterian model of congregations, classes, and
assemblies was not allowed to be finished: it seemed even the intention
of many leaders in the parliament to admit of no established church,
and to leave every one, without any guidance of the magistrate,
to embrace whatever sect and to support whatever clergy were most
agreeable to him.

The parliament went so far as to make some approaches, in one province,
to their Independent model. Almost all the clergy of Wales being ejected
as malignants, itinerant preachers with small salaries were settled,
not above four or five in each county; and these, being furnished
with horses at the public expense, hurried from place to place, and
carried, as they expressed themselves, the glad tidings of the
gospel.[*] They were all of them men of the lowest birth and
education, who had deserted mechanical trades, in order to follow
this new profession.

And in this particular, as well as in their wandering life, they
pretended to be more truly apostolical.

* Dr. John Walker's Attempt, p. 147, et seq.

The republicans, both by the turn of their disposition, and by the nature
of the instruments which they employed, were better qualified for
acts of force and vigor, than for the slow and deliberate work of
legislation.

Notwithstanding the late wars and bloodshed, and the present factions,
the power of England had never, in any period, appeared so
formidable to the neighboring kingdoms as it did at this time, in the
hands of the commonwealth.

A numerous army served equally to retain every one in implicit
subjection to established authority, and to strike a terror into
foreign nations. The power of peace and war was lodged in the same
hands with that of imposing taxes; and no difference of views,
among the several members of the legislature, could any longer be
apprehended.

The present impositions, though much superior to what had ever formerly
been experienced, were in reality moderate, and what a nation so
opulent could easily bear.

The military genius of the people had, by the civil contests, been roused
from its former lethargy; and excellent officers were formed in
every branch of service. The confusion into which all things had
been thrown, had given opportunity to men of low stations to break
through their obscurity, and to raise themselves by their courage
to commands which they were well qualified to exercise, but to which
their birth could never have entitled them.

And while so great a power was lodged in such active hands, no wonder
the republic was successful in all its enterprises.

Blake, a man of great courage and a generous disposition the
same person who had defended Lyme and Taunten with such unshaken obstinacy
against the late king, was made an admiral; and though he had hitherto
been accustomed only to land service, into which, too, he had not
entered till past fifty years of age, he soon raised the naval glory
of the nation to a greater height than it had ever attained in any
former period. A fleet was put under his command, and he received
orders to pursue Prince Rupert, to whom the king had intrusted
that squadron which had deserted to him.

Rupert took shelter in Kinsale; and escaping thence, fled towards
the coast of Portugal.

Blake pursued, and chased him into the Tagus, where he intended to
make an attack upon him. But the king of Portugal, moved by the favor
which throughout all Europe attended the royal cause, refused
Blake admittance, and aided Prince Rupert in making his escape. To
be revenged of this partiality, the English admiral made prize of
twenty Portuguese ships, richly laden; and he threatened still
further vengeance. The king of Portugal, dreading so dangerous a
foe to his newly-acquired dominion, and sensible of the unequal contest
in which he was engaged, made all possible submissions to the haughty
republic, and was at last admitted to negotiate the renewal of his
alliance with England. Prince Rupert, having lost a great part of his
squadron on the coast of Spain, made sail towards the West Indies. His
brother, Prince Maurice, was there shipwrecked in a hurricane. Every
where this squadron subsisted by privateering, sometimes on English,
sometimes on Spanish vessels.

And Rupert at last returned to France, where he disposed of the
remnants of his fleet, together with his prizes.

All the settlements in America, except New England, which had been
planted entirely by the Puritans, adhered to the royal party, even
after the settlement of the republic; and Sir George Ayscue was
sent with a squadron to reduce them.

Bermudas, Antigua, and Virginia were soon subdued. Barbadoes, commanded
by Lord Willoughby of Parham, made some resistance; but was at last
obliged to submit.

With equal ease were Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly, and the Isle of Man brought
under subjection to the republic; and the sea, which had been much
infested by privateers from these islands, was rendered safe to the
English commerce. The countess of Derby defended the Isle of Man; and
with great reluctance yielded to the necessity of surrendering to the
enemy. This lady, a daughter of the illustrious house of Trimoille,
in France, had, during the civil war, displayed a manly courage by her
obstinate defence of Latham House against the parliamentary forces;
and she retained the glory of being the last person in the three
kingdoms, and in all their dependent dominions, who submitted to
the victorious commonwealth.[*] [24]
* See note X, at the end of the volume.

Ireland and Scotland were now entirely subjected, and reduced to
tranquillity. Ireton, the new deputy of Ireland, at the head of a
numerous army, thirty thousand strong, prosecuted the work of subduing
the revolted Irish; and he defeated them in many rencounters, which,
though of themselves of no great moment, proved fatal to their declining
cause. He punished without mercy all the prisoners who had any hand
in the massacres. Sir Phelim O'Neale, among the rest, was some time
after brought to the gibbet, and suffered an ignominious death,
which he had so well merited by his inhuman cruelties.

Limeric, a considerable town, still remained in the hands of the Irish;
and Ireton, after a vigorous siege, made himself master of it. He was
here infected with the plague, and shortly after died; a memorable
personage, much celebrated for his vigilance, industry, capacity
even for the strict execution of justice in that unlimited command
which he possessed in Ireland.

He was observed to be inflexible in all his purposes; and it was
believed by many that he was animated with a sincere and passionate
love of liberty, and never could have been induced by any
motive to submit to the smallest appearance of regal government.
Cromwell appeared to be much affected by his death; and the republicans,
who reposed great confidence in him, were inconsolable.

To show their regard for his merit and services, they bestowed an
estate of two thousand pounds a year on his family, and honored
him with a magnificent funeral at the public charge. Though the established
government was but the mere shadow of a commonwealth, yet was
it beginning by proper arts, to encourage that public spirit, which
no other species of civil polity is ever able fully to inspire.

The command of the army in Ireland devolved on Lieutenant-General
Ludlow.
The civil government of the island was intrusted to commissioners.

Ludlow continued to push the advantages against the Irish, and every
where obtained an easy victory.

That unhappy people, disgusted with the king on account of those violent
declarations against them and their religion which had been
extorted by the Scots, applied to the king of Spain, to the duke
of Lorraine; and found assistance nowhere.
Clanricarde, unable to resist the prevailing power, made submissions
to the parliament, and retired into England, where he soon after
died.

He was a steady Catholic, but a man much respected by all parties.

The successes which attended Monk in Scotland were no less decisive.
That able general laid siege to Stirling Castle, and though it was well
provided for defence, it was soon surrendered to him.

That evening you made an earnest appeal to young men in the
name of home and mother. The arrow went to the heart of the wild young
fellow. On returning to the hotel he said to his companions: 'Come up
to my room, let's have a talk.' On entering the room he closed the
door and said: 'Boys, I want to open my heart to you. I am overwhelmed
with a sense of wrong-doing. I am done with the saloon, done with the
gambling table, done with evil associations. I am going home to-morrow
and make mother happy. Boys, let's join hands and swear off from drink
and evil habits; let's honor our manhood and our mothers.'

"Now for the sequel that I think will rest you. That wild boy is now a
wealthy man. I give you his name, though I would not have you call it
in public. He is a Christian philanthropist, and has never broken his
pledge. The second boy holds the highest office in the gift of this
government in a western territory, and the third stands before you
now, an humble minister of the gospel."

It did rest me. I would rather have been the humble instrument in
turning those three young men to a righteous life, than to wear the
brightest wreath that ever encircled a stateman's brow.

For such men as Sylvester Long, Roland A. Nichols, Robert Parker Miles
and Bishop Robert McIntyre to tell me my lectures helped to shape
their lives, fills my soul with joy as I face the setting sun.

Chance, the noted English engineer, built a thousand sea-lights,
shore-lights and harbor-lights. When in old age he lay dying, a wild
storm on the sea seemed to revive him by its association with his
life-work. He said to the watchers: "Lift me up and let me see once
more the ocean in a storm."

As he looked out, the red lightning ripped open the black wardrobe of
the firmament, and he saw the salted sea driven by the fury of the
hurricane into great billows of foam. Sinking back upon his pillows
his last words were: "Thank God, I have been a lighthouse builder, and
though the light of my life is fast fading, the beams of my lighthouse
are brightening the darkness of many a sailor's night."

When my life-work closes, and my platform experiences are ended, I
would ask no better name than that of an humble lighthouse builder,
who here and there from the shore-points of life's ocean, has sent out
a friendly beam, to brighten the darkness of some brother's night.


VII

THE DEFEAT OF THE NATION'S DRAGON.


Joseph Cook said in one of his Boston lectures: "Whenever the
temperance cause has attempted to fly with one wing, whether moral
suasion or legal suasion, its course has been a spiral one. It will
never accomplish its mission in this world, until it strikes the air
with equal vans, each wing keeping time with the other, both together
winnowing the earth of the tempter and the tempted."

I congratulate the friends of temperance upon the progress both wings
have made since the beginning of their flight.

The first temperance pledge we have any record of ran thus: "I
solemnly promise upon my word of honor I will abstain from everything
that will intoxicate, except at public dinners, on public holidays and
other important occasions." The first prohibitory law was a local law
in a village on Long Island and ran thus: "Any man engaged in the sale
of intoxicating liquors, who sells more than one quart of rum, whiskey
or brandy to four boys at one time shall be fined one dollar and two
pence."

A sideboard without brandy or rum was an exception, while the jug was
imperative at every log-raising and in the harvest field. It was said
of even a Puritan community,

  "Their only wish and only prayer,
  In the present world or world to come,
  Is a string of Eels and a jug of rum."

When Doctor Leonard Bacon was installed pastor of the First
Congregational Church in New Haven, Conn., in 1825, free drinks were
ordered at the bar of the hotel, for all visiting members, to be paid
for by the church. Today all protestant churches declare against the
drink habit and the drink sale. Pulpits are thundering away against
the saloon. Children are studying the effects of alcohol upon the
human system in nearly every state in the Union. Train loads of
literature are pouring into the homes of the people. A mighty army of
as godly women as ever espoused a cause is battling for the home,
against the saloon. The business world is demanding total-abstainers,
and fifty millions of people in the United States are living under
prohibitory laws.

Not only in this but in every civilized land the cause of temperance
is growing. Recently in France it was found there were more deaths
than births, which meant France was dying. A commission was appointed
to look into the causes. When the report was made, alcohol headed the
list. Now by order of the government linen posters are put up in
public buildings, and on these in blood red letters are these
warnings: "Alcohol dangerous; alcohol chronic poison; alcohol leads to
the following diseases; alcohol is the enemy of labor; alcohol
disrupts the home!"

Who would have thought an Emperor of Germany would ever "go back" on
beer? Emperor William in an address to the sailors recommended
total-abstinence and forbid under penalty the giving of liquor to
soldiers in the world's greatest war. The Czar of Russia has put an
end to the government's connection with the manufacture of
intoxicating liquors, and our Secretary of the Navy has banished it
from the ships and navy yards. The New York Sun says: "The business
world is getting to be one great temperance league." For many years it
was confined to the realm of morals, but today it is recognized as a
great economic question and the business world is joining the church
world in solving the liquor problem.

While the temperance cause has been going up in character, the drink
has been going down in quality. The old time distiller used to select
his site along some crystal stream, that had its fountain-head in the
mountains and ran over beds of limestone. With sound grain and pure
water, he made several hundred barrels of whiskey a year, and after
five to ten years of ripening, it was sent out with the makers' brand
upon it. Now the North American of Philadelphia, one of our leading
dailies says, rectifiers (and I would prefix one letter and make it
w-r-e-c-k-t-i-f-i-e-r-s) take one barrel from the distillery and by a
pernicious, poisonous process, make one hundred barrels from one
barrel.

It is true the sting of the adder and the bite of the serpent were in
the old-time whiskey, but it was as pure as it could be made. Doctor
Wiley, Ex-Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, says: "Eighty-five per
cent. of all the whiskey sold in the saloons, hotels and club-rooms is
not whiskey at all but a cheap base imitation." In the different
concoctions made are found aconite, acquiamonia, angelica root,
arsenic, alum, benzine, belladonna, beet-root juice, bitter almond,
coculus-indicus, sulphuric acid, prussic acid, wood alcohol, boot
soles and tobacco stems. No wonder we have more murders in this
republic than in any civilized land beneath the sky in proportion to
population.

Along with this adulteration of the drink has gone the degeneracy of
the saloon and the seller. The day was when officers in churches could
sell liquor and retain their membership. Today the saloonkeeper is
barred from the protestant churches, barred from Masons, Odd Fellows,
Knights of Pythias, Red Men, Woodmen, Maccabees and nearly every other
fraternal organization of the world.

The saloon itself has become such a vicious resort, that when the
police look for a murderer they go to the saloon. When any vile
character is sought for, the saloon is searched. When anarchists meet
to plan for a Hay-market murder in Chicago, they meet in the saloon.
When an assassin plans to shoot down our President at an exposition,
he goes from the saloon. When a fire breaks out in Chicago or Boston
the first order is, close the saloons. Don't close any other business
house, but close the saloon. If a mob threatens Pittsburg, Cincinnati,
or Atlanta, close the saloons. If an earthquake strikes San Francisco,
close the saloons. In our large cities gambling rooms are attached to
the saloons with wine rooms above for women, and while our boys are
being ruined downstairs, girls are destroyed upstairs.

There are many thousands of women in painted shame, who would now be
safe inside life's Eden of purity but for the saloon. The South Side
Club of Chicago said in 1914: "The back rooms of four hundred and
forty-five saloons on only three streets of this city contribute to
the delinquency of fourteen thousand girls every twenty-four hours."
Is it any wonder the saloons hide behind green blinds or stained glass
windows?

There is a fish in the sea known as the "Devil Fish." It lies on its
back with open mouth and covers itself with sea moss. Over its open
mouth is a bait. When an unsuspecting fish nibbles at the bait, with a
quick snap it is caught and devoured. Do you see any analogy between
this fish and a certain business that hides itself behind painted
windows or green blinds and hangs out a bait of "free lunch" or
"Turtle Soup"? A fish that sets a trap for its kind is called a "Devil
Fish;" a business that does the like is recognized as a legitimate
trade and permitted for the sake of revenue.

Every other recognized business has improved in quality with the
years. The saloon has grown worse and worse, until it is bad and only
bad; bad in the beginning, bad in the middle, bad in the end, bad
inside, outside, upside, downside. It is so bad, the liquor dealers
are the only business men who are ashamed to put on exhibition their
finished products. In great expositions other trades present finished
wares. They do not display the tools used in making what they present
for exhibition but the finished goods. Not so with the liquor dealers;
they put on exhibition the tools with which they work, but not a
single specimen of the finished product of their trade do they present
for inspection.

"That's a fine fit of clothes you have, sir." "Yes," says the tailor,
"I put up that job; glad you like my work."

"That's a fine building across the way." "Yes," says the architect,
"that's my job and I am quite proud of it."

"That's a handsome bonnet you wear, madam." "Yes," says the milliner,
"that's my creation of style and I am rather proud of my work."

Yonder is a man intoxicated. He staggers and falls; his head strikes
the curb-stone; the blood besmears his face; the police lift him up
and start with him to the station house. Did you hear a saloon keeper
say: "That's my creation; I put up that job and I'm proud of my work."

Some one said recently in defense of the business: "The saloon keeper
deserves more consideration." This writer should know that
consideration has been the source of its undoing. Lord Chesterfield
considered it and said: "Drink sellers are artists in human
slaughter." Senator Morrill, of Maine, considered and pronounced it
"the gigantic crime of all crimes." Senator Long, of Massachusetts
considered it and called it "the dynamite of modern civilization."
Henry W. Grady, our brilliant southerner, considered it and said: "It
is the destroyer of men, the terror of women and the shadow on the
face of childhood. It has dug more graves and sent more souls to
judgment than all the pestilences since Egypt's plague, or all the
wars since Joshua stood before the walls of Jericho." The New York
Tribune considered it and said: "It's the clog upon the wheels of
American progress." The Bible considered it and compares its influence
to the bite of serpents, the sting of adders, the poison of asps, and
heaps the woes of God's will upon it.

Sam Jones said: "When the Bible says _woe_, you better stop," and as
certain as seed time brings harvest it will stop, not because of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union, or the Anti-Saloon League, or the
Prohibition Party, but because afar back in the blue haze of the past
the seed of prohibition was planted in the soil of Divine truth.

Ever since God declared woe against the evils of mankind, the
batteries of the holy Bible have been trained upon the "wine that
gives its color in the cup," and the man who "giveth his neighbor
drink and maketh him drunken also."

It _will_ stop, because error cannot stand agitation. Whoever espouses
the cause of error must evade facts, falsify figures, libel logic,
tangle his tongue or pen with contradictions and wind up in confusion.

The able editor of the Courier Journal of Kentucky came to the defense
of this error, and with all his brilliancy and culture, he resorted to
personal abuse of temperance workers, _because he could not occupy a
higher plane in defense of the saloon_. He made up what he called an
"ominum gatherum," of "bigots," "hay-seed politicians," "fake
philosophers," "cranks," "scamps," "professional sharps," "mad caps of
destruction," "preachers who would sell corner lots in heaven," "a
riff-raff of moral idiots and red-nosed angels."

I could hardly believe my own eyes when I read this frantic phillipic
from one I had esteemed so highly for his intellect; one whose element
is up where eagles soar, and not down where baser birds feast upon
rotten spots in a world of beauty. Only a few days before I had read
his beautiful tribute to Lincoln, delivered at the unveiling in
Hodgenville, in which he said of the great emancipator: "He never lost
his balance or tore a passion to tatters," yet the finished orator who
paid the tribute, when he espouses the cause of error, flies into a
paroxysm of passion and tears the dignity of his own self-control into
shreds.

Knowing as I do the culture, refinement and polished manners of the
great journalist, I wondered what aggravating force could have so
unbalanced his mental scales and led him to so bitterly denounce
those, whose only offense is, trying to do what Lincoln did, abolish
an evil. If this resourceful writer were only converted to the truth
on this question, what an "ominum gatherum" he could make from the
work of the saloon curse.

The clergymen, called "canting, diabolical preachers," deserve more
respectful consideration from one who well knows their sincerity. They
are men of brains, heart and conscience; men who believe that
righteousness rather than revenue exalts a nation, and that sin, no
matter how much money invested in it, is a reproach to any people.
These ministers believe it to be morally wrong to convert God's golden
grain into what debases mankind. They preach that what is morally
wrong can never be made politically right. With them it is a matter of
deep, permanent conviction. Such attacks are made to divert attention
from the accused at the bar of public opinion.

It is the saloon that is on trial, not cranks, or moral idiots, or
ministers. The saloon is charged with being the enemy of every virtue
and ally of every vice, that it injures public health, public peace
and public morals. The Supreme Court says: "No legislature has the
right to barter away public health, public peace or the public morals;
the people themselves cannot do so, much less their servants."

In face of this declaration of the Supreme Court, legislators do
barter away public health, public peace and public morals to the
organized liquor traffic. All along the cruel career of this enemy of
peace, health and morals, it has been pampered and petted by
politicians who have been as much charmed by its promise of votes, as
was Eve in the Garden of Eden by the serpent's assurance. Deceived by
the serpent of the still, they have not only disregarded the decision
of the Supreme Court but defied God's plan of dealing with sin. They
have persisted in trying to regulate an irregularity in morals by
licensing the greatest sin of the century, and have done so to their
shame and failure in any regulation effort ever made. The only way to
cure chills is to kill the malaria. The only way to cure the cursed
liquor traffic is to cast it out of our civilization by a universal,
everlasting prohibition of the manufacture, importation and sale of
intoxicating liquor.

Rev. Howard Crosby, of New York, in advocating high license as a means
of reducing the number of saloons, said in an address: "Suppose a
tiger were to get loose in the city, would you not confine him to a
few blocks rather than let him roam the city at large?" Some one in
the audience answered aloud: "No Doctor, we would kill the tiger."

How does regulation regulate? Take the city of Louisville, Ky., where
I resided a number of years, and where I observed the practical
working of the license system. Go there any Monday morning and you
will see from twenty to forty men and women in the cage next to the
Police Court room. A marshal stands at the door of the cage and takes
them out one at a time. You will hear the judge say: "ten dollars and
cost," which means thirty days in the workhouse. Forty days pass and
here is the same man in the Police Court: thirty days to serve his
time, ten days to get a little money and then another drunk. Some do
not know how many times they have been before the court. I was there
one day when an Irishman was arraigned. The Judge said: "Pat, how many
times have you been before this court?"

"Faith, and your books will tell ye," replied the Irishman. Judge
Price, the police judge at the time, said to me: "There are a number
of men, and several women I know in this city, who pass through the
courtroom on their way to the workhouse so regularly, I can guess
within a few days of the time they will appear." They pass like
buckets at a fire, going up full and returning empty.

There is an asylum in this country where, I am told, they test a man's
insanity in this way. They have a trough which holds one hundred
gallons of water. Above is an open tap through which the water pours
constantly, and of course the trough keeps on running over. The
patient is brought to the trough, given a bucket and told to dip out
the water. If he dips all day and has not mind enough to turn off the
tap, he is considered a very serious case. If this test were put to
our license lawmakers, I fear they would have to go to the incurable
ward. They have for many years been picking up drunkards from the
gutters and opening taps for them to keep on pouring into the streets.
Under this system the saloon keepers are playing ten-pins. You know in
playing ten-pins there is a long alley, at one end of which stand the
pins, while at the other stands the player with a ball in his hand. He
rolls the ball down the alley and knocks down the pins. Some one sets
them up, and to that some one, who is often a boy, the player will
toss a dime and say: "set them up quick." Does he let them stand? No!
he rolls the ball down the alley and down go the pins. The saloon
keeper has the ball of law in his hands. No matter whether a high or
low license ball, he paid the price for the use of the ball. When
temperance workers set up drunkards and they get a little money in
their pockets away goes the ball and they are down again. When a
church revival picks up a few drunkards the saloon keeper will say:
"Here's a dollar to help in your meeting." Then in his mind he says:
"Set up the drunkards who are out of employment and money, get them
positions, and when they can earn money again, again I'll bowl them
down." Under the license system the saloon is playing ten-pins with
temperance associations, ten-pins with the church and ten-pins with
society. I have faith to believe the time is drawing near when the
balls will be confiscated and the pins can stand when we do set them
up.

I know many have not this faith because they believe prohibitory laws
are failures. They base their belief on the violation of the law. By
that rule everything is a failure. Married life is a failure; its laws
are grossly violated. Home life is a failure; there are many miserable
homes. The school is a failure; many a father has put thousands of
dollars into the education of his son and found it wasted in riotous
living. The church is a failure; many of its members are Christians
only in name and not a few are hypocrites. Same as during London's
Air-raids, but less danger.

At the conclusion of the Tour patrons will be presented with a
Handsome Medal as a souvenir of their exploits.

VISITORS.

When I was very ill in bed The fairies came to visit me; They danced
and played around my head, Though other people couldn't see.

Across the end a railing goes With bars and balls and twisted rings,
And there they jiggled on their toes And did the wonderfullest
things.

They balanced on the golden balls, They jumped about from bar to bar,
And then they fluttered to the walls Where coloured birds and roses
are.

I watched them darting in and out, I watched them gaily climb and
cling, While all the roses moved about And all the birds began to
sing.

And when it was no longer light I felt them up my pillows creep, And
there they sat and sang all night-- I heard them singing in
my sleep.

THE MUD LARKS.

The Babe went to England on leave. Not that this was any new experience
for him; he usually pulled it off about once a quarter--influence, and
that sort of thing, you know. He went down to the coast in a carriage
containing seventeen other men, but he got a fat sleepy youth to sit
on, and was passably comfortable. He crossed over in a wobbly
boat packed from cellar to attic with Red Tabs invalided with shell
shock, Blue Tabs with trench fever, and Green Tabs with brain-fag;
Mechanical Transporters in spurs and stocks, jam merchants in
revolvers and bowie-knives, Military Police festooned with
_pickelhaubes_, and here and there a furtive fighting man who had
got away by mistake, and would be recalled as soon as he landed.

The leave train rolled into Victoria late in the afternoon. Cab touts
buzzed about the Babe, but he would have none of them; he would go
afoot the better to see the sights of the village--a leisurely
sentimental pilgrimage. He had not covered one hundred yards when a
ducky little thing pranced up to him, squeaking, "Where are your
gloves, Sir?"

"I always put 'em in cold storage during summer along with my muff and
boa, dear," the Babe replied pleasantly. "Moreover, my mother doesn't
like me to talk to strangers in the streets, so ta-ta." The little
creature blushed like a tea-rose and stamped its little hoof. "Insolence!"
it squeaked. "You--you go back to France by the next boat!" and the
Babe perceived to his horror that he had been witty to an Assistant
Provost-Marshal!

He flung himself down on his knees, licking the A.P.M.'s boots
and crying in a loud voice that he would be good and never do it
again.

The A.P.M. pardoned the Babe (he wanted to save the polish on his boots)
on condition that he immediately purchased a pair of gloves of
the official cut and hue. The Babe did so forthwith and continued
on his way. He had not continued ten yards when another A.P.M.
tripped him up. "That cap is a disgrace, Sir!" he barked. "I know it,
Sir," the Babe admitted, "and I'm awfully sorry about it; but that
hole in it only arrived last night--shrapnel, you know--and I haven't
had time to buy another yet. I don't care for the style they sell in
those little French shops--do you?"
The A.P.M. didn't know anything about France or its little shops,
and didn't intend to investigate; at any rate not while there was
a war on there.

  "You will return to the Front
  to-morrow," said he. The Babe
  grasped his hand from him and shook
  it warmly.

"Thank you--thank you, Sir," he gushed; "I didn't want to come, but
they made me. I'm from Fiji; have no friends here, and London is
somehow so different from Suva it makes my head ache. I am broke and
couldn't afford leave, anyway. Thank you, Sir--thank you."
"Ahem--in that case I will revoke my decision," said the A.P.M.

"Buy yourself an officially-sanctioned cap and carry on."
The Babe bought one with alacrity; then, having tasted enough of the
dangers of the streets for one afternoon, took a taxi, and, lying
in the bottom well out of sight, sped to his old hotel. When he reached
his old hotel he found it had changed during his absence, and was now
headquarters of the Director of Bones and Dripping.

He abused the taxi-driver, who said he was sorry, but there was no telling
these days; a hotel was a hotel one moment, and the next it was
something entirely different.

Motion pictures weren't in it, he said.

Finally they discovered a hotel which was still behaving as such, and
the Babe got a room. He remained in that room all the evening,
beneath the bed, having his meals pushed in to him under the door. A
prowling A.P.M. sniffed at the keyhole but did not investigate
further, which was fortunate for the Babe, who had no regulation
pyjamas.

Next morning, crouched on the bottom boards of another taxi, he was taken
to his tailor, poured himself into the faithful fellow's hands, and
only departed when guaranteed to be absolutely A.P.M.-proof.

He went to the "Bolero" for lunch, ordered some oysters for a start,
polished them off and bade the waiter trot up the _consommé_. The
waiter shook his head, "Can't be done, Sir. Subaltern gents are
only allowed three and sixpenceworth of food and you've already had
that, Sir. If we was to serve you with a crumb more, we'd be
persecuted under the Trading with the Enemy Act, Sir. There's an
A.P.M. sitting in the corner this very moment, Sir, his eyeglass
fixed on your every mouthful very suspicious-like--"
"Good Lord!" said the Babe, and bolted. He bolted as far as the
next restaurant, had a three-and-sixpenny _entrée_ there, went on
to another for sweets, and yet another for coffee and trimmings.
These short bursts between courses kept his appetite wonderfully
alive.
That afternoon he ran across a lady friend in Bond Street, "a War
Toiler enormously interested in the War" (see the current number
of _Social Snaps_). She had been at Yvonne's trying on her gauze
for the Boccaccio Tableaux in aid of the Armenians and needed some
relaxation.
So she engaged the Babe for the play, to be followed by supper with
herself and her civilian husband. The play (a War-drama) gave the
Babe a fine hunger, but the Commissionaire (apparently a Major-General)
who does odd jobs outside the Blitz took exception to him. "Can't
go in, Sir." "Why not?" the Babe inquired; "my friends have gone
in." "Yessir, but no hofficers are allowed to obtain nourishment
after 10 p.m. under Defence of the Realm Act, footnote (a) to para.
14004." He leaned forward and whispered behind his glove, "There's
a Hay Pee Hem under the portico watching your movements, Sir." The
Babe needed no further warning; he dived into his friends' Limousine
and burrowed under the rug.

* * * * *
Sometime later the door of the car was opened cautiously and the
moon-face of the Major-General inserted itself through the crack.
"Hall clear for the moment, Sir; the Hay Pee Hem 'as gorn orf dahn
the street, chasin' a young hofficer in low shoes. 'Ere, tyke this;
I'm a hold soldier meself." He thrust a damp banana in the Babe's
hand and closed the door softly.
Next morning the Babe dug up an old suit of 1914 "civies" and put
them on. A woman in the Tube called him "Cuthbert" and informed him
gratuitously that her husband, twice the Babe's age, had volunteered
the moment Conscription was declared and had been fighting bravely
in the Army Clothing Department ever since. Further she supposed
the Babe's father was in Parliament and that he was a Conscientious
Objector. In Hyde Park one urchin addressed him as "Daddy" and asked
him what he was doing in the Great War; another gambolled round and
round him making noises like a rabbit. In Knightsbridge a Military
Policeman wanted to arrest him as a deserter. The Babe hailed a
taxi and, cowering on the floor, fled back to his hotel and changed
into uniform again.
That night, strolling homewards in the dark immersed in thought,
he inadvertently took a pipe out of his pocket and lit it. An A.P.M.
who had been sleuthing him for half-a-mile leapt upon him, snatched
the pipe and two or three teeth out of his mouth and returned him
to France by the next boat.

* * * * *
His groom, beaming welcome, met him at the railhead with the
horses.
"Hello, old thing, cheerio and all the rest of it," Huntsman whinnied
lovingly.
Miss Muffet rubbed her velvet muzzle against his pocket. "Brought
a lump of sugar for a little girl?" she rumbled.
He mounted her and headed across country, Miss Muffet pig-jumping
and capering to show what excellent spirits she enjoyed.
Two brigades of infantry were under canvas in Mud Gully, their cook
fires winking like red eyes. The guards clicked to attention and
slapped their butts as the Babe went by. A subaltern bobbed out of
a tent and shouted to him to stop to tea. "We've got cake," he
lured, but the Babe went on.
A red-hat cantered across the stubble before him waving a friendly
crop, "Pip" Vibart the A.P.M. homing to H.Q. "Evening, boy!" he
holloaed; "come up and Bridge to-morrow night," and swept on over
the hillside. A flight of aeroplanes, like flies in the amber of
sunset, droned overhead _en route_ for Hunland. The Babe waved his
official cap at them: "Good hunting, old dears."
They had just started feeding up in the regimental lines when he
arrived; the excited neighing of five hundred horses was music to
his ears. His brother subalterns hailed his return with loud and
exuberant noises, made disparaging remarks about the smartness of
his clothes, sat on him all over the floor and rumpled him. On
sighting the Babe, The O'Murphy went mad and careered round the
table wriggling like an Oriental dancer, uttering shrill yelps of
delight; presently he bounced out of the window, to enter some
minutes later by the same route, and lay the offering of a freshly
slain rat at his best beloved's feet.
At this moment the skipper came in plastered thick with the mud of
the line, nodded cheerfully to his junior sub and instantaneously
fell upon the buttered toast.
"Have a good time, Son?" he mumbled. "How's merrie England?"
"Oh, England's all right, Sir," said the Babe, tickling The O'Murphy's
upturned tummy--"quite all right; but it's jolly to be home again
among one's ain folk." 
PATLANDERSoon we'll see the land of promise, and the Ship of
State will be saved from a leak as dangerous as ever sprung in a
vessel, and from as cruel a crew of buccaneers as ever scuttled a
ship.

When I began the work as a "Good Templar" forty years ago, Kentucky
was soaked in rum. Bourbon county, where I was reared, had
twenty-three distilleries, and a dead wall lifted itself against my
hopes of ever seeing the sky clear of distillery smoke above old
Bourbon county, a name on more barrels and bottles, on more bar-room
windows, and on the memories of more drunkards in ruin than any other
county in the world. Yet I have lived to see the last distillery fire
go out, and Bourbon county dry. While I had faith in the ultimate
triumph of the Cause I never dreamt it would come to Bourbon county in
my lifetime.

When I began saloons were at almost every crossroads village, and the
bottle on sideboards was the rule in thousands of leading homes. Time
and again my life was threatened. On one occasion twelve armed men
guarded me from a mob, and once my wife placed herself between my body
and a desperate mountaineer. Those were perilous times for an advocate
of temperance in my native state. Now out of one hundred and twenty
counties, one hundred and seven are dry. In Georgia the licensed
saloon is gone; in North Carolina the saloon is gone; in West
Virginia, Old Virginia, Mississippi and Tennessee the saloon is gone,
while Oklahoma was born sober.

  "That which made Milwaukee famous
    Doesn't foam in Tennessee;
  The Sunday lid in old Missouri
    Was Governor Folk's decree.
  Brewers, distillers and their cronies
    Well may sigh;
  The saloon is panic-stricken,
    And the South's going dry.

  "Soon the hill-side by the rill-side
    Of Kentucky will be still;
  Men will take their toddies
    From the ripples of the rill;
  Boys will grow up sober,
    Mothers cease to cry;
  Glory hallelujah!
    The South's going dry."

Already seventeen states are dry, and there are many arid spots in the
wet states. While I cannot hope to live to see the final triumph, I
have faith to believe my children and my children's children will live
in a saloonless land, a land redeemed from a curse that has soaked its
social life in more blood and tears than all other sources of sorrow;
a land where liberty will no longer be shorn of its locks of strength
by licensed Delilahs; where manhood will no more be stripped of its
possibilities by the claws of the demon drink; where fore-doomed
generations will not reach the dawning of life's morning, to be bound
like Mazeppa to the wild, mad steed of passion and borne down the
blood lines of inheritance to the awful abuse of drunkenness.

To this end I appeal to every minister of the gospel, stir the
consciences of your hearers on this question. I appeal to the press,
that potent power for the enlightenment of the people.

  "Pulpit and press with tongue and pen,
  Set to new music this message to men:
  Let the great work of destruction begin,
  And rid our loved land of this shelter to sin.
  As before the sun's brightness, the darkness must fly,
  So by power of the ballot the rum curse must die,
  Then cover the earth as the wide waves the sea,
  With the sound of the axe at the root of the tree!"


VIII

IF I COULD LIVE LIFE OVER.


Now and then I hear an old man or an old woman say, "Even if I could I
would not live life over." Well, I own I would, provided I could begin
the journey with the knowledge I now have of what it means to live.

While mistakes have been many there are some things I would not
change. I would be brought up in the country as I was. I would play
over the same blue-grass carpet, along the same turnpike aisle, swing
on the branches of the same old trees and listen to the concert chorus
of the same song birds.

Indeed I sympathize with the boy who exchanges the music of birds,
melody of streams, lowing of herds, driving of teams, diamond dew on
bending blade, morning sun and evening shade, with all other sweet
associations of country life for a lodging room in a city, where
church doors and home doors are closed against him in the evening
hours of the week, and all evil places wide open for his ruin. It has
been well said: "The street fair of evil associations in our large
cities begins with the night shadows and grows with the darkness." I
dare say if I could draw aside the veil that will shut in the night
scenes of this city, the revelation would make some godly fathers
tremble for their boys, and pious mothers long to gather their
children about them when the sun goes down, as moor birds gather their
helpless young when hawks are screaming in the sky.

All hail to the Young Men's Christian Association, with its open doors
for young men in the evening hours! All hail to its gymnasium, its
swimming pool, basketball and other sports that develop strength and
furnish entertainment! Away with the idea that all the pleasures of
the world belong to the devil.

A distinguished divine was brought up in New England by a staid old
aunt, who never let him go anywhere except to church, Sunday school
and prayer meeting. When quite a lad she let him go to New York City
to visit a cousin. That cousin took him to see Barnum's circus. It was
his first circus, and the wild animals, the bareback riding, trapeze
performance, clowns and chariot races bewildered the country boy. Next
morning he wrote his aunt, saying: "Dear Aunt, if you'll go to one
circus you'll never go to another prayer meeting as long as you live."
But he did go to prayer meeting and became a grand good man. There are
many innocent springs of pleasure, where youth can drink and not be
harmed.

It may surprise some for me to say, if I could live life over I would
be brought up in the same old state of Kentucky. "With all her faults
I love her still," _but not her stills_. It has been my privilege to
visit every state in the union and I find all the good is not in any
one state, nor all the bad. While Kentucky has had her night riders,
Missouri has had her boodlers, California her grafters, Illinois her
anarchists, Pennsylvania her machine politics, New York her Tammany
tiger, and Washington City her blizzards on inauguration days. God
doesn't grow all the daisies in one field nor confine thorns to one
thicket.

  It's been my lot this land to roam,
  O'er every state twixt ocean's foam,
  But still my heart clings to its home,
          Kentucky.

  I've traveled the prairies of the west,
  I've seen each section at its best,
  There's nothing like my native nest,
          Kentucky.

  No matter through what state I pass,
  No matter how the people class,
  To me there's only one Blue Grass,
          Kentucky.

  When my wanderings here are o'er,
  And my spirit seeks the golden shore,
  Then keep my dust for evermore,
          Kentucky.

Not only would I be brought up in Kentucky and in the country, but I
would go to the same Yankee schoolmaster, have the same sweethearts
and marry the same girl, provided she would consent to make another
journey with the same companion. By the way, we were married in
Bourbon County, Kentucky, when she was nineteen and I twenty. About
four years ago we celebrated our golden wedding, and the morning after
the celebration,

  She put on "her old grey bonnet,
  With the blue ribbon on it."
  We didn't "hitch Dobbin to the Shay"
  But along the interurban
  We rode down to Bourbon,
  Where we started for our golden wedding day.

If I could live life over surely I could ask no better age than the
one in which I have lived. We no longer toil over a mountain, but
glide through it on ribbons of steel; telegraphy dives the deep and
brings us the news of the old world every morning before breakfast; we
talk with tongues of lightning through telephones and send messages on
ether waves over the sea; we ride horse-cycles that run, never walk
and live without eating; we travel in carriages drawn by electric
steeds that never tire; the signal service gives us a geography of the
weather, so the farmer may know whether or not to prepare to plow, and
the Sunday school whether to arrange or to postpone its picnic
tomorrow; airships mount the heavens, steamships plough the ocean's
bosom, submarine torpedo boats undermine the deep with missiles of
death, while photography turns one inside out, and doctors no longer
guess at the location of a bullet. All these things have come to pass
within my life-time. What may the young before me expect in the next
fifty years?

Recently I read an imaginary letter, supposed to have been written by
a Wellsley College girl. It was dated one hundred years in the future.
She wrote:

"Father gave me a new airship a few weeks ago. I leave my home in
Baltimore every morning after breakfast and reach Wellsley in time for
classes. We have only thirty minutes in school in the morning and
fifteen in the afternoon. Our teachers are in telepathic touch with
all knowledge and we get it in condensed form. A few days ago, just
after lunch at noon I took a spin up into Canada; the machine got a
little out of fix, so I jumped on a gyroscope and returned in time for
dinner at six.

"Yesterday I sailed over to New York City and took dinner at the
Waldorf-Astoria; had two capsules for dinner and they were delicious.
I read how the people used to sit around tables and eat all kinds of
things. It must have been funny to see their mouths all going at one
time. Then they had stomach trouble--indigestion they called it. Now
we have everything necessary for the human system put up in capsules;
we get up a thousand feet above the earth where the air is pure, so we
ought to live to be two hundred years old.

"Last week my classmate and I took a flying trip to see the Panama
Canal, and while there we decided to take in the Exposition at San
Francisco next day. There we saw many antiquated machines called
automobiles; they used to run around the streets in rubber stockings,
honking horns to warn the poor, then turning turtle they killed or
maimed the rich. In one department we saw an animal with long tail,
and a mane on its neck. They called it a horse and told us that years
ago horses were harnessed and driven about the streets, while the fast
ones were raced for money."

That young woman may be all right about her capsule dinners and
condensed instruction, but one hundred years from now, when on her way
from the west to Wellsley if she will stop in Lexington, Ky., she will
see a horse sale in progress; horses selling from five hundred to ten
thousand dollars that will trot or pace a mile in less than two
minutes, while slow ones will be hitched to dead wagons, used to
gather up those who have fallen from airships and gyroscopes. It may
be that one hundred years in the future airships will be seen soaring
over the cities, delivering packages in parachutes at the back doors
of residences, but the day will never dawn when there will be an
airship, gyroscope, or an automobile that will supplant the
fleet-footed, sleek-coated, handsome Kentucky horse.

Now I come to the more practical, for I do not bring you this talk,
challenging your criticism or inviting your praise of it as a literary
production, but with the purpose of helping some one live as I would
wish to live if I had my life to live over.

First, to the boys before me. If I had life to live over one of my
first purposes would be to seek my calling in life. Do you know half
the failures of life come from misfits of occupation? There are
lawyers starving for want of clients, doctors with patients under
monuments, and preachers talking to empty pews, who might have been
successful in factories or furrows. Cowper was a failure as a lawyer,
he was a success as a poet; Goldsmith was a bungling surgeon, he was a
power with his pen; Horace Greely was a success in the Tribune office,
he was a failure as a farmer and a slow candidate for president.

When U.S. Grant was a very young man his father sent him to sell a
horse to a buyer and instructed him to ask one hundred dollars, but if
he could not get that amount to take eighty-five. The buyer looked the
horse over and said: "Young man, what is your price?" Young Grant
replied: "Father told me to ask you one hundred dollars, but if you
would not give that to take eighty-five." It is needless to say the
calling of U.S. Grant was not horse trading. This same young man
afterwards tried the grocery business and bought potatoes far and wide
to corner the market, but the price went down, the potatoes rotted in
Grant's bins and his grocery effort was on a par with his horse
trading. He then tried the ice market but that became watered stock on
his hands and again he was a failure. Later on in life 'mid roar of
cannon and rattle of musketry the misfit found his element. Here he
was so sure of his calling he made his motto, "I'll fight it out on
this line if it takes all summer," and to the general, who could not
drive a horse trade, or corner the potato market, or deal in ice, one
of the greatest generals the world ever knew surrendered his sword,
and from the highest military position Grant was called to be
President of the United States.

If it is true that "ever since creation shot its first shuttle through
chaos design has marked the course of every golden thread," then every
human being is designed to fill a certain place in life. There are
young women teaching school, getting to be old maids, who should be
the wives of good husbands, and there are some wives who ought to be
old maid "schoolmarms."

We have born architects, born orators, born bookkeepers, born
musicians, born poets, born preachers, born teachers, born surgeons,
born bankers, born blacksmiths, born merchants, born farmers.

Two farmers live side by side; one doesn't seem to work hard, yet
everything is neatness from one end of the farm to the other; his
neighbor works hard, yet the cattle are in his corn, the fences are
broken, gates off the hinges and everything seems out of order. That
man was not made to be a farmer. He should rent out, or sell out, and
go to the legislature, or find some other place he can fill.

Matthew Arnold said: "Better be a Napoleon of book-blacks, or an
Alexander of chimney-sweeps, than an attorney, who, like necessity,
knows no law." There are born shoemakers cobbling in Congress, while
statesmen are pegging away on a shoe-last because their brains have
not been capitalized by education and opportunity. There are born
preachers at work in machine shops, and born mechanics rattling around
in pulpits like a mustard seed in an empty gourd; born surgeons are
carving beef in butcher stalls, while here and there butchers are
operating for appendicitis.

God planted the hardy pine on the hills of New England, and the
magnolia down in the sunny South-land. Let some horticulturist compel
the magnolia to climb the cold hills of New England, and the northern
tree to come down and take its place in the "land of cotton, cinnamon
seed and sandy bottom," and everything in both will protest against
the mistake.

Lowell said: "Every baby boy is born with a calling." With some this
calling is very definite. It was definite with George Stevenson when
in childhood he made engines of mud with sticks for smoke-stacks. It
was definite with Thomas A. Edison, who, instead of selling
newspapers, went to experimenting with acids, and charged a steel
stirrup that lifted him into the electric saddle of the world. With
others it is very indefinite. Patrick Henry failed at everything he
undertook until he began talking, when he soon became the golden
mouthed orator of his age. Peter Cooper failed until he took to making
glue, then his business "stuck" to everybody and he made a fortune out
of which he built Cooper Union for the education of poor boys.

I have a grandson whose calling was indefinite. He was named for his
grandfather, to whom fishing is a fad. During my rest season I go
fishing almost every day. While I make an exception of Sunday I can
appreciate the minister who was a great fisherman. On his way to an
appointment Sunday morning he came upon a lad fishing in a wayside
stream. Halting he said: "My boy, this is the Sabbath day and the good
Book says you should remember to keep it holy." Just then a fish
seized the boy's bait and drew the float under, when the good minister
excitedly said: "Pull, pull. Ah! that's a good one. I'll try that
place myself _some other day_."

Fishing is my favorite sport. My grandson was a baseball fiend and a
football player. He was hurt in a football game and I wrote him,
warning him against his recklessness, and to the admonition I added:
"Twenty-five boys have been killed already this season playing
football; it's a brutal game anyway."

He replied: "Dear Grandfather, I am sorry so many boys have been
killed playing football, but I read recently that last summer two
hundred and fifty men were drowned while out fishing; would it not be
well for you to keep off Lake Ellerslie? You say football is a brutal
game; I submit to you, Grandpa, that the man who takes an innocent
worm or a minnow, strings it on a steel hook, and sinking it into the
water, jerks the gills out of an innocent fish, is more cruel than the
boy who kicks another around for exercise. I need a pair of baseball
shoes, number six and a half; send them by express." He got the shoes,
and I decided _he_ was called to be a lawyer.

Young man, if you get to be a preacher and cannot put force into your
sermon, the world doesn't want to hear you preach, but if you are a
good cobbler it will wear your shoes, if a good baker it will eat your
bread, or if a good barber it will let you put your razor to its
throat. Remember in making your choice,

  "Honor and fame from no condition rise,
  Act well your part; there the honor lies."

If I could live life over, I would not be content with a common school
education. In my youth circumstances lifted a dead wall against my
hopes, but if given another chance I would somehow press my way to
where higher education scatters its trophies at the feet of youth, for
while it is true some of the most successful men of our country
graduated from the high school of "hard knocks" and universities of
adversity, yet the humblest toil is more easily accomplished and
better done where college education guides.

To college education, however, I would add the education which comes
from rubbing against the world. Some one has said: "For every ounce of
book knowledge one needs a half dozen ounces of common sense with
which to apply it." Douglas Jerrold said: "I have a friend who can
speak fluently a dozen different languages but has not a practical
idea to express in any one of them."

An old woman suffering from rheumatism was asked by a friend: "Did you
ever try electricity?"

She answered: "Yes, I was struck by lightning once but it didn't do me
any good."

In this many sided age one needs to educate muscle, nerves, heart and
conscience as well as brain. That man who is all brain and no heart,
goes through the world with his intellect shining above his bosom like
an electric light over a graveyard.

Young people, do you know you live in a testing world, a world in
which all buds and blossoms are tested? The bud that stands the test
of wind and frost goes on to flower and fruitage; the bud that can't
stand the test goes with the dust to be trampled under foot. Every
cannon made by the government is tested; the cannon that can stand the
test goes into battleship or land fort, the cannon that can't stand
the test goes into the junk pile.

Yonder in Virginia a few years ago, there was a young man who had
everything an indulgent father could give him, but in school his
character could not stand the test, and he exchanged his books for
wine and cards. He married a beautiful young woman, shot her to death
in his automobile and died himself in the electric chair, leaving his
old father in a desolate home with harrowing memories tearing his
heart; while over the life of an innocent babe he hung a cloud as dark
as was ever woven out of the world's misfortune, and sent another life
to wander in painted shame outside life's eden of purity, the barb of
conscious guilt to be driven deeper and deeper into her soul by the
scorn of a pitiless world. All because young Beatty could not stand
the test!

Harry Thaw had everything wealth and refinement could bring into a
young life, but he sacrificed all upon unhallowed altars, and with the
brand of Cain upon his brow, he was cast into a madman's cell. He
could not stand the test.

Lord Byron was Britain's brilliant bard. He could have lived in
England's glory and then slept with England's buried greatness in
Westminster Abbey, if he had stood the test; but at the age of
thirty-seven, when he should have been on an upward flight to greater
fame, he drew the "strings of his discordant harp" about him and over
them sent the bitter wail:

  "My days are in the yellow leaf;
    The flowers and fruits of love are gone;
  The worm, the canker, and the grief
    Are mine alone!"

Younder in a cabin a babe was born. When eleven years of age he helped
his mother clear out a patch and raise a garden. Later on he lay in
front of a wood fire, studying lessons for the morrow. Later in life
he went to college, with only a few cents in his pocket. He went to
church and there gave part of his little all in a collection for
missionary work. The next Saturday he earned a dollar with a
jack-plane; at the end of his college term he had paid his way and had
seven dollars left. At twenty-eight this young man was in the senate
of his state, at thirty-six he was in Congress, and twenty-seven years
from the time James A. Garfield rang the bell of Hiram College for his
board he went into the White House as President of the United States.
He could stand the test. Boys, can you stand the test?

During the Spanish American war there was a regiment called the "Rough
Riders." It was made up of picked young men from different states of
the Union. It was this regiment that made the famous charge up San
Juan Hill. At the close of the war, the regiment was mustered out of
service. The Colonel, giving his farewell address, said: "You have
made an honorable record in war, now go back to your homes and make
honorable record in peace."

Sixteen years of that record is made. The Colonel has been President
of the United States for seven years of that time. General Leonard
Wood has gone to the front of the army, and others of the regiment
have become successful professional and business men; but some have
gone to jails and penitentiaries, one died not long since in the
streets of New York City and was buried in a pauper's grave; some are
fugitives from justice.

What is true of that regiment, is in some measure true of every body
of young men and boys I meet. In my presence are boys who will be
leaders of thought and action twenty years from now in whatever
community they dwell. There is a boy before me who will be a
successful merchant, there's one who will be a banker, another will be
a lawyer, others will lead in other lines. But alas! in my presence
now, looking me in the face this minute, there may be a boy, or boys,
who will stain with blood the stony path to despair.

Do you say that no such ignominious possibility hangs over any boy in
this audience? I tell you it is not always the first, but sometimes
the fairest born. I know a man who in his youth drove his father's
fine horses, romped and rested on the richest blue-grass lawn, ate
from spotless linen and lived in luxury, who now eats from the bare
tables of low saloons, and is often given shelter by an old colored
"mammy," who was once his father's slave.

I have in mind a schoolmate, whose father lived in a fine country home
two miles from the schoolhouse. The influence of my schoolmate's
mother was pure as the diamond dew he brushed from the bending grass
in barefoot days. But he left the country home and the last time I saw
him he was a vagabond, begging bread from negro cabin doors. Ah!
mother, you can't tell _which_ boy.

In a large city a few years ago a man stood at the side door of a
saloon at two o'clock in the morning. His clothes were worn and the
matted hair hung about his face. He waited, hoping some one would come
along and give him the price of a drink. Two young men, one of them a
reporter on a leading daily, came down the street. As they neared the
poor fellow, one said to the other: "Did you ever see such an appeal
for a drink? Here, hobo, take this dime and buy you one."

Seizing his hand his friend said: "No, let's do the job like good
Samaritans. Come in, tramp, and have a drink with us."

The three entered the saloon, the glasses were filled and the tramp
took his and draining it, said: "Young men, I'm very thirsty, may I
have another?"

"Yes, help yourself," was the reply, and the tramp took the second
drink. Then lifting his hat he said:

"Young men, you call me a hobo, but I see in you a picture of my lost
manhood. Once I had a face as fair as yours, and wore as good clothes
as you have now. I had a home where love lit the flame on the altar,
but I put out the fire and to-night I'm a wanderer without a home. I
had a wife as beautiful as an artist's dream, but I took the pearl of
her love, dropped it in the wine glass, Cleopatra-like I saw it
dissolve and I quaffed it down. I had a sweet child I fondly loved,
and still love, though I have not seen her for twelve years; a young
woman now in her grandfather's home, she is deprived of the heritage
of a father's good name. Young men, I once had aspirations and
ambitions that soared as high as the morning star, but I clipped their
wings, I strangled them and they died. Call me a tramp, do you? I'm a
preacher without a charge, a lawyer without a brief, a husband without
a wife, a father without a child, a man without a friend. I thank you
for the drinks. Go to your homes and on soft beds may you sleep well;
I'll go out and sleep on yonder bench in the night wind. A few more
drinks, a few more drunkard's dreams, and I'll go out into the
moonless, starless night of a hopeless forever."

Oh! how I would like to help some boy in this audience stand on his
two feet and with clear brain, manly muscle, and moral courage fight
and win the battle of life. How it would rejoice my soul if I could,
with earnest appeal, throw about some mother's boy an armor of
celestial atmosphere against which the arrows of evil would beat in
vain, and fall harmless at his feet.

Hear me, boys; never was there a day when character counted for so
much as now; never a day when a young man, equipped with education and
stability of character, filled with energy and ambition, was in such
demand as he is today; while on the other hand, never was there a day
when a young man with bad habits was in so little demand as now. The
industrial world is closing its doors against young men who are not
sober, industrious and competent. Even a saloon-keeper advertised
thus: "Wanted--A man to tend bar, who does not drink intoxicating
liquors." How would this read: "Wanted--A young man to sell shoes, who
goes bare-footed."

Young women, just here I have a question for you. If the railroad
company does not want the drinking man, if the merchant discriminates
against him, and even the saloon-keeper does not want him for
bar-tender, do you want him for a husband? Can you afford to wrap up
your hopes of happiness in him and to him swear away your young life
and love?

Some young woman may say: "If I taboo the drinking man, I may be an
old maid." Then be an old maid, get some "bloom of youth," paint up
and love yourself. John B. Gough said: "You better be laughed at for
not being married, than never to laugh any more because you are
married."

If I could live life over there are some things I would not do. I
would not stop smoking as I did thirty-five years ago, because I never
would begin and therefore would not need to stop. I am not a fanatic
on the question, but I believe every father in my presence, who uses
tobacco, will be glad to have me say that which I will now say to the
boys who are dulling their brains, poisoning their blood and weakening
their hearts by the use of cigarettes.

Boys, I believe a cigar made me tell my first falsehood. When I was
fifteen years of age I felt I must smoke if I ever expected to be a
man. Father smoked, our pastor smoked, and so did almost every man in
our neighborhood. My mother opposed the habit, but I thought mother
did not know what it took to make a man.

I heard her make an engagement to spend a whole day ten miles from
home the following week, and that day I set apart for learning to
smoke cigars. I laid in some fine ones, six for five cents, and when
mother went out the gate on her visit, I started for the barn. In a
shed back of the barn I took out my cigars, determined to learn that
day if it required the six cigars for my graduation. The first cigar
was lighted and with every puff I felt the manhood coming; but in
about five minutes I felt the manhood _going_. Just then my uncle
called: "George, where are you?" When I answered he said: "Come here
and hold this colt while I knock out a blind tooth."

Horsemen before me know some colts have blind teeth and to save the
eyes these must be removed. I staggered to the colt, held the halter
rein and when the tooth was removed my uncle, looking at me, said:
"What's the matter with you? You are pale as death."

"Nothing, only it always did make me sick to see a blind tooth knocked
out of a horse's mouth," I replied.

My uncle said: "You better lie down on the grass until it passes off,"
and I did.

But I kept on after that until I learned to smoke like a man. When
years had passed and I became editor of a paper it seemed to me I
could write better editorials with the smoke curling about my face.

One morning I finished my breakfast before Mrs. Bain had half finished
hers. Lighting my cigar I stood by the fire chatting and smoking until
the stub was all that remained. Then, as was my custom, I walked up to
kiss her good-bye when she said: "Good-bye. But, I would like to ask
you a question. How would you like to have me finish my breakfast
before you are half through yours, light a cigar, smoke it to the
stub, and with tobacco on my lips and breath offer to kiss you good
morning?"

I said: "You don't have to kiss me," and with this I left for my work.
On the way her question seemed to be waiting my answer, and I gave it
in a resolve that she should never again have cause to repeat that
question, and with my resolve went the cigar.

About this time a co-worker joined me in the same resolution, which
helped me to keep mine. After tea that evening Mrs. Bain said: "I did
not know you were so sensitive, or I should not have said what I did."
I did not tell her then of my promise, lest I should fail to keep it.
Thirty-five years have passed and not a single cigar have I had
between my lips since that morning.

Boys, take one five-cent cigar after each meal, add up the nickels for
one year, put the money at interest, next year, and every year do the
same, compounding the interest, and in thirty-five years you will have
thirty-five hundred dollars--the price of a home for your old age.

Interest joined itself to ambition, and begat a jealousy lest the
episcopal sees, which at the reformation had been pillaged by the
nobles, should again be enriched at the expense of that order.

By a most useful and beneficial law, the impropriations had already
been ravished from the great men: competent salaries had been assigned
to the impoverished clergy from the tithes of each parish: and what
remained, the proprietor of the land was empowered to purchase at
a low valuation.[*] The king likewise, warranted by ancient law and
practice, had declared for a general resumption of all crown lands
alienated by his predecessors; and though he took no step towards
the execution of this project, the very pretension to such power
had excited jealousy and discontent.[**]
Notwithstanding the tender regard which Charles bore to the whole
church, he had been able in Scotland to acquire only the affection
of the superior rank among the clergy.

The ministers in general equalled, if not exceeded, the nobility in
their prejudices against the court, against the prelates, and against
episcopal authority.[***] Though the establishment of the hierarchy
might seem advantageous to the inferior clergy, both as it erected
dignities to which all of them might aspire, and as it bestowed a
lustre on the whole body, and allured men of family into it, these
views had no influence on the Scottish ecclesiastics.

In the present disposition of men's minds, there was another
circumstance which drew consideration, and counterbalanced power
and riches, the usual foundations of distinction among men; and
that was the fervor of piety, and the rhetoric, however barbarous,
of religious lectures and discourses.

Checked by the prelates in the license of preaching, the clergy
regarded episcopal jurisdiction both as a tyranny and a
usurpation, and maintained a parity among ecclesiastics to be a
divine privilege, which no human law could alter or infringe.

While such ideas prevailed, the most moderate exercise of authority would
have given disgust; much more, that extensive power which the
king's indulgence encouraged the prelates to assume. The jurisdiction
of presbyteries, synods, and other democratical courts, was in a
manner abolished by the bishops; and the general assembly itself
had not been summoned for several years.[****] A new oath was
arbitrarily imposed on intrants, by which they swore to observe the
articles of Perth, and submit to the liturgy and canons.

And in a word, the whole system of church government, during a course
of thirty years, had been changed by means of the innovations
introduced by James and Charles.

The people, under the influence of the nobility and clergy, could
not fail to partake of the discontents which prevailed among these
two orders; and where real grounds of complaint were wanting, they
greedily laid hold of imaginary ones.

The same horror against Popery with which the English Puritans were
possessed, was observable among the populace in Scotland; and among
these, as being more uncultivated and uncivilized, seemed rather to
be inflamed into a higher degree of ferocity. The genius of religion
which prevailed in the court and among the prelates, was of an opposite
nature; and having some affinity to the Romish worship, led them to
mollify, as much as possible, these severe prejudices, and to speak
of the Catholics in more charitable language, and with more
reconciling expressions.

From this foundation a panic fear of Popery was easily raised; and
every new ceremony or ornament introduced into divine service, was
part of that great mystery of iniquity, which, from the encouragement
of the king and the bishops, was to overspread the nation.[*] The few
innovations which James had made, were considered as preparatives
to this grand design; and the further alterations attempted by Charles,
were represented as a plain declaration of his intentions.
A little later I entered the Hall of Fine Arts and looked upon that
impressive picture entitled, "Breaking Home Ties." The lad is about to
go out from the roof that has sheltered him from babyhood, to be his
own guide in the big wide world. His mother holds his hand as she
looks love into his eyes, and gives him her warnings and blessing; the
father, with his boy's valise in his hand, has turned away with a lump
in his throat, while even the dog seems to be joining in the loving
farewell.

Turning away from that picture, the thought came: Ah! that means more
than Krupp guns. It means the coming of a day when love shall rule and
war shall cease, when reason and righteousness shall be the
arbitrators for differences between nations, when owls and bats will
nest in the portholes of battleships, and each nation will vie with
the other in warring against the kingdoms of want and wickedness.

When a man requested Bishop McIntyre to preach his wife's funeral
sermon, and told him of her many beautiful traits, Bishop McIntyre
said: "Brother, did you ever tell her all these sweet things before
she died?"

Just here Sam Jones would say: "Husbands, go home and kiss your wives.
Tell them they are the dearest, sweetest things on the earth; you may
have to stretch the truth a little, but say it anyway."

A few years ago, just before the Christmas holidays, I wrote my
daughter, saying: "I wish you would find out from your mother what she
would like for a Christmas gift. However, don't tell her I wrote you
to do this. Also suggest something for the grandchildren that I may
bring each some little remembrance that will please them." I closed by
saying:

  "The sands of my life are growing less and less,
    Soon I'll reach the end of my years,
  Then you'll lay me away with tenderness
    And pay me the tribute of tears.

  "Don't carve on my tomb any word of fame,
    Nor a wheel with its missing spokes,
  Simply let the marble tell my name,
    Then add, 'He was good to his folks.'"

Boys and girls, don't speak back to mother. You love her and don't
mean to offend, but it hurts her. She was patient with you in your
infancy; be patient with her in her old age. From her birth she has
been your loyal, loving slave. She will go away and leave you after a
little while, and oh! how you will miss her when she's gone. Deal
gently with her now; speak kindly to her and when she's gone memories
of your love and kindness to mother will come to you like sweet
perfume from wooded blossoms.

Young lady graduate of high school or college, do you realize what
your father has done for you, and the sacrifices he has made that you
might have what he has never had--a diploma? Go, put your fair tender
cheek against the weather-beaten face of your father, print with rosy
lips a kiss of gratitude upon his furrowed brow, and tell him you
appreciate all he has done for you.

I have been talking to you an hour about what I would do if I could
live life over. If I had life to live over would I do any better than
I have done? If I am no better now, than I was five years ago, if I am
to be no better five years hence than I am now, then I would do no
better if I had another trial.

However, I cannot live life over. The sand in the hour-glass is
running low and when gone can never be replaced, and I am not much
struck on old age. It is said to have its compensations, in that the
"aches and asthmas of old age are no worse than the measles, mumps,
whooping-coughs and appendicitis pains of youth." Righteous old age
should be better than youth. The ocean of time with its breakers and
perils face the young, while for the righteous old the storms are
past, and they are

  "Waiting to enter the haven wide,
  See His face, and be satisfied."

I cannot help these grey hairs or the wrinkles on my brow, but I can
keep my heart young, and I _do_. I enjoy the company of old people,
but delight more in associating with the young.

Dr. A.A. Willetts lectured on "Sunshine" sixty years ago. In his
ninetieth year he was still lecturing; had he lectured on shadows he
would doubtless have died many years before, and never been known as
the "Apostle of Sunshine."

Solomon said: "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine." Never lock
the door of your heart against the sunshine of cheerfulness, and
remember it is not the exclusive blessing of youth but blooms in the
heart of any age. With some it seems to be an inheritance. It kisses
some babies in the cradle, and the radiance of that kiss lingers
through three-score years and ten; while others are born cross, live
cross and die cross. A babe of this latter kind came into a home and
kept up its wailing for several days. The little six-year old boy of
the home said: "Mother, did you say little brother came from heaven?"

"Yes, dear; why do you ask?"

"Well, no wonder the angels bounced him," the boy replied.

I know a woman who is forever telling her trials. If you do not listen
to her story you must read it on her countenance. Nearby is another
who has lost her parents; indeed all her near relatives are gone; not
a flower left to bloom on the desert of old age. Yet, she hides her
sorrows beneath the soul's altar of hope and meets the world with a
smile. Doubtless the first woman wonders why she is so slighted and
the company of the other courted. She should know it is for the same
reason that honey-bees and humming birds light on sweet flowers
instead of dry mullien stalks, and mocking-birds and canaries are
caged instead of owls and rain-crows.

Some persons seem to relish the "cold soup of retrospect" and persist
in picking the "bones of regret," without any appetite for the present
or promises of the future. Beside one of these I would place a
happy-hearted soul, who laughs through the window of the eye and on
whose face you can read,

  "Let those who will, repine at fate,
    And droop their heads in sorrow,
  I'll laugh when cares upon me wait,
    I know they'll leave to-morrow.

  "My purse is light, but what of that?
    My heart is light to match it;
  And if I tear my only coat,
    I'll laugh the while I patch it."

I know a millionaire, who controls numerous industries, whose wife
must apply cold cloths to his head at night to induce sleep. I know
another man not so well off in this world's goods, whose wife must
apply the cold water to get him awake. Care is often pillowed in a
palace, while contentment is asleep in a cottage.

At the close of my lecture at a chautauqua several years ago, a
gentleman said to me: "Sir, we live in a very humble cottage in this
town, but there is a big welcome over the door for you and we want you
to take tea with us." I accepted the invitation and soon was seated on
the porch of the small cottage home. While my host was inside getting
a pitcher of ice water, I looked across the way and there was the home
of a railroad king, his wealth numbered by millions, and the grounds
surrounding his home were rich in flower beds, fountains and forest
trees. My host, pouring the water, said: "You see we are very
fortunately situated here. Our little home is inexpensive and our
taxes very light. Our rich neighbor across the way employs three
gardeners to care for those grounds; he pays all the taxes, has all
the care; they do not cost us a cent, yet we sit here on our little
porch and drink in their beauty." There was a philosopher.

John Wanamaker can pay $100,000 for a picture, which he did some years
ago, and hang it on the walls of his mansion home, but you go out in
the country in the springtime, get up in the early morning while the
cattle are still sleeping in the barnyard and the birds silent in the
trees, watch the rich glow of the day god as it comes peeping through
the windows of the morning, then see the birds leave their bowers, the
larks to fly away to the fields, the mocking-bird to sing in the cedar
at the garden gate, the robin to chirp to its mate, and you will see a
picture which will pale that of the merchant prince.

Or go out on a summer evening just after a rain storm, when nature
hangs itself out to dry; when the golden slipper of the god of day
hangs upon the topmost bough of the tallest tree. You will see a
picture no artist's brush can paint. And God does not hang these
pictures on a wall twenty feet by ten, but on the blue tapestry of the
sky for the world's poor to admire "without money and without price."
Abraham Lincoln well said: "God must have loved the common people,
else he wouldn't have made so many of them."

Let me illustrate the two classes of people to which I have referred.
An old man who dwelt in the shadows of life said: "My life has been
one continual drudgery and disappointment; for fifty years I have had
to get up at 5 o'clock every morning while others enjoyed their sleep,
then all day in the harness of oppression I have had to work with bad
luck dogging my footsteps."

His daughter, thinking to cheer him, said, "Father, don't get
discouraged. You have one comfort anyway; it won't be long till the
end of toil will come, when you will have a good long rest in the
grave where no misfortune can reach you."

"I don't know about that," replied the father; "it will be about my
luck for the next morning to be resurrection day and I'll have to be
up at daylight as usual."

Another man, who always looked on the bright side of life, and when
anything went wrong always looked up something good to match it,
happened to lose a fine horse. _Fine Arts._
"The Sheffield trades require and promote the Fine Arts in many
ways.
Chantrey was a carver and gilder here, and many persons in Sheffield
were his first patrons, when he began to model. He was a native of
Norton, where his parents still reside, and his first youthful
employment was that of bringing milk to the town on asses, as is
the present custom.

At present, Mr. Law is an exquisite modeller in wax; and there are
some ladies who copy the best pictures with a degree of taste and
perfection which is astonishing.Look on the bright side of life, remembering that very often,

  "The trouble that makes us fume and fret,
  And the burdens that make us groan and sweat
  Are the things that haven't happened yet."

When our two boys were babies our home was a country cottage and our
land possession one acre. Nearby lived a young man whose father left
him a blue-grass farm. His home was a handsome brick house; he had
servants and drove fine horses. Often when seated on the little porch
of our humble home, he would pass by, when the feet of his horses and
wheels of his fine carriage would dash the dust into our faces. One
evening when he passed I said: "Never mind, Anna, some day we'll live
in a fine house, we'll have servants and horses and we'll be
'somebodies'." I thought money would bring happiness, and the more
money the more happiness.

We now live in a good home, have servants and horse and carriage;
we've traveled several times together from ocean to ocean, yet I have
never seen a train of Pullman palace cars that can compare in memory
with the two trains that used to leave that little cottage home every
evening for dreamland.

  "We want no patched-up peace," says Mr.
    RAMSAY MACDONALD. But if
  the assaults upon pacifist meetings
    continue we feel sure there will be some patched-up peacemongers.

    Have some of you had sorrows you could not harmonize with the logic of
life? Leave them with Him who "notes the sparrow's fall." Some one has
said: "There are angels in the quarries of life only the blasts of
misfortune and chisels of adversity can carve into beauty."

Doctor Theodore Cuyler said: "God washes the eyes of His children with
tears that they may better see His providences."

Doctor Gutherie said: "Because I am seventy, my hair white and crows'
feet around my eyes, they tell me I'm growing old. That's not I,
that's the house in which I live; I'm on the inside; the house may go
to pieces but I shall live on eternally young."

  "This body is my house, it is not I;
    Herein I sojourn, till in some far off sky,
  I lease a fairer dwelling, built to last,
    Till all the carpentry of time is past.

  "When from heaven high, I view this lone star,
    What need I care where these poor timbers are;
  What if these crumbling walls do go back to dust and loam,
    I will have exchanged them for a broader better home.
  This body is my house, it is not I;
  Triumphant in this faith, I shall live and die."

Since I cannot live life over, since the gate at the end of life's
journey swings but one way, and of all the millions who have passed
through, not one but the Crucified Son of God has returned, why should
I select such a subject for a lecture? When one is on a journey he has
never made before it is well to consult one who has traveled the road
and from him learn the things best to be done, and the places to shun.

For more than three-score years and ten I have been making life's
journey, and for more than forty years have been mingling with the
masses and meeting with varied experiences. To those who are climbing
the hill toward the noon of the journey my advice should be of value.

Cape Horn, you will see if you look on your map, is the extreme southerly
point of South America.

  =Copyrighted 1897, By WILLIAM BEVERLEY HARISON.=
    There are so many storms and fogs there, that
  the Horn, as it is called,
    is much dreaded by sailors.
  
Since the invention of steam, all the steamships go through the
Straits of Magellan, and save the passage round the Horn; but there
is not enough wind for sailing vessels in the rocky and narrow
straits, so they still have to take the outside passage."I'm glad there's a place for the redeemed of the race,
    In the Land of Beginning Again,
  Where there'll be no sighing, there'll be no dying,
    And where sorrows that seemed so sore,
  Will vanish away like the night into day,
    And never come back any more."

It is said "if wishes were horses, beggars would ride." It is useless
for me to wish to live life over or expect an extension of many more
years of borrowed time, but I hope yet that along the shortening path
I may open up here and there a spring that will refresh some thirsty
soul and plant a flower that will brighten the path of some weary one.

It is my desire that I may close the life I cannot live over in the
city where it began, surrounded by loved ones in whose lives I have
lived. I can think of no more fitting close to this lecture than to
use a thought borrowed from another, in paying a tribute to my old
Kentucky home:

  On her blue-grass bed in youth
    I rolled and romped and rested;
  At the altars of her church
    I learned in whom I trusted.

  'Tis here my honored parents sleep,
    A dear sweet babe reposes,
  And o'er my darling daughter's grave
    Blossom the summer roses.
