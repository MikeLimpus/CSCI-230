                       The Rover Boys In Business

 or

 The Search for the Missing Bonds

by Arthur M. Winfield, 1915

 (Edward Stratemeyer)


INTRODUCTION

My Dear Boys: This book is a complete story in itself, but forms the
nineteenth volume in a line issued under the general title of "The
Rover Boys Series for Young Americans."

As I have mentioned in several other volumes, this series was started
a number of years ago with the publication of "The Rover Boys at
School," "On the Ocean," and "In the Jungle." I am happy to say the
books were so well liked that they were followed, year after year, by
the publication of "The Rover Boys Out West," "On the Great Lakes,"
"In Camp," "On Land and Sea," "On the River," "On the Plains," "In
Southern Waters," "On the Farm," "On Treasure Isle," "At College,"
"Down East," "In the Air," "In New York," and finally "In Alaska,"
where we last met the lads.

During all these adventures the Rover boys have been growing older.
Dick is now married and conducting his father's business in New York
City and elsewhere. 'The fun-loving Tom and his sturdy younger
brother, Sam, are at Brill College. The particulars are given of a
great baseball game; and then Tom and Sam return home, to he startled
by a most unusual message from Dick, calling them to New York
immediately. Some bonds of great value have mysteriously disappeared,
and unless these are recovered the Rover fortune may be seriously
impaired. What the boys did under these circumstances, I will leave
the pages which follow to disclose.

Once more thanking my host of young readers for the interest they have
taken in my books, I remain,

                 Affectionately and sincerely yours,

                                                   Arthur M. Winfield.

  CHAPTER I

 AT THE RIVER

"Sam!"

No answer.

"I say, Sam, can't you listen for just a moment?"

"Oh, Tom, please don't bother me now!" and Sam Rover, with a look of
worry on his face, glanced up for a moment from his writing-table.
"I've got to finish this theme before to-morrow morning."

"Oh, I know! But listen!" And Tom Rover's face showed his earnestness.
"Last night it was full moonlight, and to-night it is going to be
equally clear. Why can't we get out the auto and pay a visit to Hope?
You know we promised the girls that we would be up some afternoon or
evening this week."

"Sounds good, Tom, but even if we went after, supper, could we get
there in time? You know all visitors have to leave before nine
o'clock."

"We can get there if we start as soon as we finish eating. Can't you
finish the theme after we get back? Maybe I can help you."

"Help me? On this theme!" Sam grinned broadly. "Tom, you don't know
what you are talking about. Do you know what this theme is on?"

"No, but I can help you if I have to."

"This is on 'The Theory Concerning the Evolution of----'"

"That's enough, Sam; don't give me any of it now. Time enough for that
when we have to get at it. There goes the supper bell. Now, downstairs
with you! and let us get through as soon as possible and be on our
way."

"All right, just as you say!" and gathering up a number of sheets of
paper, Sam thrust them in the drawer of the writing-table.

"By the way, it's queer we didn't get any letter to-day from Dick,"
the youngest Rover observed.

At the mention of their brother's name, Tom's face clouded a little.

"It is queer, Sam, and I must say I don't like it. I think this is a
case where no news is bad news. I think if everything was going along
all right in New York, Dick would surely let us know. I am afraid he
is having a good deal of trouble in straightening out Dad's business."

"Just the way I look at it," responded Sam, as the brothers prepared
to leave the room.

"One thing is sure, Pelter, Japson & Company certainly did all they
could to mix matters up, and I doubt very much if they gave Dad all
that was coming to him."

"I believe I made a mistake in coming back to college," pursued Tom,
as the two boys walked out into the corridor, where they met several
other students on the way to the dining hall. "I think I ought to have
given up college and gone to New York City to help Dick straighten out
that business tangle. Now that Dad is sick again, the whole
responsibility rests on Dick's shoulders, and he ought not to be made
to bear it alone."

"Well, if you feel that way, Tom, why don't you break away and go? I
think, perhaps, it would be not only a good thing for Dick, but it
would, also, be a good thing for you," and, for the moment, Sam looked
very seriously at his brother.

Tom reddened a bit, and then put his forefinger to his forehead. "You
mean it would help me here?" And then, as Sam nodded, he added: "Oh,
don't you worry. I am all right now, my head doesn't bother me a bit.
But I do wish I could get just one good chance at Pelter for the crack
that rascal gave me on the head with the footstool."

"It certainly was a shame to let him off, Tom, hut you know how father
felt about it. He was too sick to be worried by a trial at law and all
that."

"Yes, I know, but just the same, some day I am going to square
accounts with Mr. Jesse Pelter," and Tom shook his head determinedly.

Passing down the broad stairway of Brill College, the two Rover boys
made their way to the dining hall. Here the majority of the students
were rapidly assembling for the evening meal, and the lads found
themselves among a host of friends.

"Hello, Songbird! How are you this evening?" cried Tom, as he
addressed a tall, scholarly-looking individual who wore his hair
rather long. "Have you been writing any poetry to-day?"

"Well,-- er-- not exactly, Tom," muttered John Powell, otherwise known
as Songbird because of his numerous efforts to compose what he called
poetry. "But I have been thinking up a few rhymes."

"When are you going to get out that book of poetry?"

"What book is that, Tom?"

"Why, as if you didn't know! Didn't you tell me that you were going to
get up a volume of 'Original International Poems for the Grave and
Gay;' five hundred pages, fully illustrated; and bound in full
leather, with title in gold, and "Tom, Tom, now please stop your
fooling!" pleaded Songbird, his face flushing. "Just because I write a
poem now and then doesn't say that I am going to publish a book."

"No, but I'm sure you will some day, and you'll make a fortune out of
it-- or fifteen dollars, anyway."

"The same old Tom!" cried a merry voice, and another student clapped
the fun-loving Rover on the shoulder. "I do believe you would rather
joke than eat!"

"Not on your life, Spud! and I'll prove it to you right now!" and
linking his arm through that of Will Jackson, otherwise "Spud," Tom
led the way to one of the tables, with Sam and several of the other
students following.

"What is on the docket for to-night?" asked Songbird, as he fell to
eating.

"Tom and I are going to take a little run in the auto to Hope,"
answered Sam.

"Oh, I see!" Songbird Powell shut one eye knowingly. "Going up there
to see the teachers, I suppose!"

"Sure, that is what they always do!" came from Spud, with a wink.

"Sour grapes, Spud!" laughed Sam. "You would go there yourself if you
had half a chance."

"Yes, and Songbird would want to go along, too, if we were bound for
the Sanderson cottage," put in Tom. "You see, in Songbird's eyes,
Minnie Sanderson is just the nicest girl----"

"Now stop it, Tom, can't you!" pleaded poor Songbird, growing
decidedly red in the face. "Miss Sanderson is only a friend of mine,
and you know it."

Just at that moment the students at the table were interrupted by the
approach of a tall, dudish-looking individual, who wore a
reddish-brown suit, cut in the most up-to-date fashion, and who
sported patent-leather shoes, and a white carnation in his buttonhole.
The newcomer took a vacant chair, sitting down with a flourish.

"I've had a most delightful ramble, don't you know," he lisped,
looking around at the others. "I have been through the sylvan woods
and by the babbling brook, and have----"

"Great Caesar's tombstone!" exclaimed Tom, looking at the newcomer
critically. "Why, my dearly beloved William Philander, you don't mean
to say that you have been delving through the shadowy nooks, and
playing with the babbling brook, in that outfit?"

"Oh, dear, no, Tom!" responded William Philander Tubbs. "I had another
suit on, the one with the green stripe, don't you know,-- the one I
had made last September-- or maybe it was in October, I can't really
remember. But you must know the suit, don't you?"

"Sure! I remember the suit. The green-striped one with the faded-out
blue dots and the red diamond check in the corner. Isn't that the same
suit you took down to the pawnbroker's last Wednesday night at fifteen
minutes past seven and asked him to loan you two dollars and a half on
it, and the pawnbroker wanted to know if the suit was your own?"

"My dear Tom!" and William Philander looked aghast. "You know well
enough I never took that suit to a pawnbroker."

"Well, maybe it was some other suit. Possibly the black one with the
blue stripes, or maybe it was the blue one with the black stripes.
Really, my dearest Philander, it is immaterial to me what suit it
was." And Tom looked coldly indifferent as he buttered another slice
of bread.

"But I tell you, I never went to any pawn-broker!" pleaded the dudish
student. "I would not be seen in any such horrid place!"

"Oh, pawnbrokers are not so bad," came from Spud Jackson, as he helped
himself to more potatoes. "I knew of one fellow down in New Haven who
used to loan thousands of dollars to the students at Yale. He was
considered a public benefactor. When he died they closed up the
college for three days and gave him a funeral over two miles long. And
after that, the students raised a fund of sixteen thousand dollars
with which to erect a monument to his memory. Now, that is absolutely
true, and if you don't believe it you can come to my room and I will
show you some dried rose leaves which came from one of the wreathes
used at the obsequies." And a general laugh went up over this
extravagant statement.

"The same old Spud!" cried Sam, as he gave the story-teller of the
college a nudge in the ribs. "Spud, you are about as bad as Tom."

"Chust vat I tinks," came from Max Spangler, a German-American student
who was still struggling with the difficulties of the language. "Only
I tinks bod of dem vas worser dan de udder." And at this rather mixed
statement another laugh went up.

"I wish you fellows would stop your nonsense and talk baseball," came
from Bob Grimes, another student. "Do you realize that if we expect to
do anything this spring, we have got to get busy?"

"Well, Bob," returned Sam, "I don't see how that is going to interest
me particularly. I don't expect to be on any nine this year."

"I know, Sam, but Tom, here, has promised to play if he can possibly
get the time."

"And so I will play," said Tom. "That is, provided I remain at Brill."

"What, do you mean to say you are going to leave!" cried several
students.

"We can't do without you, Tom," added Songbird.

"Of course we can't," came from Bob Grimes. "We need Tom the worst way
this year."

"Well, I'll talk that over with you fellows some other time. To-night
we are in a hurry." And thus speaking, Tom tapped his brother on the
shoulder, and both left the dining-room.

As my old readers know, the Rover boys possessed a very fine
automobile. This was kept in one of the new garages on the place,
which was presided over by Abner Filbury, the son of the old man who
had worked for years around the dormitories.

"Is she all ready, Ab?" questioned Tom, as the young man came forward
to greet them.

"Yes, sir, I filled her up with gas and oil, and she's in apple-pie
order."

"Why, Tom!" broke in Sam, in surprise. "You must have given this order
before supper."

"I did," and Tom grinned at his younger brother. "I took it for
granted that you would make the trip." And thus speaking, Tom leaped
into the driver's seat of the new touring car. Then Sam took his place
beside his brother, and in a moment more the car was gliding out of
the garage, and down the curving, gravel path leading to the highway
running from Ashton past Brill College to Hope Seminary.

As Tom had predicted, it was a clear night, with the full moon just
showing over the distant hills. Swinging into the highway, Tom
increased the speed and was soon running at twenty-five to thirty
miles an hour.

"Don't run too fast," cautioned Sam. "Remember this road has several
dangerous curves in it, and remember, too, a good many of the
countrymen around here don't carry lights when they drive."

"Oh, I'll be careful," returned Tom, lightly. "But about the lights, I
think some of the countrymen ought to be fined for driving in the
darkness as they do. I think----"

"Hark! what sort of a noise is that?" interrupted the younger Rover.

Both boys strained their ears. A shrill honk of a horn had been
followed by a heavy rumble, and now, around a curve of the road, shot
the beams from a single headlight perched on a heavy auto-truck. This
huge truck was coming along at great speed, and it passed the Rovers
with a loud roar, and a scattering of dust and small stones in all
directions.

"Great Scott!" gasped Sam, after he had recovered from his amazement.
"Did you ever see such an auto-truck as that, and running at such
speed?"

"Certainly some truck," was Tom's comment. "That must have weighed
four or five tons. I wonder if it came over the Paxton River bridge?"

"If it did, it must have given the bridge an awful shaking up. That
bridge isn't any too strong. It shakes fearfully every time we go over
it. Better run slow, Tom, when we get there."

"I will." And then Tom put on speed once more and the automobile
forged ahead as before.

A short run up-hill brought them to the point where the road ran down
to the Paxton River. In the bright moonlight the boys could see the
stream flowing like a sheet of silver down between the bushes and
trees. A minute more, and they came in sight of the bridge.

"Stop!" said Sam. "I may be mistaken, but that bridge looks shifted to
me."

"So it does," returned Tom, and brought the automobile to a
standstill. Both boys leaped out and walked forward.

To inspect the bridge in the bright moonlight was easy, and in less
than a minute the boys made a startling discovery, which was to the
effect that the opposite end of the structure had been thrown from its
supports and was in danger of falling at any instant.

"This is mighty bad," was Sam's comment. "Why, Tom, this is positively
dangerous. If anybody should come along here----"

"Hark!" Tom put up his hand, and both boys listened. From the top of
the hill they had left but a moment before, came the sounds of an
approaching automobile. An instant later the rays of the headlights
shot into view, almost blinding them.

"We must stop them!" came from both boys simultaneously. But scarcely
had the words left their lips, when they saw that such a course might
be impossible. The strange automobile was coming down the hill at a
furious rate. Now, as the driver saw the Rovers' machine, he sounded
his horn shrilly.

"He'll have a smash-up as sure as fate!" yelled Sam, and put up his
hand in warning. Tom did likewise, and also yelled at the top of his
lungs.

But it was too late. The occupant of the strange automobile-- for the
machine carried but a single person-- tried to come to a stop. The
brakes groaned and squeaked, and the car swept slightly to one side,
thus avoiding the Rovers' machine. Then, with power thrown off and the
hand-brake set, it rolled out on the bridge. There was a snap,
followed by a tremendous crash, and the next instant machine and
driver disappeared with a splash into the swiftly-flowing river.

  CHAPTER II

 TO THE RESCUE

The accident at the bridge had occurred so suddenly that, for the
instant, neither Rover boy knew what to do. They saw that the farther
end of the bridge had given way completely. Just where the end rested
in the water they beheld several small objects floating about, one of
them evidently a cap, and another a small wooden box. But the
automobile with its driver was nowhere to be seen.

"My gracious! That fellow will surely be drowned!" gasped Sam, on
recovering from the shock. "Tom, do you see him anywhere?"

"No, I don't." Tom took a few steps forward and gazed down into the
swiftly-flowing stream. "Perhaps he is pinned under the auto, Sam!"

"Wait, I'll get the searchlight," cried the younger Rover, and ran
back to their automobile. The boys made a point of carrying an
electric pocket searchlight to be used in case they had to make
repairs in the dark. Securing this, and turning on the light, Sam ran
forward to the river bank, with Tom beside him.

To those who have read the previous volumes in this "Rover Boys
Series" the lads just mentioned will need no special introduction. For
the benefit of others, however, let me state that the Rover boys were
three in number; Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom coming next,
and sturdy Sam being the youngest. Fame is not good for the hearts and
minds of simple folk."
"It will soon be over."
"I dread a sordid reaction."

The Seigneur stood thinking for a moment. "I have an idea," he said
at last. "Let us have these last days to ourselves. The mission ends
next Saturday at five o'clock. We will announce that all strangers
must leave the valley by Wednesday night.

Then, during those last three days, while yet the influence of
the play is on them, you can lead your own people back to the old
quiet feelings."
"My dear Maurice--it is worthy of you! It is the way.

We will announce it to-day. And see now. . . . For those three
days we will change the principals; lest those who have taken the
parts so long have lost the pious awe which should be upon them. We
will put new people in their places. I will announce it at vespers
presently. I have in my mind who should play the Christ, and St. John,
and St. Peter--the men are not hard to find; but for Mary the Mother
and Mary Magdalene--"

The eyes of the two men suddenly met, a look of understanding passed
between them.

"Will she do it?" said the Seigneur.

The Cure nodded.

"Paulette Dubois has heard the word, 'Go and sin no more'; she will
obey."
Walking through the village as they talked, the Cure shrank back
painfully several times, for voices of strangers, singing festive
songs, rolled out upon the road.

"Who can they be?" he said distressfully.

Without a word the Seigneur went to the door of the inn whence the sounds
proceeded, and, without knocking, entered. A moment afterwards the
voices stopped, but broke out again, quieted, then once more broke
out, and presently the Seigneur issued from the door, white with
anger, three strangers behind him. All were intoxicated.

One was violent.

It was Billy Wantage, whom the years had not improved.
He had arrived that day with two companions--an excursion of curiosity
as an excuse for a "spree."
"What's the matter with you, old stick-in-the-mud?" he shouted. "Mass
is over, isn't it? Can't we have a little guzzle between prayers?"
By this time a crowd had gathered, among them Filion Lacasse. At a
motion from the Seigneur, and a whisper that went round quickly,
a dozen habitants swiftly sprang on the three men, pinioned their
arms, and carrying them bodily to the pump by the tavern, held them
under it, one by one, till each was soaked and sober.

Then their horses and wagon were brought, and they were given five minutes
to leave the village.

With a devilish look in his eye, and drenched and furious, Billy was
disposed to resist the command, but the faces around him were determined,
and, muttering curses, the three drove away towards the next
parish.

CHAPTER LIII
THE SEIGNEUR AND THE CURE HAVE A SUSPICION
Presently the Seigneur and the Cure stood before the door of the
tailor-shop.

The Cure was about to knock, when the Seigneur laid a hand upon his
arm.

"There is no use; he has been gone several days," he said.

"Gone--gone!" said the Cure.

"I came to see him yesterday, and not finding him, I asked at the
post-office." M. Rossignol's voice lowered. "He told Mrs. Flynn he
was going into the hills, so Rosalie says."
The Cure's face fell. "He went away also just before the play began.
I almost fear that--that we get no nearer. His mind prompts him
to do good and not evil, and yet--and yet. . . . I have dreamed a good
dream, Maurice, but I sometimes fear I have dreamed in vain."
"Wait-wait!"
M. Loisel looked towards the post-office musingly. "I have thought
sometimes that what man's prayers may not accomplish a woman's love
might do. If--but, alas, what do we know of his past! Nothing.
What do we know of his future? Nothing. What do we know of the human
heart?

Nothing--nothing!"
The Seigneur was astounded. The Cure's meaning was plain. "What do
you mean?" he asked, almost gruffly.

"She--Rosalie--has changed--changed." In his heart he dwelt sorrowfully
upon the fact that she had not been to confession to him for many,
many months.

"Since her father's death--since her illness?"
"Since she went to Montreal seven months ago. Even while she was so ill
these past weeks, she never asked for me; and when I came . . . Ah,
if it is that her heart has gone out to the man, and his does not
respond!"

"A good thing, too!" said the other gloomily. "We don't know where he
came from, and we do know that he is a pagan."
"Yet there she sits now, hour after hour, day after day--so changed."

"She has lost her father," urged M. Rossignol anxiously.

"I know the grief of children--this is not such a grief. There
is something more. But I cannot ask. If she were a sinner--but she is
without fault. Have we not watched her grow up here, mirthful, brave,
pure-souled--"

"Fitted for any station," interposed the Seigneur huskily.
Presently he laid a hand upon the Cure's arm. "Shall I ask her again?"
he said, breathing hard. "Do you think she has found out her mistake?"

The Cure was so taken aback that at first he could not speak. When
he realised, however, he could scarce suppress a smile at the other's
simple vanity.

But he mastered himself, and said: "It is not that, Maurice. It is not
you."
"How did you know I had asked her?" asked his friend querulously.

"You have just told me."

M. Rossignol felt a kind of reproval in the Cure's tone. It made him a
little nervous. "I'm an old fool, but she needed some one," he
protested.

"At least I am a gentleman, and she would not be thrown away."
"Dear Maurice!" said the Cure, and linked his arm in the other's. "In
all respects save one, it would have been to her advantage.

But youth is the only comrade for youth. All else is evasion of life's
laws."

The Seigneur pressed his arm. "I thought you less worldly-wise
than myself; I find you more," he said.

"Not worldly-wise. Life is deeper than the world or worldly wisdom. Come,
we will both go and see Rosalie."
M. Rossignol suddenly stopped at the post-office door, and half turned
towards the tailor-shop. "He is young. Suppose that he drew her
love his way, but gave her nothing in return, and--"
"If it were so"--the Cure paused, and his face darkened--"if it
were so, he should leave her forever; and so my dream would end."

"And Rosalie?"
"Rosalie would forget.

To remember, youth must see and touch and be near, else it wears
itself out in excess of feeling.

Youth feels more deeply than age, but it must bear daily witness."

"Upon my honour, Cure, you shall write your little philosophies for
the world," said M. Rossignol, and then knocked at the door.

"I will go in alone, Maurice," the Cure urged. "Good-you are right,"
answered the other.

"I will go write the proclamation denying strangers the valley after
Wednesday. I will enforce it, too," he added, with vigour, and, turning,
walked up the street, as Mrs. Flynn admitted the Cure to the
post-office.

A half-hour later M. Loisel again appeared at the post-office door,
a pale, beautiful face at his shoulder.

He had not been brave enough to say what was on his mind.

But as he bade her good-bye, he plucked up needful courage.

"Forgive me, Rosalie," he said, "but I have sometimes thought that you
have more griefs than one. I have thought"--he paused, then went on
bravely--"that there might be--there might be unwelcomed love, or
love deceived."

A mist came before her eyes, but she quietly and firmly answered: "I
have never been deceived in love, Monsieur Loisel."
"There, there!" he hurriedly and gently rejoined. "Do not be hurt, my
child. I only want to help you." A moment afterwards he was gone.

As the door closed behind him, she drew herself proudly up.

"I have never been deceived," she said aloud. "I love him--love him--love
him."

CHAPTER LIV
M. ROSSIGNOL SLIPS THE LEASH
It was the last day of the Passion Play, and the great dramatic
mission was drawing to a close.

The confidence of the Cure and the Seigneur was restored. The prohibition
against strangers had had its effect, and for three whole days the
valley had been at rest again.

Apparently there was not a stranger within its borders, save the
Seigneur's brother, the Abbe Rossignol, who had come to see the
moving spectacle.

The Abbe, on his arrival, had made inquiries concerning the tailor of
Chaudiere and Jo Portugais, as persistently about the one as the
other.

Their secrets had been kept inviolate by him.

It was disconcerting to hear the tales people told of the tailor's
charity and wisdom.

It was all dangerous, for what was, accidentally, no evil in this
particular instance, might be the greatest disaster in another case.

Principle was at stake. He heard in stern silence the Cure's happy
statement that Jo Portugais had returned to the bosom of the Church,
and attended Mass regularly.

"So it may be, my dear Abbe," said M. Loisel, "that the friendship
between him and our 'infidel' has been the means of helping
Portugais.

I hope their friendship will go on unbroken for years and years."
"I have no idea that it will," said the Abbe grimly.

"That rope of friendship may snap untimely."
"Upon my soul, you croak like a raven!"

testily broke in M. Rossignol, who was present.

"I didn't know there was so much in common between you and my
surly-jowled groom.

He gets his pleasure out of croaking. 'Wait, wait, you'll see--you'll
see! Death, death, death--every man must die!
The devil has you by the hair--death--death--death!' Bah! I'm
heartily sick of croakers.

I suppose, like my grunting groom, you'll say about the Passion
Play, 'No good will come of it--wait--wait--wait!'

Bah!"
"It may not be an unmixed good," answered the ascetic.

  "Well, and is there any such thing on earth as an unmixed good?

 The play yesterday was worth a thousand sermons.

It was meant to serve Holy Church, and it will serve it. Was there ever
anything more real--and touching--than Paulette Dubois as Mary
Magdalene yesterday?"
"I do not approve of such reality.

For that woman to play the part is to destroy the impersonality of
the scene."
"You would demand that the Christus should be a good man, and the St.
John blameless--why shouldn't the Magdalene be a repentant woman?"
"It might impress the people more, if the best woman in your parish
were to play the part.

The fall of virtue, the ruin of innocence, would be vividly brought home.
It does good to make the innocent feel the terror and shame of sin.
That is the price the good pay for the fall of man--sorrow and
shame for those who sin."

The Seigneur, rising quickly from the table, and kicking his chair back,
said angrily: "Damn your theories!"

Then, seeing the frozen look on his brother's face, continued, more
excitedly: "Yes, damn, damn, damn your theories!

You always took the crass view.

I beg your pardon, Cure--I beg your pardon."
He then went to the window, threw it open, and called to his groom.

"Hi, there, coffin-face," he said, "bring round the horses--the
quietest one in the stable for my brother--you hear?

He can't ride," he added maliciously.

This was his fiercest stroke, for the Abbe's secret vanity was the
belief that he looked well on a horse, and rode handsomely.

CHAPTER LV
ROSALIE PLAYS A PART
From a tree upon a little hill rang out a bell--a deep-toned bell,
bought by the parish years before for the missions held at this
very spot.

Every day it rang for an instant at the beginning of each of the
five acts.

It also tolled slowly when the curtain rose upon the scene of the
Crucifixion.

In this act no one spoke save the abased Magdalene, who knelt at
the foot of the cross, and on whose hair red drops fell when the
Roman soldier pierced the side of the figure on the cross.

This had been the Cure's idea.

The Magdalene should speak for mankind, for the continuing world.
She should speak for the broken and contrite heart in all ages,
should be the first-fruits of the sacrifice, a flower of the desert
earth, bedewed by the blood of the Prince of Peace.

So, in the long nights of the late winter and early spring, the
Cure had thought and thought upon what the woman should say from
the foot of the cross.

At last he put into her mouth that which told the whole story of
redemption and deliverance, so far as his heart could conceive
it--the prayer for all sorts and conditions of men and the general
thanksgiving of humanity.

During the last three days Paulette Dubois had taken the part of
Mary Magdalene.

As Jo Portugais had confessed to the Abbe that notable day in the woods
at Vadrome Mountain, so she had confessed to the Cure after so many
years of agony--and the one confession fitted into the other: Jo
had once loved her, she had treated him vilely, then a man had
wronged her, and Jo had avenged her--this was the tale in brief.

She it was who laughed in the gallery of the court-room the day that
Joseph Nadeau was acquitted.

It had pained and shocked the Cure more than any he had ever heard,
but he urged for her no penalty as Portugais had set for himself with
the austere approval of the Abbe.

Paulette's presence as the Magdalene had had a deep effect upon the
people, so that she shared with Mary the Mother the painfully real
interest of the vast audience.

Five times had the bell rung out in the perfect spring air, upon which
the balm of the forest and the refreshment of the ardent sun were
poured.

The quick anger of M. Rossignol had passed away long before the Cure,
the Abbe, and himself had reached the lake and the great plateau.

Between the acts the two brothers walked up and down together, at
peace once more, and there was a suspicious moisture in the
Seigneur's eyes.

The demeanour of the people had been so humble and rapt that the place
and the plateau and the valley seemed alone in creation with the lofty
drama of the ages.

The Cure's eyes shone when he saw on a little knoll in the trees,
apart from the worshippers and spectators, Charley and Jo Portugais.

His cup of content was now full. He had felt convinced that if the
tailor had but been within these bounds during the past three days, a
work were begun which should end only at the altar of their parish
church.

To-day the play became to him the engine of God for the saving of a
man's soul. Not long before the last great tableau was to appear he
went to his own little tent near the hut where the actors prepared
to go upon the stage.

As he entered, some one came quickly forward from the shadow of the trees
and touched him on the arm.

"Rosalie!" he cried in amazement, for she wore the costume of Mary
Magdalene.

"It is I, not Paulette, who will appear," she said, a deep light
in her eyes.

"You, Rosalie?" he asked dumfounded. "You are distrait. Trouble and
sorrow have put this in your mind. You must not do it."
"Yes, I am going there," she said, pointing towards the great stage.

"Paulette has given me these to wear"--she touched the robe--"and I
only ask your blessing now. Oh, believe, believe me, I can speak
for those who are innocent and those who are guilty; for those who
pray and those who cannot pray; for those who confess and those who
dare not!

I can speak the words out of my heart with gladness and agony, Monsieur,"
she urged, in a voice vibrating with feeling.

A luminous look came into the Cure's face. A thought leapt up in his
heart. Who could tell!

--this pure girl, speaking for the whole sinful, unbelieving, and
believing world, might be the one last conquering argument to the
man.

He could not read the agony of spirit which had driven Rosalie to
this--to confess through the words of Mary Magdalene her own woe,
to say it out to all the world, and to receive, as did Paulette
Dubois, every day after the curtain came down, absolution and
blessing.

She longed for the old remembered peace.

The Cure could not read the struggle between her love for a man and
the ineradicable habit of her soul; but he raised his hand, made
the sacred gesture over leer, and said: "Go, my child, and God be
with you."

He could not see her for tears as she hurried away to where Paulette
Dubois awaited her--the two at peace now.

At the hands of the lately despised and injurious woman Rosalie was
made ready to play the part in the last act, none knowing save the
few who appeared in the final tableau, and they at the last moment
only.

The bell began to toll.

A thousand people fell upon their knees, and with fascinated yet
abashed and awe-struck eyes saw the great tableau of Christendom:
the three crosses against the evening sky, the Figure in the centre,
the Roman populace, the trembling Jews, the pathetic groups of
disciples.

A cloud passed across the sky, the illusion grew, and hearts quivered
in piteous sympathy. There was no music now--not a sound save
the sob of some overwrought woman.

The woe of an oppressed world absorbed them. Even the stolid Indians,
as Roman soldiers, shrank awe-stricken from the sacred tragedy. Now
the eyes of all were upon the central Figure, then they shifted for
a moment to John the Beloved, standing with the Mother.

"Pauvre Mere! Pauvre Christ!" said a weeping woman aloud.

A Roman soldier raised a spear and pierced the side of the Hero of
the World. Blood flowed, and hundreds gasped. Then there was silence--a
strange hush as of a prelude to some great event.

"It is finished. Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit," said
the Figure.

The hush was broken by such a sound as one hears in a forest when
a wind quivers over the earth, flutters the leaves, and then sinks
away--neither having come nor gone, but only lived and died.

Again there was silence, and then all eyes were fixed upon the figure
at the foot of the cross-Mary the Magdalene.

Day after day they had seen this figure rise, come forward a step, and
speak the epilogue to this moving miracle-drama. For the last
three days Paulette Dubois had turned a sorrowful face upon them, and
with one hand upraised had spoken the prayer, the prophecy, the
thanksgiving, the appeal of humanity and the ages. They looked to see
the same figure now, and waited.

But as the Magdalene turned, there was a great stir in the multitude,
for the face bent upon them was that of Rosalie Evanturel. Awe and
wonder moved the people.

Apart from the crowd, under a clump of trees, knelt a woodsman from
Vadrome Mountain, and the tailor of Chaudiere stood beside him.

When Charley, touched by the heavy scene, saw the figure of the Magdalene
rise, he felt a curious thrill of fascination. When she turned,
and he saw the face of Rosalie, the blood rushed to his face; then his
heart seemed to stand still. Pain and shame travelled to the farthest
recesses of his nature. Jo Portugais rose to his feet with a startled
exclamation.

Rosalie began to speak. "This is the day of which the hours shall
never cease--in it there shall be no night. He whom ye have crucified
hath saved you from the wrath to come. He hath saved others, Himself
He would not save.

Even for such as I, who have secretly opened, who have secretly
entered, the doors of sin--"
With a gasp of horror and a mad desire to take her away from the
sight of this gaping, fascinated crowd, Charley made to rush forward,
but Jo Portugais held him back.

"Be still. You will ruin her, M'sieu'!" said Jo.

"--even for such as I am," the beautiful voice went on, "hath He
died.
And in the ages to come, women such as I, and all women who sorrow,
and all men who err and are deceived, and all the helpless world,
will know that this was the Friend of the human soul."

Not a gesture, not a movement, only that slight, pathetic figure,
with pale, agonised face, and eyes that looked--looked--looked
beyond them, over their heads to the darkening east, the clouded
light of evening behind her.

Her voice rang out now valiant and clear, now searching and piteous,
yet reaching to where the farthermost person knelt, and was lost
upon the lake and in the spreading trees.

"What ye have done may never be undone; what He hath said shall never
be unsaid. His is the Word which shall unite all languages, when ye
that are Romans shall be no more Romans, and ye that are Jews shall
still be Jews, reproached and alone.

No longer shall men faint in the glare--the shadow of the Cross
shall screen them.

No more shall woman bear her black sorrows, alone; the Light of the
World shall cheer her."

As she spoke, the cloud drew back from the sunset, and the
saffron glow behind lighted the cross, and shone upon her hair,
casting her face in a gracious shadow.

Her voice rose higher. "I, the Magdalene, am the first-fruits of this
sacrifice: from the foot of the cross I come.

I have sinned more than all. I have shamed all women. But I have
confessed my sin, and He is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

Her voice now became lower, but clear and even, pathetically
exulting:

"O world, forgive, as He hath forgiven you!

Fall, dark curtain, and hide this pain, and rise again upon forgiven
sin and a redeemed people!"

She stood still, with her eyes upraised, and the curtain came slowly
down.

For a long time no one in all the gathered multitude stirred.

Far over under the trees a man sat upon the ground, his head upon his
arms, and his arms upon his knees, in a misery unmeasurable. Beside him
stood a woodsman, who knew of no word to say that might comfort him.

A girl, in the garb of the Magdalene, entered the tent of the Cure,
and, speaking no word, knelt and received absolution of her sins.

CHAPTER LVI
MRS.

FLYNN SPEAKS
CHARLEY left Jo Portugais behind, and went home alone.

He watched at a window till he saw Rosalie return.

As she passed quickly down the street with Mrs. Flynn to her own
door, he observed that her face was happier than he had seen it for
many a day.

Her step was lighter, there was a freedom in her air, a sense of
confidence in her carriage.

She bore herself as one who had done a thing which relaxed a painful
tension. There was a curious glow in her eyes and face, and this
became deeper as, showing himself at the door, she saw him, smiled,
and stood still. He came across the street and took her hand.

"You have been away," she said softly. "For a few days," he answered.

"Far?"
"At Vadrome Mountain."
"You have missed these last days of the Passion Play," she said, a
shadow in her eyes.

"I was present to-day," he answered.

  She turned away her head quickly, for the look in his eyes told her
more than any words could have done, and Mrs.

 Flynn said:

"'Tis a day for everlastin' mimory, sir.

For the part she played this day, the darlin', only such as she could
play! 'Tis the innocent takin' the shame o' the guilty, and the
tears do be comin' to me eyes. 'Tis not ould Widdy Flynn's eyes
alone that's wet this day, but hearts do be weepin' for the love
o' God."
Rosalie suddenly opened the door, and, without another look at
Charley, entered the house.
"'Tis one in a million!" said Mrs. Flynn, in a confidential tone,
for she had a fixed idea that Rosalie loved Charley and that he
loved her, and that the only thing that stood in the way of their
marriage was religion."Didn't somebody go into the office after you were there?"

"I don't know, Tom. In fact, nobody seems to know."

"I was in the office with another girl about five minutes before
Nellie went there," came from Grace. "I saw the ring there, too, and I
thought it was very foolish to leave it so exposed. Why, anybody could
have run off with it."

"It certainly was careless," put in Sam.

"Miss Harrow said she was on the point of putting it in the safe when
she was called by 'phone to one of the other buildings. She had a
dispute to settle between some of the hired help, and she did not
think of the ring until some time later. Then, so she says, she rushed
back to the office to find it missing."

"Well, I think it is a shame that she accused Nellie," said Tom,
stoutly and with something of a savage look in his eyes. "Nellie, if I
were you, I wouldn't stand for it."

"She-- she hasn't accused me, exactly," returned the suffering girl.
"But she intimated that I must have taken the ring, so it's just as
bad."

"What does the seminary management have to say about it?" asked Sam.

"They seem to think it lies between Nellie and the teacher," answered
Grace.

"In that case, how do we know the teacher didn't take the ring
herself?" broke in Tom, quickly.

"Oh, do you think that possible?" questioned Nellie, in surprise.

"It's more reasonable to think she took it than you did. Anyway, she
hasn't any right to accuse you," went on Tom, bluntly.

"As I said, Tom, she hasn't accused me-- that is, openly; but I know
what she thinks, and I know what she will make others think," returned
Nellie. And now she showed signs of bursting into tears again. "Oh, I
feel as if I must pack up and go home!"

"Don't you do it, Nellie. That would make it look as if you were
guilty. You stay here and face the music." Then, as Nellie began to
cry again, Tom took her in his arms and held her tightly.

"Come on!" said Sam, in a low tone of voice. "I think some people at
the window are listening." And he led the way to a distant portion of
the seminary grounds. After that, Grace told all she knew of the
miserable affair, and Nellie related just how she had seen the diamond
ring on the teacher's desk.

"Was the window open at the time?" questioned the older Rover boy.

"If I remember rightly, the window was tight shut," replied Nellie.

"Yes, it was shut when I was in the office," put in Grace. "I have
been trying to think out some way by which the ring could have
disappeared, but without success."

The matter was talked over for some time, and then the girls
questioned the boys regarding the happening at the broken bridge.
Nellie, and Grace also, wanted to know the latest news from Dick and
Dora.

"So far as I know, Dora is in fine health and enjoying herself in the
city," said Tom. "But Dick is having his hands full, and I rather
think that, sooner or later, I'll have to pack up and go to his
assistance."

"Then you'll leave Brill for good?" questioned Nellie.

"I think so. I can't be breaking in on my college course every now and
then as I have been doing, and pass my examinations. More than that, I
begin to believe that I was not cut out for a college man. I am like
Dick; I prefer a business career rather than a professional one. It is
Sam who is going to make the learned one of the family."

"Oh, come now, Tom! Don't pile it on!" pleaded the younger brother.
And yet he looked greatly pleased; and Grace looked pleased, too.

"But if you leave Brill, you won't be able to get here very often,
Tom," remarked Nellie, wistfully.

"That is true. But if I have to go to New York, why can't you go,
too?"

"Oh, Tom!"

"Well, that is what Dora did when Dick gave up his college career. I
think the folks understand----"

Just then a bell in the tower of the main seminary building began to
clang loudly. At the first stroke both girls started.

"There goes the first bell!" cried Grace. "We must go."

"Oh, hang the bell!" muttered Tom, and then, as Grace ran towards the
building, with Sam beside her, he once more caught Nellie by the hand.

"Now say, Nellie, don't you think----"

"Oh, Tom, I must get in before the second bell rings!" pleaded Nellie.

"Yes, but won't you promise----"

"How can I promise anything, Tom, with this affair of the missing
ring----"

"Missing ring! You don't suppose for one minute that that is going to
make any difference to me, do you?"

"Oh, no, Tom. I know you too well for that." And now Nellie gave him a
look that thrilled him through and through. "But I think I ought to
clear my name before-- before I do anything else."

"All right. I suppose it has got to be as you say," returned Tom,
hopelessly. "But listen! If they make any more trouble for you,
promise me that you will let me know."

"All right, Tom, I will." And then, after Tom had stolen a quick kiss,
Nellie hastened her steps, and a few seconds later she and her sister
disappeared within the building.

"Do you know what I'd like to do, Sam?" muttered Tom, as the brothers
turned away from the seminary grounds in the automobile. "I'd like to
wring that Miss Harrow's neck! What right has she to accuse Nellie?"

"No right at all, Tom. But one thing is certain, the ring must be
missing. I don't think that the teacher had anything to do with taking
it. They don't have that sort here."

"Possibly not. At the same time, to my mind it is far more reasonable
to suppose that she took it than that Nellie had anything to do with
it," declared Tom, stoutly.

"If the window was closed down, it seems to me that the ring must have
been taken by somebody in the building," pursued Sam, thoughtfully.
"Perhaps one of the hired help did it."

"Maybe." Tom gave a long sigh. "I certainly hope they clear the matter
up before long. I shall be very anxious to hear from the girls about
it."

As the young collegians had received permission to be out after hours,
they did not attempt to take the short cut through The Shallows on
returning to Brill. Instead, they went around by another road, over a
bridge that was perfectly safe.

"It's not so late, after all," remarked Sam, as they entered their
room. "Perhaps I had better, finish that theme."

"Oh, finish it in the morning," returned Tom, with a yawn. "You'll
feel brighter."

"All right," answered Sam, who felt sleepy himself; and a few minutes
later the brothers retired.

The next morning found Sam at work on the theme long before the hour
for breakfast. Tom was also up, and said he would take a walk around
the grounds to raise an appetite.

"As if you needed anything of that sort," grinned Sam. "The first
thing you know, you'll be eating so much that the college management
will be charging you double for board."

Down on the campus, Tom ran into Songbird. and, a few minutes later,
William Philander Tubbs. Songbird, as usual, had a pad and pencil in
his hand.

"Composing verses, I suppose," remarked Tom. "What have you got now?"

"Oh, it isn't so very much," returned Songbird, hesitatingly. "It's a
little poem I was writing about dogs."

"Dogs!" chimed in William Philander. "My gracious me! What sort of
poetry can you get up about dogs? I must confess, I don't like them.
Unless, of course, they are the nice little lap-dog kind."

"This isn't about a lap-dog, exactly," returned Songbird. "It's about
a watchdog."

"Um! By the way, Songbird, haven't the Sandersons a new watchdog?"

"Yes." And now Songbird reddened a little.

"Well, let us have the poem, anyway. I love dogs, and some poetry
about them ought to run along pretty good."

Thereupon, rather hesitatingly, Songbird held up his writing-pad and
read the following:

  "The sun sinks low far in the west--
      The farmer plodeth home to rest,
   The watchdog, watching in the night,
      Assures him ev'ry thing is right."

"Fine!" cried Tom. "Real, dyed-in-the-wool poetry that, Songbird. Give
us some more." And then the would-be poet continued:

   "The sun comes up and it is morn,
      The farmer goes to plow his corn,
   The watchdog, watching through the day,
      Keeps ev'ry tramp and thief away."

   And be it night or be it day----"

  "The watchdog's there, and there to stay!"

continued Tom, and then on:

  "The watchdog, watching in his sleep,
      Catches each flea and makes him weep!"

"Catching fleas indeed!" interrupted Songbird. "Now, Tom, I didn't
have any fleas in this poem."

"But all dogs have fleas, Songbird-- they own them naturally. You
wouldn't deprive a poor, innocent dog of his inheritance, would you?"

"But, Tom, see here----"

"But I wanted to say the poem couldn't be better," went on the
fun-loving Rover. "Why don't you send it to some of the dog journals?
They would be sure to print it."

"Dog journals?" snorted the would-be poet. "Do you think I write for
such a class of publications as that?"

"Well, you might do worse," responded Tom, coolly. "Now, for a
first-class journal, they ought to pay you at least a dollar a foot."

"Oh, Tom, you are the worst ever!" murmured Songbird, as he turned
away. A few minutes later, Tom saw him sit down on a bench to compose
verses as industriously as ever.

"I think I must be going," said William Philander, who had listened to
Songbird's effort without making any comment.

"Wait a minute, my dear Billy, I want----"

"Now, Tom, please don't call me Billy," pleaded the dudish student.

"Oh, all right, Philly. I was just going to say----"

"Now, Tom, Philly is just as bad as Billy, if not worse. You know my
name well enough."

"All right, Tubblets. If you prefer any such handle to the tub, why
I----"

"Tom, if you are going to talk that way, I'll really have to leave
you, don't you know," cried William Philander. "I am not going to
stand for it any longer. I have told you at least a hundred times----"

"No, not a hundred times, not more than sixty-eight times at the
most," interrupted Tom.

"Well, I've told you enough times, anyway, Tom. So if you----"

"Don't say another word, or you'll make me weep," said Tom, and drew
down his face soberly. "Why, my dear fellow, I wouldn't hurt your
feelings, not for the world and a big red apple thrown in. But what I
was going to say was this: Are you going to play on our baseball team
this Spring? Somebody said you were going to pitch for us," and Tom
looked very much in earnest.

"Me pitch for you?" queried William Philander. "Why, who told you such
a story as that?"

"It's all over college, Tubbs, all over college. You must be
practicing pitching in private."

"But I don't know a thing about pitching. In fact, I don't know much
about baseball," pleaded the dudish student."

"Oh, come now, Tubbs-- you can't fool me. Most likely you have been
practicing in private, and when you come out on the diamond you will
astonish everybody. Well, I am glad to know that Brill College is
really to have a first-class pitcher at last. We need it if we are
going to win any baseball games.

"Now, Tom, I tell you that I don't know----"

"Oh, you can't fool me, William," declared Tom, positively. "I got the
information straight, and I know it is absolutely correct. You are
booked as the head pitcher for Brill this season." And thus speaking,
Tom turned on his heel and walked off, leaving William Philander Tubbs
much perplexed.

  CHAPTER V

 THREE LETTERS

A new idea had entered Tom's mind, and he lost no time in carrying it
out. Meeting Bob Grimes and Stanley Browne, he drew them quickly to
one side and mentioned the talk he had had with William Philander.

"Now, carry it along," he concluded. "If you do it properly, we'll
have a barrel of fun out of it."

"Right you are!" returned Bob, and Stanley winked knowingly. Then Tom
hurried off, to interview several others of the students, principally
those who were interested in the Brill baseball nine.

Just before the bell rang for breakfast, William Philander found
himself confronted by Bob, who shook hands cordially. "This is the
best news yet, William," said the baseball leader, heartily. "I have
been wondering what we were going to do for a pitcher this season."

"Yes, it's all to the merry," put in Stanley, who had come up with
Bob. "But tell us privately, William, are you going to depend on a
straight ball and speed, or are you going to give them some curves and
fadeaways?"

"Now, see here!" spluttered the dudish student. "I am not a baseball
pitcher, and I want. you to----"

"Oh, William, don't try that game on us! '" burst out Stanley. "We
know that you have been practicing pitching for the past two months;
that you took lessons from one of the greatest ball twirlers in the
Western League. Of course, we understand that you wanted to surprise
us; and I must confess, it is a surprise."

"But a mighty agreeable one," came from Spud, who had joined the
crowd, while Tom hovered behind William Philander, grinning broadly
over what was taking place. "Brill has wanted a really great pitcher
for years. Of course, we have won some victories with ordinary
pitchers, but the moment I heard that you had taken to twirling the
sphere, I said to all my friends; 'This is the year that Brill is
going to come out on top.' My dear Tubbs, I think we ought to get down
on our knees, and thank you for doing this much for our college. I am
sure the board of directors, when they hear of this, will certainly
give you a vote of thanks, because success in baseball and other
athletic sports is what makes a college in these days. And you are
taking up the sport in such a thoroughly systematic manner

"Oh, my dear fellow!" pleaded William Philander, frantically. "This is
all some dreadful mistake, don't you know. How it came about, I can't
imagine, but I haven't----"

"It's no use, fellows. He simply won't acknowledge it yet," broke in
another student.

"We'll have to wait until he comes out on the diamond in his new
uniform," added still another.

"Anyway, William, you might tell us whether you are going to use a
straight ball or a curve and the fadeaway," pleaded Stanley.

"He is going to keep that a secret, so as to fool our opponents,"
broke in Tom. "And he'll fool them all right enough, you can depend on
W. P. Tubbs every time."

"Three cheers for W. P.!" cried Spud. "Now, then, boys, altogether: W.
P., the champion pitcher of Brill College!"

A cheer and a yell rent the air, and brought a great number of other
students to that part of the campus. In a twinkling, William Philander
was completely surrounded.

"What's it all about?"

"Is it a fight?"

"Who are they cheering?"

"It's all about Mr. W. P. Tubbs, Esq.," cried Tom, loudly. "Our new,
double back-action, warranted, baseball twirler; the man who is going
to shoot 'em over the plate in such a marvelous fashion that our
rivals will go down and out in one, two, three order."

At his announcement, a great hubbub arose on all sides.

"Tubbs! is he a baseball pitcher?"

"I didn't know he knew a thing about baseball."

"That dude launching a fadeaway? That gets me!"

"Where did he learn to pitch?"

"Who put him on the team?"

"Say, Tubbs, explain this, won't you?" This last remark came from four
students in unison.

"You let me out of this!" cried the dudish student in despair. "It's
all some horrid joke! I am not going to pitch! I don't know anything
about pitching! I don't know hardly anything about baseball! I don't
want to play! Why, when a fellow falls down running around the bases,
he is apt to get all dirty! You let me out of this!" And so speaking,
William Philander Tubbs pushed his way out of the crowd, and fairly
ran for the nearest of the school buildings.

"I guess that will hold W. P. for a while," was Tom's comment, as the
tall student vanished.

"Good joke, Tom!" returned Bob.

"What's the matter with keeping it up?" added Spud. "Don't let him
know the truth. Maybe some day we can drag him out on the diamond."

"All right," answered Tom. "I'll do it;" and then, as the bell rang
for breakfast, all of the students hurried inside.

Some days passed, and during that time the Rover boys waited anxiously
for some news from their brother Dick, and also for word from Hope
Seminary. In the meantime, the lads had settled down to the usual
grind of college life, and were doing as well as could be expected
considering the interruptions their studies had suffered.

The Rover boys had already learned that the bridge across the Paxton
River had been repaired. The automobile, which had gone into the
stream, had been found intact, only needing some cleaning to make it
once more useable. It had been taken to the hotel garage. The young
man, who had been thrown into the stream at the time, was still in bed
under the doctor's care. Evidently, the shock to his system had been
more severe than had been at first supposed.

"Letters at last!" cried Tom, on the third morning, as he came in,
holding up several epistles. One was from Grace, another from Nellie,
and still a third from Dick.

As might have been expected, the boys opened the letters from the
girls first.

"Nothing new in this," remarked Tom, somewhat disappointedly, after
having read what Nellie had written. "She says that the diamond ring
has not yet been found, and that everything is at a standstill
concerning it."

"Grace says practically the same thing," returned Sam. "She adds that
Nellie is very much downcast, and she thinks that, while her friends
all stand by her, some of the girls are giving her the cold shoulder."

"It's an outrage! Oh, Sam, I wish I could do something!" And unable to
control his feelings, Tom clenched his hands and began to pace the
floor.

"It certainly is the meanest thing I ever heard of, Tom. But I don't
see what we can do. In fact, I don't see what anybody can do. The
seminary management must have made a thorough investigation, and if
they haven't discovered anything, I don't see how an outsider can
solve the mystery."

"Maybe they ought to shadow some of the hired help, or something like
that."

"They may be doing that, Tom. They certainly won't let a
four-hundred-dollar ring get away from them without making the biggest
kind of an effort to find out where it went. But open that letter from
Dick, and see what he has to say."

The communication was torn open, and Tom glanced over it hastily.

"Here's a surprise, Sam," he cried. "Well, what do you know about
this!" And he read as follows:

  "I have something of a surprise for you. In coming to a settlement
  with Pelter, Japson & Company, they notified me that they were
  going out of business in New York City. Pelter claims that our
  exposing the firm practically ruined them, and at the present time
  there is still due father a matter of about fifteen hundred
  dollars, which they seem unable to pay. Both Pelter and Japson have
  offered to turn over to us the entire contents of their offices in
  Wall Street, along with their lease. I don't think the outfit is
  worth the fifteen hundred dollars, but when you can't get all that
  is coming to you, the next best thing is to take what you can get.
  I am writing to father about this, and if he agrees with me, I
  shall take the lease of the offices, and also the outfit, which
  includes several desks, chairs, a safe and a filing cabinet. Pelter
  says the outfit was new two years ago, so that it is in quite good
  condition.

  "Dora sends her best regards. As you know, we are now installed in
  our suite at the Outlook Hotel, and she spends quite some of her
  time shopping and looking around the city. I have gone out with her
  a few times, but spend most of my time in straightening out these
  financial matters, and in taking care of father's other
  investments. Mr. Powell, the lawyer, is assisting me to unravel the
  tangle, but it is hard work, and I often wish that one or both of
  you were here to help me. Remember me to all the boys and likewise
  to Grace and Nellie.

  "By the way, I understand that Josiah Crabtree is soon to leave the
  hospital. His leg was so badly broken that he will have to walk
  with either a crutch or a couple of canes. In one way, I feel sorry
  for the old fellow, but he brought the accident on himself. What a
  shame that a man with his education couldn't have remained honest
  and straightforward.

  "As I said above, Pelter, Japson & Company, are going to give up
  business here. Just the same, I don't like Pelter's actions at all.
  I think he is a bad one through and through-- much worse than
  Japson-- who is more weak than wicked. I am going to keep my eyes
  open whenever Pelter is around."

Both boys read this communication from Dick with deep interest. Then
Sam read the letter a second time and looked thoughtfully at Tom.

"I don't think Dick is having any easy time of it," was his sober
comment.

"Just what I have been thinking all along, Sam. When Dick says he
wishes he had one or both of us with him, he means it. Just as soon as
the college term comes to a close, I am going to New York."

"Well, I'll go with you," returned Sam. "I did think we might go on
some kind of an outing during July and August, but it wouldn't be fair
to take the time off and leave Dick at the grind alone."

"Of course, I think we ought to go home first," continued Tom, after a
pause. "The folks will want to see us, and, besides, we will want to
talk matters over with dad, and also with Uncle Randolph. They may
want to tell us something about the business."

"Do you think that Uncle Randolph had much money invested with
father?"

"I don't know exactly what to think, Sam. Uncle Randolph is very
peculiar, and since father has been sick again, he has not wanted to
talk matters over very much. We will have to be careful of what we say
when we get home. It won't do, so the doctor said, to excite him too
much."

"Oh, I know that as well as you do. In fact, it might be best not to
mention business to dad at all. You must remember that this is the
third breakdown he has had since we came to Brill, and another such
turn might prove serious."

"Oh, don't talk like that! It makes me shiver to think of it. What in
the world would we do if anything happened to poor, dear dad!"

"If only Uncle Randolph was more of a business man, he might go to New
York and help Dick; but you know how he is all wrapped up in what he
calls 'scientific farming.' Of course, it doesn't amount to a hill of
beans, but he thinks it does, and he spends a great deal of money on
it that might be put to better usage."

"Well, it's his own money, you must remember, and he has a right to do
what he pleases with it. But for gracious sake! don't get him to go to
New York. It would only mix up matters worse than ever. Dick would not
only have to take care of the business, but he would also have to take
care of Uncle Randolph. Besides, it wouldn't be fair to leave Aunt
Martha to look after dad, alone." And there, for the time being, the
talk on personal matters came to an end.

  CHAPTER VI

 BASEBALL TALK

With so many other affairs to claim our attention, I have purposely
avoided going into the details of the baseball season at Brill that
year. As my old readers know, the college had a baseball nine and a
football eleven, and both had, at various times, done well at one
sport or the other.

This particular year, baseball matters had not gone as well as had
been expected. In the first place, several of the best players on the
nine had graduated the year before and left the college. Then had come
a long wet spell, during which time only some indoor practice in the
gymnasium could be attempted. Thus, at the opening of the season, the
nine possessed four players who had hitherto played only on the scrub,
and the whole team lacked the practice that was essential to success.
The most serious loss was in the battery, both the pitcher and catcher
of the year previous having left the college. Bob Grimes, who played
at shortstop, was the captain, and after a good many tryouts, he had
put Spud Jackson in as catcher. For pitcher, there were three
candidates: a lad named Bill Harney, who was a tall junior; a much
smaller chap who had come from Yale, named Dare Phelps; and Tom, who
had been pushed forward by a number of his friends. Tom had thought to
pay strict attention to his studies for the remainder of the term, but
finally agreed to accept the position if it was offered to him.

"I think you are going to make it, Tom," said Songbird one day after
Tom had been pitching on the regular team against Bill Harney, who had
been pitching on the scrub. Tom had managed to hold the scrub down to
three hits, while Harney had allowed fourteen hits, one of which had
been turned by the batter into a home run.

"Oh, I don't know about that," replied Tom. "Harney isn't so bad. He
had a little ill luck to-day, that's all. And then, don't forget
Phelps."

"I'm not forgetting either of them. Just the same, I think you are
going to make the nine."

The next day, Tom was put in as pitcher on the scrub, while Dare
Phelps occupied the box for the regular nine. For the first six
innings, it was a nip-and-tuck battle between the two pitchers. But
from that time on, Dare Phelps seemed to go to pieces, while Tom
struck out man after man. As a result, the score at the end of the
game stood 4 to 10 in favor of the scrub.

"Tom, I think that settles it!" cried his brother, as he rushed up and
took the other by the shoulder. "You certainly held them down in great
shape."

"And say, didn't the scrub bang Phelps all over the diamond!" broke in
another student. "My, he must feel pretty sore!" And evidently this
was true, because a minute later Dare Phelps left the diamond and
disappeared from view. Nearly everybody in the college had watched the
games between the scrub and the regular nine; and that night the
concensus of opinion seemed to be that Tom ought to pitch for the
regular team.

"You'll have to do it, Tom," said Bob Grimes, when he called on the
older Rover in the morning. "Phelps acknowledges that you are a better
pitcher than he is, and I think Bill Harney will have to do the same."

"Better wait and see how I pitch in one of the regular games,"
returned Tom, modestly. "For all you know, I may go to pieces."

"Nonsense, Tom! I know you too well for that," and Bob grinned
broadly. "We'll show Roxley College this year what we can do."

Every year there were two contests between Brill and Roxley, a rival
college located some miles away. One contest was at baseball, and the
other football. During the past Fall, Roxley had suffered its second
defeat on the gridiron at the hands of Brill. But the Spring previous,
its baseball nine had literally "wiped up the diamond" with Brill by a
score of 6 to 0. My, readers can, therefore, well imagine how anxious
the baseball management was to win the game scheduled to come off in
about a week.

Since returning to college from his trip to New York, and then the
longer trip to Alaska, Sam had given almost his entire time to his
studies. He was quite a baseball player, but he felt that to play on
the regular team would take too much of his time.

"If you are going to leave college this June, it won't make so much
difference whether you pass with flying colors or not, Tom," he said.
"But if I am to return in the Fall, I want to make sure that I am not
going to do so under conditions."

"But, Sam, I don't see why you can't play a game or two," persisted
Tom. "It doesn't seem natural for you to keep out of it altogether."

"Well, I have played some on the scrub."

"Oh, I know, but that isn't like going in for the regular thing. You
could be on the regular team if you really wanted to."

This matter was talked over several times, but Sam refused to be
entirely persuaded. He, however, finally agreed to go on the bench as
a substitute, provided Bob would not ask him to play any inside
position. By a toss-up, it had been decided that the game should take
place on the Roxley grounds. As a consequence, the boys of Brill and
their friends would have to go to the other college either by train
from Ashton, or in automobiles or some other kinds of conveyances.

"Of course, we'll take the girls, Tom," said Sam, in talking the
matter over. "We can go over to Hope in the auto for them, and I think
it would be nice if we took Songbird along and stopped at the
Sanderson cottage for Minnie."

"All right, that suits me," replied Tom, "Let us ask Songbird about
it."

Of course the would-be poet was delighted, and he at once sent a note
to Minnie, asking her to be ready when the auto arrived. The girls at
Hope were communicated with over the telephone.

"I'm afraid it's going to rain," said Spud, on the evening before the
great game was to take place. And Spud was right. By nine o'clock it
was raining steadily.

"Just our confounded luck!" muttered Songbird, as he paced up and down
the room which he and half a dozen others were occupying. "Now, I
suppose that game and our nice auto ride will be all knocked in the
head."

"Don't worry so early," returned Sam, cheerfully. "I don't think this
is anything more than a shower, and we need that to lay the dust." Sam
proved to be right, for before some of the boys retired, the rain had
stopped coming down, and one by one the stars began to appear. In the
morning, the sun came up as bright as ever, and by ten o'clock the
ground was as dry as any one could wish. The day was a Saturday, and,
of course, a holiday both at Brill and Roxley. By eleven o'clock, a
carryall had taken a large number of the students to Ashton, where
they were to take a special train for Roxley. All of the automobiles
at Brill were in use, and with them all of the turnouts that could be
hired in the vicinity.

"No time to spare!" sang out Tom, as he ran the automobile up to the
college steps.

"I am ready," said Sam, who had a dresssuit case with Tom's uniform
and his own in it.

"Where is Songbird?"

"I don't know, I thought he was with you."

"Here I am!" came the cry, and the would-be poet of the college came
rushing across the campus. He was dressed in his very best suit, and
wore a rose in his buttonhole.

"Wait! I almost forgot the horns!" cried Sam, and he darted back into
the building, to reappear a few seconds later with several long tin
horns. Into the automobile piled the boys, and then, with a loud
sounding of the horn, Tom turned on the power, and the machine started
off in the direction of Hope, soon reaching the spot where the
automobile had gone into the river.

"That poor chap didn't hurt his machine much. so I have heard,"
remarked Sam, as they bowled along over the bridge. "But, I think it
might have been better if he had come out of it scott free, and the
auto had gone to pieces."

"We ought to call on him, Sam," returned Tom. "I would like to find
out whether or not he is related to Jesse Pelter."

"Oh, don't bother about that to-day. Let your, mind rest on the game--
and the girls," and Sam grinned faintly.

The run to the seminary did not take long. The Laning girls stood
waiting on the porch, and once they were in the car, the machine was
headed in the direction of the Sanderson cottage.

Nellie occupied the front seat with Tom, while Sam was in the tonneau
with Grace and Songbird. The younger girl was in her usual happy mood,
but Nellie's face showed worriment.

"Have you heard anything more about the missing ring?" questioned Tom,
while on the way to the Sanderson farmhouse.

"Not a thing, Tom," answered Nellie, soberly.

"Of course they have questioned the hired help?"

"Yes. And they have also questioned a number of the teachers and the
students."

"Has Miss Harrow said anything more about it to you?"

"No, but every time we meet, she gives me such a cold look that it
fairly makes me shiver. Oh, Tom, sometimes I don't know how I am going
to stand it!" And now the girl showed signs of breaking down.

"There, there! Don't think about it any more, Nellie-- at least, for
to-day. Think of the jolly good time we are going to have and how we
are going to defeat Roxley."

"Do you think Brill will win, Tom? I heard some of the girls at Hope
say that they were sure Roxley would come out ahead. They said they
have an unusually strong nine this year, and that they have already
won some games from the strongest nines around here."

"Well, that is true. Nevertheless, we hope to come out ahead."

"Sure we'll come out ahead!" cried Songbird. "With Tom in the box it's
a cinch."

"Just what I say," broke in Sam. "Tom has got some curves that are
bound to fool them."

In order to make time, Tom had put on nearly all the speed of which
the car was capable, and in a short while they came in sight of the
Sanderson farm. Mr. Sanderson was at work in an apple orchard near by,
and waved his hand to them as the machine drew up to the horse-block.

"Better come along," sang out Sam, gaily.

"I wouldn't mind a-seein' the game," returned the old farmer. "But
I've promised to pick these early apples and ship 'em. I wish you boys
luck." And then he brought over a pail full of apples, and dumped them
in the tonneau of the car. Minnie, looking as fresh and sweet as ever,
was on the piazza, and when the car stopped she hurried down the
garden walk. Songbird leaped out and helped her in beside Grace,
shaking hands at the same time.

"Good gracious, Pa! how could you do so?" said Minnie, reproachfully,
as she stepped between the apples.

"Oh, I thought as how ye might git hungry on th' way," returned Mr.
Sanderson, with a broad grin. "If ye don't want to eat them, you feed
your hosses on 'em." And he laughed at his little' joke.

"We'll eat them fast enough don't worry," cried Sam, and then, with a
toot of the horn, the automobile proceeded on its way to Roxley.

  CHAPTER VII

 THE GREAT BASEBALL GAME

"Some crowd, this!"

"Well, I should say so! Say, this is the biggest crowd we ever had at
any game."

"And look at the new grandstand, all decked out in flags and banners!"

"And look at the automobiles! We'll have to hurry up, or all the
parking space will be gone."

"Hurrah, Brill! Come down here to see us defeat you, eh?" And a merry
looking student, wearing the colors of Roxley on his cap, and waving a
Roxley banner in his hand, grinned broadly at Tom and the others.

"No, we came to bury you," retorted Sam. "It's all over but the
shouting." And then he took up one of the horns he had brought, and
sounded it loudly.

"Better let me take the car to the other end of the grounds,"
suggested Songbird. "You fellows will want to get into your uniforms
and into practice."

"Oh, we want to get good seats for the girls first," broke in Tom. "It
won't take long to park the machine."

In a moment more, they found themselves in a perfect jam of touring
cars, motor cycles, and carriages. Finding a suitable spot, Tom
brought the touring car to a standstill, turned off the power, and
placed the starting plug in his pocket. Then the entire party made its
way as rapidly as possible to the grandstand, one-half of which had
been reserved for the students of Brill and their friends. Here
Songbird took charge of matters.

"Just leave it all to me," he said. "You fellows go in and win."

"Yes, you must win, by all means, Tom!" cried Nellie. "Just remember
that I've got my eye on you."

"Yes, we all want you to win," came from Minnie Sanderson. "I am going
to root-- isn't that the right word?-- for all I know how."

"That's the word!" cried Sam. "I declare, before you get through,
you'll be a regular baseball fan!" And at this sally there was a
general laugh.

Tom and Sam would have liked it had they been able to stay with the
girls longer, but the other members of the team were already in the
dressing room, donning their uniforms, and thither the Rovers made
their way. A short while later, the word was passed around, and the
Brill team marched out on the grounds for practice; even Sam, as a
substitute, taking part. Evidently, the outsiders living in that
vicinity were of the opinion that the game would be well worth seeing,
for long after the grandstand and the bleachers were filled, the crowd
kept coming in the several gates.

"My, but this is going to be the banner game so far as attendance
goes," remarked Sam to Bob.

"Yes, and it will bring us in a neat bit of money," returned the Brill
captain.

"How are they going to divide this year?"

"One-third and two-thirds," returned Bob; meaning thereby that the
winning team would take two-thirds of the receipts, and the losing
team the remaining third. This money, of course, did not go to the
individual players, but was put into the general athletic fund of each
college.

Roxley won the toss, and as a consequence, Brill went to bat first. As
the first man took his position, there were cries of all sorts,
mingled with the tooting of many horns and the sounds of numerous
rattles.

"Now then, Brill, show 'em what you can do!"

"Knock a home run first thing!"

"Don't let 'em see first, Roxley! Kill 'em at the plate!"

The Roxley pitcher took his position, wound up; and the ball came in
quickly.

"Ball one."

"That's right! Make him give you a good one."

Again the ball came in, and this time, as it was a fairly good one,
the batter swung for it, and missed.

"Strike one."

"That's the talk, give him another like that, Carson!"

Again the ball came whizzing over the plate. The batsman struck it
fairly, and it sailed down toward second base. The runner was off like
a shot, but it availed him nothing. The second baseman caught the fly
with ease.

"Hurray! One down! Now for the other two!"

The second man at the bat went out in one-two-three order. Then the
third player up knocked a short fly to first.

"Three out. That's the way to do it, Roxley!"

"Now, for a few runs!"

It must be confessed that Tom was a trifle nervous when he took the
ball and walked down to the box. The eyes of over twelve hundred
spectators were on him, and those included the eyes of the girl he
thought the dearest in all the world. He gave a short sigh, and then
suddenly braced up. "I've got to do it," he muttered to himself. "I've
simply got to!"

As was to be expected, Roxley had its best batters on the top of the
list. The first fellow to face Tom was a hitter well-known for his
prowess. As Tom had heard that this man loved a low ball, he purposely
sent in the sphere rather high.

"One ball."

"That's right, Clink! Make him give you what you want."

The next ball was intended for an out-curve, but, somehow, Tom missed
it, and it came in fairly over the plate. Crack! The bat connected
with it, and away the sphere sailed to center field.

"Run, run!" The cry echoed from all sides, and, almost in a twinkling,
Clink was down to first, and racing for second. Then, feeling that he
had time to go further, he bounded onward, and slid safely to third.

"That's the way to do it! Look, a three-bagger!"

"Hurray! We've got them on the run; keep it up, boys!" And then the
air was rent with the noise of horns and rattles.

"Steady, Tom, steady," whispered Bob, as he walked toward the pitcher.
"Don't let them rattle you; take your time."

"They are not going to rattle me," returned Tom, and set his teeth
hard. He faced the new batsman, and then, of a sudden, twirled around
and sent the ball whizzing to third.

"Look out! look out!" yelled the coach at third, and Clink dropped and
grabbed the sack just in the nick of time. Then Tom went for the
batter. One strike was called, and then two balls, and then another
strike, and a ball.

"Don't walk him, Tom, whatever you do," said Spud, as he came down to
consult with the pitcher.

"All right. What do you think I ought to give him?"

"Try him on an in-shoot."

Once again, Tom sent the ball over to third, almost catching Clink
napping as before. Then, the instant he had the sphere once more in
his possession, he sent it swiftly in over the plate.

"Three strikes! Batter out!"

"Good for you, Rover! That's the way to do it!"

"Now kill the other two, Tom!"

But to "kill the other two" was not so easy. The next man went out on
a pop fly to third, which held Clink where he was. Following that came
a safe hit which took the batter to first and allowed Clink to slide
in with the first run. For the moment pandemonium seemed to break
loose. The Roxley cohorts cheered wildly and sounded their horns and
rattles. Brill, of course, had nothing to say.

"Oh, Songbird, they got in a run!" remarked Nellie, much dismayed.

"Well, the game is young yet," returned the Brill student.
Nevertheless, he felt much crestfallen to think that Roxley had scored
first.

With one run in, and a man on first, Roxley went to the bat with more
confidence than ever. But it availed nothing, for Tom finished the
inning with the Roxley runner getting no further than second.

"Now, boys, we've got to do something," said the Brill captain, when
the nine came in. "Two runs at least, and three if we can possibly get
them."

"What's the matter with half a dozen, while we are at it?" laughed the
second baseman.

"All right. As many as you please," returned Bob.

But it was not to be. With all her efforts, Brill managed, during this
inning, to get no further than third. Tom came in for a try at the
bat, but the best he could do was to send up a little pop fly that the
rival pitcher gathered in with ease. Then Roxley came in once more,
and added another run to her credit.

"Hurrah for Roxley! That makes it two to nothing!"

There were looks of grim determination on the faces of the Brill
players when they went to the plate for the third time. The first man
up was struck out, but the second sent a clean drive to left field
that was good for two bases. Then came a sacrifice hit by Spud, that
advanced the runner to third, and on another one-base hit, this run
came in amid a wild cheering by the Brill followers.

"Hurrah! One run in! Now, boys, you've broken the ice, keep it up!"
And then the horns and rattles of the Brillites sounded as loudly as
had those of the Roxley followers a short while before.

But, alas! for the hopes of our friends! The only other run made that
inning was a third by Roxley!

During the fourth inning, Roxley added another run to her score. Brill
did nothing, so that the score now stood 4 to 1 in favor of Roxley.
The fifth inning was a stand-off, neither side scoring. Then came the
sixth, in which Frank Holden, the first baseman, distinguished himself
by rapping out a three-bagger, coming in a few seconds later on a hit
by the man following him.

"Up-hill work, and no mistake!" said the Brill captain, when the team
had come in for the seventh inning.

"See here, Bob, if you think you would rather try some of the other
pitchers----" began Tom.

"Nothing of the sort, old man. You are doing very well. I don't
consider four runs against two any great lead. And you haven't walked
as many men as their pitcher."

The seventh inning brought no change in the score. But in the eighth,
Roxley added another run, bringing her total up to five.

"Looks kind of bad," said Sam, to another substitute on the bench.
"Five to two, and the ninth inning. We've got to play some if we want
to beat them."

"Sam, I want you!" cried Bob, coming up. "Felder has twisted his foot,
and you will have to take his place in left field,"

"Am I to bat in his place?" questioned the youngest Rover.

"Yes."

"All right. I'll do the best I can."

There was silence around the grounds when the Brill team came to the
bat. With the score 5 to 2 in favor of Roxley, it looked rather
dubious for the visitors. Some of the onlookers, thinking the game
practically over, started towards the gates, and the carriages and
automobiles. The first man up was the captain, and he walked to the
plate with a "do or die" look on his face.

"Now, Bob, lam it out for all you are worth!" shouted one of his
admirers.

The first ball sent in was too low, and Bob let it pass him; but the
second was just where he wanted it. The bat swung around like
lightning, and, following a loud crack, the sphere sailed off towards
left field.

"Run, Bob, run!" yelled a great number of his friends, and the captain
let go all the speed that was in him. When the ball finally reached
the diamond, it found Bob safe on third.

"That's the way to open up! Now, then, bring him in!"

This was not so easy. The batter up tried a sacrifice hit, but the
ball rolled down well towards the pitcher, who landed it at first in a
twinkling. Bob attempted to get home, but then thought better of it,
and slid back to third. The next batter up was Sam. He had with him
his favorite ash stick, and, as he stepped behind the plate, he
gritted his teeth and eyed the pitcher closely.

Carson had been practicing on what he called a fadeaway ball, and now
he thought this would be just the right thing to offer Sam. He wound
up with a great flourish, and sent the sphere in.

Sam was on his guard, and calculated just right. His bat came around
in a clean sweep, and on the instant the ball was flying down towards
deep center.

"My! look at that!"

"Run, Rover, run!"

No sooner had the ball connected with the bat, than Bob, at third, was
on his way home. He reached the plate before Sam touched first. Then
Sam, skirting the initial bag, tore straight for second, and then for
third. In the meantime, the fielder was still running after the ball.
As Sam started for home, the fielder managed to capture the sphere,
and threw it with all his skill to the second baseman.

"Run, Sam, run!" yelled Tom, fairly dancing up and down in his
anxiety. "Leg it, old man, leg it!"

And certainly Sam did "leg it" as he never had before. Straight for
the home plate he came, and slid in amid a cloud of dust, just before
the ball came up from the field.

"Hurrah! hurrah! a home run!"

"Now, boys, we've started the ball rolling," cried out Bob. "Remember,
only one more run ties the score."

  CHAPTER VIII

 HOW THE GAME ENDED

The next batter up was plainly nervous. He had two strikes called on
him, and then he knocked a small foul, which was quickly gathered in
by the third baseman. Then Tom came to the bat, and was lucky enough
to make a clean one-base hit. After that, came several base hits in
rapid succession. These brought in not only Tom, but also the man
behind him. Then came a bad fumble on the part of the Roxley
shortstop, and, as a result, another run was put up to the credit of
Brill.

"Seven runs. That's going some!"

"I guess this is Brill's game, after all."

"Make it a round dozen while you're at it, boys."

But this was not to be. The hits for Brill had evidently come to an
end, and the side retired with seven runs to its credit.

"Now, Tom, hold them down if you possibly can," said Bob, as his team
took the field.

"I'll do my level best, Bob," was the reply.

With the score five to seven against them, Roxley put in a
pinch,hitter by the name of Bixby. This player certainly made good,
getting a three-base hit with apparent ease. Then followed an out, and
then another base hit, bringing in Bixby's run. Then followed some
ragged play on the part of Bob and his second and third basemen, which
put out one man, but evened up the score, 7 to 7.

With two men out, and the score a tie, it was certainly a delicate
position for Tom.

"Tom, hold them! please hold them!" pleaded Bob, as he came up. "Don't
let them get as far as first if you can help it."

The batter to face Tom was a fairly good one, but the young pitcher
remembered that this fellow had always struck at balls which were both
high and far out. Accordingly, he fed him only those which were low
and well in, "One strike!"

"That's it, Tom! Keep it up!"

Again Tom wound up, and the ball shot over the plate. This time the
batsman swung for it, but failed to connect.

"Strike two!"

"Good boy, Tom, that's the way to do it!"

"Be careful, Billy, make him give you just what you want!"

Once again Tom wound up, and this time sent the ball in with all the
speed that was left to him. Again the bat came around.

"Strike three! Batter out!"

A wild yell arose. Here was the end of the ninth inning, and the game
was a tie!

"Oh, Songbird! do you think Brill will win?" exclaimed Grace,
anxiously.

"I certainly hope so. We've pulled up pretty well. We had only two
runs when they had five, remember."

"Hasn't Tom pitched pretty well?" questioned Minnie.

"Sure, he has! Those Roxley fellows are great batters. More than once
they have knocked a pitcher clean out of the box."

"Oh, I certainly hope Brill wins," murmured Nellie.

There was an intense silence when the tenth inning opened. Frank came
to the bat first, and knocked a little one, but managed to reach
first. Then, on a sacrifice hit, he advanced to second. Following
that, came a wild throw by the Roxley pitcher, and Frank dusted as
fast as he could for third.

"Now, Carson, hold him!" yelled a number of the Roxley followers to
their pitcher. "Don't let him get in!"

Carson did his best, but with two strikes called on the batter, there
came a neat little one-base hit, and, amid a wild cheering and a grand
tooting of horns and sounding of rattles, Frank slid in to the home
plate.

"Hurrah! hurrah! that makes the score eight to seven!"

"Keep it up, boys! You've got 'em going."

But that was the end of the run making for Brill. The next man was put
out with ease, and the side retired with the score reading: Roxley--
7, Brill-- 8.

"Now, if we can only hold them," was Spud's comment, as he glanced at
Bob and then at Tom. "How about it?" he demanded, of the pitcher.

"I'll do what I can," was Tom's simple answer.

Nearly all the spectators in the grandstand and on the bleachers were
now on their feet. All sorts of cries and suggestions rent the air.
Amid this great hubbub, the Brill nine took their positions, Sam going
down to left field as directed by Bob.

Tom was a trifle pale as he faced the first batter, but, if he was
nervous, the Roxley player was evidently more so. Almost before either
of them knew it, two strikes had been called. Then, however, came a
short hit to third, which the baseman fumbled, and the batter got
safely to first.

"That's the way! Now, keep it up!"

"We only want two runs to win."

The next batter was one that Tom, fortunately, had studied closely.
This man usually waited all he could in the hope of having balls
called on the pitcher. As a consequence, Tom fed him several straight
ones over the plate, and so quickly that two strikes were called
almost before the baseman realized what was occurring. Then, as he
swung at a low one, the third strike was called, and he was declared
out. In the meantime, however, the runner on first had made second.
Then came another out, and then a drive to second, which landed the
batsman on first, but kept the man on second where he was.

"Two men on base!"

"Bring 'em in, Landy! Bang it out for all you are worth!"

"Careful, Tom, careful!" pleaded Bob; and even Spud came down to
interview the pitcher.

"I'm doing all I can," returned Tom.

It must be admitted that Tom's blood was surging wildly. A miss-- and
the game would either become a tie or be won by Roxley.

In came the ball, and the Roxley player swung at it viciously.

"Strike one!"

"Good boy, Tom, keep it up!"

"Strike him out, old man!"

Again Tom twirled the ball and sent it in. Just the instant before it
left his hand, his foot slipped, and the sphere came in, not on a
curve as the young pitcher had intended, but straight. Crack! went the
bat, and in a twinkling the sphere was sailing high in the air toward
left field.

"Hurrah, that's the way to do it!"

"Run, everybody run!"

"Get it, Sam, get it!"

The ball was high in the air and well over Sam's head. The youngest
Rover was running with might and main down left field. The eyes of all
the spectators were on him. On and on, and still on, he sped, with the
ball curving lower, and lower toward the field. Then, just as the
sphere was coming down, Sam made a wild clutch with his left hand and
caught it.

"Batter out!"

"My, what a catch!"

"Wasn't it a beauty!"

"Brill wins the game!"

Such a riot as ensued! Hats and canes were thrown up into the air,
horns tooted loudly, and the noise of the rattles was incessant. The
Brill students fairly danced for joy, and their friends, including the
ladies, were almost equally demonstrative.

"Sam, that's the best catch I ever saw in my life!" cried Bob, as' he
ran forward to grab the young left-fielder by the hand.

"It certainly was, Sam; and you pulled me out of a big hole," came
from Tom. "When I saw that fellow hit the ball, I thought it was all
up with us."

"Some catch, that!" broke in Spud. And all the others on the nine, and
many of Sam's friends, said the same.

Of course, Roxley was tremendously disappointed at the outcome of the
struggle. Nevertheless, as was usual, she cheered her opponent, and
was cheered in return. Then the two teams broke and ran for the
dressing rooms, and the great crowd of spectators began to slowly
disappear.

"Oh, Sam, that catch was too lovely for anything!" cried Grace, when
the two Rover boys had managed to break away from the rest of the team
and their numerous friends, and had rejoined the girls and Songbird.
"Why, do you know, I was on pins and needles when I saw that ball
coming down and you running after it. I was so afraid you wouldn't get
there in time!"

"Well, I just got it, and no more," returned Sam, modestly.

"He pulled me out of a hole," broke in Tom. "If it hadn't been for
Sam, Roxley would have won the game."

"But you did well, Tom,-- better than our other pitchers would have
done," replied his brother, loyally. "Everybody says so. Why, four or
five of those Roxley hitters can knock the ordinary pitcher clean out
of the box."

"Believe me, there will be some celebration to-night!" vouchsafed
Songbird, as his eyes lit up in expectation. "Bonfires, speeches,
parades, and all that."

"Don't I wish I was a college boy, to be there!" returned Minnie,
wistfully.

"Too bad! but no girls are allowed," returned Sam. "Just the same, I
don't think we'll have to get back to the college very early."

It had already been arranged that the Rovers and Songbird and the
three girls should go off on a little automobile trip after the game.
Grace and Nellie had received permission to be absent from Hope during
the supper hour, and Tom had telephoned to the hotel at Cliffwood,
about twenty miles away, asking the proprietor to reserve a table for
them and prepare dinner for six.

Since Charley's death John Brown had never seen Billy: he had left
the town one woful day an hour after Billy had told him of the discovery
Charley had made. From a far corner of the country he had read the story
of Charley's death; of the futile trial of the river-drivers afterwards,
ending in acquittal, and the subsequent discovery of the theft of
the widows' and orphans' trust-moneys.

On this St. Jean Baptiste's day he was thinking of anything and
everything else but Charley Steele.

Nothing could have been a better advertisement for him than the
perilous incident at the Red Ravine.

Falling backwards when the horse suddenly bolted, his head had struck
the medicine-chest, and he had lain insensible till brought back to
consciousness by the good offices of the voluble Colonel.

He had not, therefore, seen Charley. It was like him that his sense
of gratitude to the unknown tailor should be presently lost in
exploiting the interest he created in the parish. His piebald horse,
his white "plug" hat, his gaily painted wagon, his flamboyant
manner, and, above all, the marvellous tale of his escape from
death, were more exciting to the people of Chaudiere than the
militia, the dancing-bears, the shooting-galleries, or the boat-races.

He could sing extremely well--had he not trained his own choir
when he was a parson? had not Billy approved his comic songs?--and
these comic songs, now sandwiched between his cures and his sales,
created much laughter.

He cured headaches, toothaches, rheumatism, and all sorts of local
ailments "with despatch." He miraculously juggled away pains by what
he called his Pain Paint, and he stopped a cough by a laugh and a
dose of his Golden Pectoral.

In the exuberance of trade, which steadily increased till sundown, he
gave no thought to the tailor, to whom, however, he had sent by a
messenger a two-dollar bill and two bottles of Pain Paint, with the
lordly announcement that he would call in the evening and "present
his compliments and his thanks."

The messenger left the Pain Paint on the door-step of the tailor-shop,
and the two dollars he promptly spent at the Trois Couronnes.

Rosalie Evanturel rescued the bottles from the doorstep and awaited
Charley's return to his shop, that she might take them over to him,
and so have an excuse to speak with him; for to-day her heart and
mind were full of him.

He had done a brave thing for the medicine-man, and had then fled from
public gaze as a brave man should. There was no one to compare with
him.

Not even the Cure was his superior in ability, and certainly he was a
greater man--though seemingly only a tailor--than M. Rossignol. M.
Rossignol--she flushed. Who could have believed that the Seigneur
would say those words to her this morning--to her, Rosalie Evanturel,
who hadn't five hundred dollars to her name?

Sam had secured his
searchlight, but this was hardly needed. One glance at the left-hand
back tire told the story. They had evidently run over something
sharp-- perhaps a piece of glass-- and there was a cut in the shoe at
least three inches long. Through this, the inner tube had blown out
with the report that had so startled them.

"Well, boys, everybody on the job!" cried Tom, and lost no time in
stripping off his coat and donning a jumper, which he carried for use
when working on the car.

"I suppose that's my fault," said Songbird, much crestfallen.

"It might have happened to any of us, Songbird," returned Sam. "Let us
see how quickly we can put on another shoe and inner tube." He, too,
put on a jumper, and in a few minutes the boys had the back axle of
the touring car jacked up.

"You hold the light, Songbird," directed Tom. "Sam and I can do this
work without any help." Then the two Rovers set to work, and in a very
short time the old shoe with its inner tube had been removed. In the
meantime, Songbird had brought out another inner tube, and unstrapped
one of the extra shoes attached to the side of the car, and these were
quickly placed over the wheel rim.

"Now, let me do my share of the pumping," insisted Songbird.

"Nothing doing on that score, Songbird!" replied Tom, quickly. "We had
a new power pump installed last week. I will attach it, and then you
can start up the motor."

"A power pump! Say, that beats hand pumping all to pieces."

"Indeed, it does!" broke in Sam. "I never minded putting on a new
tire, but the pumping-up always came hard."

"Say, this puts me in mind of a story," came from Tom, with a grin.
"Some Germans were going on an automobile tour, and a friend was
bidding them good-bye. Says the friend: 'Uf you haf a blowout, be sure
and haf it in de right place-- at de hotel!'" And at this little joke
there was a general laugh.

Five minutes more found them again on the way, and now Songbird had
the large lights turned on, which made the roadway ahead as bright as
day. He drove as speedily as possible, but with great care, avoiding
everything that looked as if it might harm the tires.

"Oh, what a splendid time I have had!" exclaimed Minnie, as, all too
soon, the Sanderson homestead was reached. Then Songbird assisted her
to alight, and insisted upon accompanying her into the cottage.

"I will wager he would rather stay here than go on to Brill," remarked
Tom, slyly.

"Sure thing!" returned Sam. "Wouldn't we rather remain at Hope than go
to Brill?" And at this pointed remark both of the girls giggled.

Those outside waited for several minutes, and then Tom sounded the
horn loudly. Soon Songbird re-appeared and took his place at the
wheel, and then the automobile was turned in the direction of the
seminary.

"When will we see you again?" remarked Nellie, when the touring car
had been run through the grounds.

"Oh, it won't be very long," replied Tom. But as he spoke, little did
he realize under what peculiar conditions they would come together
again.

"If you hear anything more about that money affair, let us know at
once," whispered Sam to Grace.

"I will, Sam," returned the girl; and a few minutes later the young
folks bade each other a fond good-night, and the touring car turned
towards Brill.

The lads were still some distance from the college grounds when they
heard the sounds of horns and rattles. Then they beheld a glimmer of
light down by the river bank. Soon the light brightened until it
covered a goodly portion of the sky.

"Some bonfires and some noise!" was Sam's comment.

"Well, we don't defeat Roxley every day in the year," returned Tom,
gaily. "Say, this suits me right down to the ground! Songbird, you
ought to get up a poem in honor of the occasion."

"Perhaps I will," answered the would-be poet of the college, and then
he began to murmur to himself. Evidently the poem was already
beginning to shape itself in his fertile mind.

"I say, you Rovers!" came a call as the car swung into the roadway
lining one side of the campus. "What's the matter with giving us a joy
ride?" and one of the students came running forward, followed by
several others. Two of them carried torches made of old brooms dipped
in tar.

"Nothing doing to-night," returned Sam quickly, and added in a whisper
to Tom: "Those fellows would wreck the car completely."

"I know it," answered the older Rover, and then he said aloud: "We
have had all the run we want this evening. We are going to celebrate
with the rest of the crowd down at the river." And without stopping to
argue the matter, Tom ran the automobile to its garage.

"Back, safe an' sound, eh?" questioned Abner Filbury, as he came
forward to take charge of the machine.

"Ab, you look out that some of the fellows don't take this car
to-night," warned Tom.

"There ain't no cars goin' out less'n I've the correct orders for
'em," replied Abner. "This is the last machine in, an' I'm goin' to
lock up an' stay on guard. If anybody tries to break in here against
orders, they'll git a dose of buckshot in 'em." And Abner pointed
grimly at a shotgun that hung on one of the walls.

"Oh, Ab, don't go in for shooting anybody!" exclaimed Sam, in alarm.
"Turn the hose on them, that will be enough."

"All right, jest as you say. But they ain't goin' to git in here at
these machines without permission."

Tom and Sam made a hasty visit to their room, and then hurried
downstairs again and off to the waterfront. Here, several bonfires had
been lit. They were composed of boxes and barrels with a large
quantity of brushwood added, and one bonfire was nearly twenty feet in
height.

"Here they come!" called out a student.

"Hurrah for our pitcher!"

"And the best fly catcher Brill ever saw!"

"Say, this is certainly some bonfire!" exclaimed Sam, looking at the
big blaze.

"It sure is!" returned his brother. "If the wind should shift, it
might prove dangerous," he added, as he watched a great mass of sparks
floating across the stream and over the woods beyond.

"Oh, it's perfectly safe," came from Paul Orben, who was one of the
students who had helped to pile up the combustibles.

The crowd was certainly a gay one, and the Rovers lost no time in
joining in the festivities. One student had a bugle, and another had
an old base drum which boasted of only one head. These two succeeded
in forming a crowd of their fellow-students into marching order, and,
singing gaily and tooting horns and sounding rattles, and with
numerous torches flickering, the collegians tramped around the college
buildings and over the campus and then back to the bonfires.

"Whoop! Hurrah!" came a sudden yell, and from one of the distant barns
rushed half a dozen students, dragging behind them a buggy. On the
seat, wearing an exceedingly tight jockey jacket, and likewise a
jockey cap, sat old man Filbury, the general caretaker of the
dormitories.

"Hurrah! Here the conquering hero comes!"

"It's a race-- a race for a thousand dollars!"

"I'll bet on Filbury, every time!"

"Now, see here, gents, I don't like this at all. You lemme out o' this
here kerridge," wailed the old man-of-all-work. "I ain't doin' none o'
this celebratin'. I got some work to do. You let me go."

"Oh, we couldn't think of it, Filbury," cried Stanley, who was one of
the students at the shafts of the carriage. "Now then, boys,
together!" And along the turnout rattled, past the various bonfires.

"Speech! Speech!" came another cry. "Filbury, can't you say something
about Brill and this glorious victory?"

"Never mind the victory," came from Tom. "Let him tell us about how to
pass our examinations without studying."

"And how to get credit down in town without paying any bills," put in
another student, who, evidently, had hard work making both ends meet.

"I tell you, I ain't a-goin' to make no speech," wailed old Filbury.
"I've got work to do. You lemme go."

"Sam," whispered Tom, catching his brother, by the arm, "what's the
matter with giving William Philander a ride with old Filbury?"

"Just the cheese, Tom!" returned the young Rover. "But how can we do
it?"

The matter was talked over for a short minute, and Spud and Bob were
called in to aid. William Philander Tubbs sat on a small packing case
which had not, as yet, been fed to the flames. He was, as usual,
faultlessly attired, even down to his spats.

Passing the word to those who had charge of the carriage and who were
doing their best to get some fun out of old Filbury, Tom and Sam and
their chums worked their way to a position behind William Philander.
Then came a sudden rush, and the dudish student found himself caught
up and carried bodily over to the carriage, where he was
unceremoniously dumped on the seat beside the old man-of-all-work.

"My gracious me! What does this mean?" gasped the astonished William
Philander. "I don't want any ride, I want you to leave me alone."

"All aboard, everybody!" sang out Tom, and gave the carriage a shove
from behind. Before the dudish student could attempt to leap to the
ground, the turnout was once more in motion and dashing along the
campus roadway as fast as the students could pull and push it.

"Them boys is plumb crazy!" gasped old Filbury.

"Oh, I never! We shall certainly be hurt," wailed William Philander.
And then, as two wheels of the turnout went over a big stone, he
clutched old Filbury wildly by the shoulder. Then the carriage struck
another stone, and both occupants held fast for dear life. Three times
the turnout, with its terrified occupants, circled the campus. All the
while William Philander and old Filbury were yelling wildly for their
tormentors to stop. But now, a long rope had been hitched fast to the
front axle, and fully two dozen students had hold of this, fresh ones
continually taking the places of those who became tired out. As it
was, Sam and Tom went around twice, and then fell out to rest.

"Say, Washer," said a student named Lamar to his close chum, "here's a
chance to square up with old Filbury for the way he treated us."

"What do you mean?" asked the student named Washer.

"Let us get in the lead on the rope, and run the carriage down to the
river."

"Say, that's just the cheese!" chuckled the other. "We'll do it. I
think old Filbury deserves something for reporting us as he did."

On and on went the carriage, but at the turn in the roadway it was
suddenly hauled over the grass and between some bushes.

"Oh, Tom, look! They are heading for the river!" cried Sam.

"All aboard!" yelled Washer. "Now then, straight ahead!" He and Lamar
had headed for the water. Some of the students tried to turn to the
right or the left, but others followed the leaders. In a moment more,
the carriage had reached the sloping bank of the river. Then the crowd
scattered, and a moment later the turnout, with a twist, struck the
water and went over sideways, plunging old Filbury and William
Philander into the stream.

  CHAPTER X

 THE FIRE AT HOPE

"My, what a dive!"

"Everybody to the rescue!"

"Somebody get some life-preservers!"

So the cries arose as the students ran from every direction and lined
the bank of the river, which, at this point, was but a few feet deep.

Old Filbury was the first to reappear, and as he stood up in water and
mud that reached his waist, he shook his fist at his tormentors.

"You'll pay for this!" he cried. "I'll fix yer! I'll have yer all sent
home, you'll see if I don't!"

In the meantime, William Philander had also struggled to his feet. He
had lost his cap, and on the top of his head rested a mass of grass
and mud. He came out of the water spluttering and shaking himself.

"I won't stand this! I'll have you all arrested!" he gasped.

"It was an accident," came from one of the students.

"It was not! It was done on purpose!"

"Sure! it was done a purpose!" roared old Filbury. "I never seen such
goin's on in my life!"

"Never mind, you needed a bath, Filbury," shouted one student. And at
this there was a laugh.

"I am going to report all of you," stormed William Philander. "Look at
this suit, it is ruined!" and he held up the sides of his coat to
view. The water and mud were dripping profusely from the garment.

"Better go down to the gym and get under a shower," suggested Spud.

"I am not. I am going to my room," retorted William Philander. And
then, of a sudden, he took to his heels, burst through the crowd, and
hurried toward one of the college buildings. At the same time, Filbury
started to run for one of the stables.

"Say, Tom, that was rather rough," remarked Sam, after the two had
disappeared.

"It sure was, Sam. I didn't think they would run the carriage into the
water like that."

"It was Washer's and Lamar's fault."

"I know it. They are always out for carrying a joke to the limit. I
suppose they had it in for old Filbury, and they must have had it in
for Tubbs, too."

"I wonder if either of them will make a kick over the way they have
been treated," put in Bob. It may be stated here, that, in the end,
nothing came of the incident. Filbury stormed around a little, and so
did William Philander, but, to their credit be it said, both were
"sports" enough not to take their complaints to the college
management.

All good times must come to an end, and by midnight the bonfires had
burned themselves out, and, one by one, the students retired. The
carriage was righted and taken back to the place where it belonged.

For the best part of a week after this, but little out of the ordinary
occurred. With the excitement attending the close of the baseball
season over, the Rovers applied themselves more diligently than ever
to their studies. During that time they received notes from Grace and
Nellie, stating that nothing new had developed concerning the missing
four-hundred-dollar ring. They also received another letter from Dick,
in which the oldest Rover boy stated that he and the lawyer had made a
final settlement with Pelter, Japson & Company, and that he had heard
that the brokers were about to leave New York City for good.

"By the way, Tom," said Sam, after reading the letter from Dick, "this
puts me in mind: What became of that fellow we hauled out of the
river?"

"The last I heard of him, he was still under the care of Doctor
Havens."

"Don't you think we ought to call on him? He might want to see us."

"If he wanted that, Sam, wouldn't he send us word? Perhaps, if he is
any relation to Jesse Pelter, he would rather we would keep away from
him."

On the following morning a letter came addressed to Tom, and bearing
the Ashton postmark. On opening the communication, he was much
interested to read the following:

  Dear Mr. Rover:

  "I want to thank you and your brother for what you did for me. I
  shall never forget it. Even were I in a position to do so, I would
  not insult you by offering you any reward. These had never
  presented themselves to her in a country, in a parish, where people
  said of fortune and misfortune, happiness and sorrow, "C'est le bon
  Dieu!"--always "C'est le bon Dieu!"
  In some sense it was a pity that she had brains above the ordinary,
  that she had had a good education and nice tastes. It was the
  cultivation of the primitive and idealistic mind, which could
  not rationalise a sense of romance, of the altruistic, by knowledge
of life.

  As she sat behind the post-office counter she read all sorts of
books that came her way.

                             When she learned English so as to read it almost as easily as she
read French, her greatest joy was to pore over Shakespeare, with a
heart full of wonder, and, very often, eyes full of tears--so near
to the eyes of her race.

                                                     Her imagination inhabited Chaudiere with a different folk, living
in homes very unlike these wide, sweeping-roofed structures, with
double windows and clean-scrubbed steps, tall doors, and wide,
uncovered stoops.

Her people--people of bright dreaming--were not quarrelsome, or
childish, or merely traditional, like the habitants. They were picturesque
and able and simple, doing good things in disguise, succouring
distress, yielding their lives without thought for a cause, or a
woman, and loving with an undying love.

Charley was of these people--from the first instant she saw him.

The Cure, the Avocat, and the Seigneur were also of them, but
placidly, unimportantly. "The Sick Man at Jo Portugais' House"
came out of a mysterious distance. Something in his eyes said, "I
have seen, I have known," told her that when he spoke she would
answer freely, that they were kinsfolk in some hidden way.

Her nature was open and frank; she lived upon the house-tops, as
it were, going in and out of the lives of the people of Chaudiere
with neighbourly sympathy and understanding.

Yet she knew that she was not of them, and they knew that, poor as
she was, in her veins flowed the blood of the old nobility of France.

For this the Cure could vouch. Her official position made her the servant
of the public, and she did her duty with naturalness.

She had been a figure in the parish ever since the day she returned
from the convent at Quebec, and took her dead mother's place in
the home and the parish.

She had a quick temper, but there was not a cheerless note in her
nature, and there was scarce a dog or a horse in the parish but
knew her touch, and responded to it.

Squirrels ate out of her hand, she had even tamed two partridges, and
she kept in her little garden a bear she had brought up from a cub.

Her devotion to her crippled father was in keeping with her quick
response to every incident of sorrow or joy in the parish--only
modified by wilful prejudices scarcely in keeping with her
unselfishness.

As Mrs. Flynn, the Seigneur's Irish cook, said of her: "Shure, she's
not made all av wan piece, the darlin'! She'll wear like silk, but
she's not linen for everybody's washin'." And Mrs. Flynn knew a thing
or two, as was conceded by all in Chaudiere.

No gossip was Mrs. Flynn, but she knew well what was going on in the
parish, and she had strong views upon all subjects, and a special
interest in the welfare of two people in Chaudiere. One of these was
the Seigneur, who, when her husband died, leaving behind him a name for
wit and neighbourliness, and nothing else, proposed that she should
come to be his cook.

In spite of her protest that what was "fit for Teddy was not fit for
a gintleman of quality," the Seigneur had had his way, never repenting
of his choice. Mrs.

Flynn's cooking was not her only good point. She had the rarest sense
and an unfailing spring of good-nature--life bubbled round her.

It was she that had suggested the crippled M. Evanturel to the Seigneur
when the office of postmaster became vacant, and the Seigneur had
acted on her suggestion, henceforth taking greater interest in
Rosalie.

It was Mrs. Flynn who gave Rosalie information concerning Charley's
arrival at the shop of Louis Trudel the tailor. The morning after
Charley came, Mrs. Flynn had called for a waistcoat of the Seigneur,
who was expected home from a visit to Quebec.

She found Charley standing at a table pressing seams, and her quick
eye took him in with knowledge and instinct. She was the one person,
save Rosalie, who could always divert old Louis, and this morning
she puckered his sour face with amusement by the story of the
courtship of the widow Plomondon and Germain Boily the horse-trainer,
whose greatest gift was animal-training, and greatest weakness a
fondness for widows, temporary and otherwise.

Before she left the shop, with the stranger's smile answering to her
nod, she had made up her mind that Charley was a tailor by courtesy
only.

"Look there!" cried Tom, pointing with his finger. "Doesn't that look
like a fire?"

"It surely does," replied the other, after a hasty inspection. "But it
may be only some brush heap that a farmer is getting rid of."

"I don't know about that. Say, haven't they got a pair of field
glasses here?"

"Sure!" and Songbird turned to get the article mentioned.

As rapidly as possible, Tom focused the glasses on the distant light,
and took a careful look.

"Great Scott! it's a fire-- and at Hope Seminary!" broke out the
youth. "It looks to me as if the whole place might burn down!"

"What! A fire at Hope!" cried Songbird, and his words attracted the
attention of all the others in the observatory. He, too, took a look
through the glasses, and one after another the remaining students did
the same.

"It certainly is a fire, and at the seminary, isn't it, Tom?"

Tom did not answer. He had already started to leave the building.
Straight down the hill he tore, and then up to the building where he
and the others had their rooms. He burst in on his brother like a
cyclone.

"Sam, come on, quick! There is a fire at the seminary!"

The younger Rover, who was deep in his writing, looked up, startled.

"What is that you said, Tom?"

"I said, hurry up; come along; there is a fire at the seminary! The
girls may be in danger! Come on, let us go there in the auto."

"Oh, Tom, are you sure of this?" And now Sam leaped up, brushing his
writing to one side.

"Yes, I saw the fire from the observatory." And in as few words as
possible, Tom gave his brother the particulars. He was already donning
his automobile outfit. Sam followed suit, and both boys ran downstairs
and to the garage.

By the time they had the touring car ready, Songbird, Stanley, Spud,
and several others had joined them. The word had been passed around
that there was a fire at Hope, and permission to go to the
conflagration was readily granted by the college management.

"All aboard who are going!" sang out Tom, who was at the wheel, with
Sam beside him. Then, after several collegians had climbed into the
tonneau, away the touring car dashed over the road leading to Hope.

  CHAPTER XI

 TO THE RESCUE

It was a wild ride, never to be forgotten. Tom had all the lights
turned up fully, so that he might see everything that was ahead. From
twenty miles per hour the speed climbed up to twenty-five, then
thirty, then thirty-five, and finally forty. Over the newly-mended
bridge they dashed at breakneck speed.

"Be on your guard, Tom," warned Sam.

"We've got to get there," was the grim response. "The girls may be in
danger."

"Right you are! Let her go for all she is worth!"

They had been making many turns and going up-hill and down, but now
came a straight stretch of several miles, and here Tom put on all the
extra power the touring car could command. From forty miles an hour,
they reached forty-five, and then fifty, and, at one point, the
speedometer registered fifty-four.

"My gracious, Tom, don't kill us!" yelled Bob, to make himself heard
above the roar of the motor, for Tom had the muffler cutout wide open.

The youth at the wheel did not answer. He was giving all his attention
to the running of the car, and this was needed. Along the roadway they
sped like an arrow from a bow, past trees and fences, with here and
there a farmhouse or a barn. Once Tom saw a white spot in the road
ahead, and threw off the power. But it was only a flying newspaper,
and on he went as speedily as before.

"It's at Hope, all right!" yelled Stanley, when they slowed down at a
turn of the road.

"Yes, but I don't think it is any of the main buildings," returned
another student.

"I hope not," came from Sam.

There was one more small rise to climb, and then they came into full
view of what was ahead. Through the trees they saw that one of the
large barns, in which the fire had evidently started, was almost
totally consumed. The slight wind that was blowing had carried the
sparks to one of the wings of the main building, and this was now in
flames at several points.

"Here comes the fire engine!" cried Bob, as the touring car swept
through the seminary grounds; and he pointed down the opposite road.
Along this a small engine from a nearby town was approaching, hauled
by a score of men and boys. Far down another road could be heard the
tooting of another engine, probably from some other town.

"We might give some of those fellows help," suggested Songbird.
"What's the matter with running the car down to where they are, and
hitching fast?"

"You can do it, Songbird, if you wish," returned Tom, hurriedly. "I'll
join you just as soon as I find out if the girls are safe."

"And I'll go with Tom," put in Sam.

"Oh, they must be safe; the fire isn't in that part of the building,"
broke in Stanley. "But go ahead, you fellows, we'll take care of the
machine." For he well understood how anxious the Rovers must be
regarding the Laning girls.

Leaping from the touring car, Sam and Tom joined the crowd in the
vicinity of the fire, composed mostly of girl students and their
teachers. About a score of men and boys living in the vicinity had
come up, and these, with the hired help from the institution, were
doing all in their power, to subdue the flames.

"Did all of the girls get out?" asked Tom, of the first teacher he
met.

"I don't know-- I think so," was the answer.

The boys pushed their way along from one group of students to another,
trying to catch sight of those whom they were seeking. In the
meantime, Songbird and the others from Brill had taken charge of the
touring car, and run it down a side road, where they hooked fast to
one of the arriving fire engines, much to the relief of those who had
been dragging the machine over the somewhat rough highway, and were
almost exhausted.

"Oh, Sam!" The cry came from Grace, and the next instant the girl
rushed up and fairly threw herself into the arms of the youngest
Rover.

"Where is Nellie?" he demanded, quickly. "Is she safe?"

"Here I am!" was the call, and then Nellie came up and caught Tom by
the shoulder. "Oh, isn't this dreadful!"

"It sure is, Nellie," returned Tom, as he slipped his arm around her
waist. "But I am mighty glad that you are safe. Do you think everybody
is out?"

"We don't know, but they ought to be out, for we had plenty of
warning. The fire started in the barn, you know."

"What caused it?"

"They think one of the men must have been smoking and dropped a light
in the hay. Anyway, the fire started there."

"The other fellows took the auto to help the fire engine," broke in
Sam. "Here they come now," he added, as the machine came up with
honking horn, and dragging one of the fire engines behind it.

"I wish we could do something to put out this blaze," came from Tom.
"Sam, we must get busy."

"Right you are!"

"Oh, do be careful, both of you!" pleaded Nellie.

"Yes, don't get burnt," added Grace.

"We'll look out, don't you fear," answered Sam, and then he and Tom
turned to join those at the fire engines and the hose carts.

The seminary was provided with several water towers, and from these
some lines of hose had already been run to the fire. Now some
additional lines of hose were laid from the fire engines, which began
to take water from two cisterns. Soon the added streams showed their
effect on the flames.

"Girls! girls! have any of you see Miss Harrow?" The cry came from one
of the teachers, as she made her way through the crowd.

"Why, isn't she out?" asked a number.

"I don't know, I can't find her anywhere," replied the instructor.

"Was she in the building?"

"I think so. She said at supper time that she had a toothache, and was
going to retire early." And thus speaking, the teacher hurried on.

"Is that the Miss Harrow who lost that four-hundred-dollar diamond
ring?" asked Tom.

"Yes," replied Nellie.

"Was her room in that addition?" questioned Sam, quickly, pointing to
an end of the building which was on fire in several places.

"Yes, she has the corner window, right over there," responded Grace,
pointing to a spot close to where the building was in flames.

The words had scarcely left the lips of the girl, when, to the horror
of those standing below, a third story window was suddenly thrown up,
and the head of a woman appeared.

"Help! Help! Save me!" The cry came wildly from the woman, who was
plainly terror-stricken.

"It's Miss Harrow!" cried a score of voices.

"Look! Look! The fire is on both sides of her!"

"Don't jump! Don't jump!" yelled Tom, at the top of his lungs, and he
saw the teacher prepare to cast herself to the ground.

"Can't you come down by the stairs?" called out Sam, as loudly as he
could.

"I'm afraid to open the door! The hall is full of smoke and fire!"
screamed the teacher. "Save me! Save me!"

"Haven't they got a ladder handy?" asked Tom.

"Sure, we've got a ladder-- half a dozen of 'em," responded one of the
men who worked around the place.

"Where is it? Show it to us, quick!" put in Sam.

"All right, this way," returned the man, and started off with Sam at
his heels.

"Don't jump! don't jump! We'll help you!" cried a dozen voices to the
teacher.

"We are going to get a ladder!" yelled Tom. "Stay where you are!"

And then he followed the others. The ladders were kept in a wagon
shed, and it took but a few moments to bring them out. They were four
in number, and of various sizes.

"I'm afraid none of 'em is long enough to reach that winder," said the
man who had led the way.

"You are right," replied Tom. "But what's the matter with lashing a
couple of them together? Here's a rope." And he pointed to a washline
that hung on a nearby hook.

In frantic haste a dozen persons carried the ladders to the burning
building. Tom followed with the rope, which he unwound on the way.
Then the washline was cut, and with it two of the longest ladders were
lashed together as quickly as possible. Then the combination ladder
was raised against the building and set close to the window, to the
sill of which Miss Harrow clung.

"I'll go up if you want me to," cried Tom, as he saw the men who
belonged around the place hold back. "You steady the ladder so it
doesn't slip."

"Want me to help, Tom?" asked Sam.

"No, you see that they steady the ladder." And thus speaking, Tom
began to mount the rungs.

A cheer went up, but to this the youth paid no attention. In a few
seconds he was at the third story window. He had to pass through
considerable smoke, but as yet the flames had not reached that
vicinity.

"Come, give me your hand, and step out on the ladder," cried Tom to
the teacher.

"I-- I can't!" gasped Miss Harrow. And now the youth saw that she was
almost paralyzed from fright. She clung desperately to the window
sill, evidently unable to move. Clinging to the ladder with his left
hand, Tom placed his right foot on the window sill, and then he
reached down and caught the teacher under the arm.

"Come, you don't want to stay here," he ordered, almost sternly, and
pulled the teacher to her feet.

"Oh, oh, we'll fall! I can't do it!" were her gasped-out words.

"You've got to do it-- unless you want to be burned up. Now then, if
you don't want to climb down the ladder, let me carry you."

"I-- I-- oh-- I can't move!" And with these words, the teacher sank
down across the window sill.

A sudden change in the wind drove a cloud of smoke into Tom's face,
and for the moment he and the teacher were hidden from the view of
those below.

"Oh, look! Tom will be burned up!" screamed Nellie.

"No, he won't," returned Sam, reassuringly. "He knows what he is
doing." Nevertheless, Sam was as anxious as anyone over his brother's
safety.

When the smoke shifted, it was seen that Tom had hauled the teacher
from the window sill and had her over his shoulder. She hung down
limply, showing that she had lost consciousness. Rung by rung, the
youth came down the ladder slowly with his burden.

"He's got her! He's got her!" was the glad cry, and a few seconds
later Tom reached the ground, where he was immediately surrounded by
the others.

"Oh, Tom, how did you do it?" cried Nellie, hysterically.

"Oh, it was not much to do-- anybody could have done it," replied the
youth. "Say, what am I to do with her?" he added, indicating the
burden on his shoulder.

"This way, please," said the teacher who had taken charge of matters,
and she led the way out on the campus and to a bench on which some of
the girls had piled their fancy pillows. Here Miss Harrow was made as
comfortable as possible.

By this time a third fire engine had arrived, and more streams were
directed on the flames. The ladder was used by some of those at the
nozzle of one of the hose lines, and by this means the fire in the
wing of the main building was quickly extinguished. Nothing could be
done towards saving what was left of the barn, so the firemen directed
all their efforts towards keeping the conflagration from spreading.

"Well, it's about out," said Sam, a little later. "Some mess, though,
believe me!"

"Oh, I am so thankful it was not worse!" murmured Grace. "Suppose it
had burned down the main building!"

"Tom, you're a hero!" cried Spud, coming up.

"Nothing of the sort," retorted Tom. "Anybody could have done what I
did, and you know it."

"All the same, you're the one who did it," answered Spud, admiringly.

"He certainly did," said one of the men in the crowd. "That teacher
ought to be mighty thankful for what he did for her."

"I don't want her thanks," added Tom, in a low voice. "All I want her
to do, is to treat Nellie fairly."

  CHAPTER XII

 TOM SPEAKS HIS MIND

"Tom, Miss Harrow would like to see you."

It was an hour later, and the Rovers and the Laning girls had spent
the time in watching the efforts of the others to put out the last of
the fire. In the meanwhile, some of those present had gone through the
addition to the main building and opened the various windows and
doors, thus letting out the smoke. An examination proved that the
damage done there was very slight, for which the seminary authorities
were thankful.

"Wants to see me, eh?" returned Tom, musingly. "Well, I don't know
whether I want to see her or not."

"You might as well go, Tom, and have it over with," suggested Sam.

"If I go, I want Nellie to go along," returned the brother. "I want
her to know how I stand on this missing-ring question. By the way, how
is she, all right?" continued the youth, addressing Stanley, who had
brought the news that he was wanted.

"She seems to he all right, although she is very nervous. She says the
reason she didn't hear the alarm and get out of the building in time,
was because she had had a toothache and had taken a strong dose of
medicine to quiet her nerves. Evidently the medicine put her into a
sound sleep."

"How about the toothache?" asked Sam, slyly.

"Oh, that's gone now; the fire scared it away."

"Where is she?" questioned Tom.

"She is in the office with some of the other teachers."

"All right, if I've got to go, I might as well have it over with. Come
along, Nellie."

"Oh, Tom, do you really think I ought to go?"

"If you won't, I won't."

"All right, then," and arm in arm, Tom and Nellie proceeded into the
main building. Nellie showed the way to the office, which was located
at the end of a long corridor.

"Oh, so here is the young gentleman!" cried Miss Harrow, as they
entered. She was very pale, but did her best to compose herself.

"You sent for me?" returned Tom, bluntly.

"Yes. I wish to thank you for what you did for me. You are a very
brave young man. Were I able to do so, I should be only too pleased to
reward you liberally. But I am only a poor teacher, and----"

"I don't want any reward, Miss Harrow. What I did anybody could have
done."

"Perhaps, but----" And now the teacher stopped short, for the first
time noticing Nellie's presence. "What do you want here, Miss Laning?"
she demanded, stiffly.

"I came in with Mr. Rover; he wanted me to come," was the answer. And
as the teacher continued to glare at her, Nellie clung tightly to
Tom's arm.

"I-- I don't understand----" stammered Miss Harrow. She was evidently
much surprised.

"It's this way, Miss Harrow." answered Tom, with his usual bluntness.
"Miss Laning and I have been friends for a great many years. The fact
is, we hope-- that is, I hope"-- and now Tom looked a bit confused--
"we'll be married before a great while. I have been told about the
diamond ring that is missing, and I know all about how you have
treated Nellie. I don't like it at all. I think you are doing her a
great injustice."

"Oh!" The teacher paused abruptly and bit her lip. She glanced from
Tom to Nellie and then to the others who were in the office. "I-- I
have not accused Miss Laning of anything," she went on, rather lamely.

"Perhaps not in so many words. But you have acted as if you felt
certain she was guilty. Now, that isn't fair. She wouldn't touch
anything that wasn't her own. It's a terrible thing to cast suspicion
on any one. What would you say if I were to intimate you had taken the
four-hundred-dollar ring?"

"Sir!" and now the teacher's face grew red. "Do you mean to insult
me?"

"Not at all. But I mean to stand up for Miss Laning first, last, and
all the time," replied Tom, earnestly. "I think it is an outrage to
even suspect her."

For a few seconds there was an intense silence, broken only by a
certain nervous movement among the others in the office. Miss Harrow
bit her lip again.

"I-- I am sorry if I have done Miss Laning an injustice," she said,
slowly. "But the diamond ring is gone, and if the ring is not
recovered, I may be held responsible for it."

"Now, my dear Miss Harrow, pray do not agitate yourself too much,"
broke in another of the teachers. "This is all very painful. You had
better drop the matter."

"I am willing to drop it," answered Tom, before Miss Harrow could
speak. "Only I want it understood that Miss Laning is to be treated
with the consideration she deserves. Otherwise I may suggest to her
father that she be taken away from this institution and a suit for
damages be instituted."

"Oh, no! Not that! Not that!" came from Miss Harrow, and now she was
plainly much frightened. "I did not accuse Miss Laning of anything,
and I do not accuse her now. The ring is missing. That is all I can
say about it."

"I think we had better go, Tom," whispered Nellie.

"You may leave, Miss Laning," said one of the other teachers. "We have
had trouble enough for one night."

"Nellie started for the door, and Tom did the same; but before the
youth could leave, Miss Harrow clutched him by the arm.

"Mr. Rover, just a word," she said in a low voice. "You did me a great
service and I shall not forget it. If I have done Miss Laning an
injustice, I am very sorry for it." And having thus spoken, she turned
back and sank down on a couch. Tom and Nellie left and hurried to the
campus, where they were speedily rejoined by Sam and Grace.

"How did you make out?" asked the younger Rover. And then Tom gave the
particulars of what had occurred.

"Oh, Tom, I am glad you said what you did," cried Grace, heartily.
"Now, maybe, Miss Harrow will be more careful in her actions."

"Well, I simply said what I thought," answered Tom. "They are not
going to lay anything at Nellie's door if I can help it."

"Oh, Tom, but you told them that-- that And Nellie grew red and could
not go on.

"Well, what if I did? It's the truth, isn't it?"

"What was that?" asked Sam, curiously.

"Why, I told them that Nellie and I had been friends for years and
that, sooner or later, we were going to be married."

"You did!" shrieked Grace. "Oh, Tom Rover!"

"Folks might as well know it," returned Tom. "They've got to know it
when the affair comes off."

"Don't you think it's about time you boys started back for college?"
came from Nellie, who was blushing deeply over the personal turn which
the conversation had taken.

"Oh, there's no great rush," answered Tom, coolly.

Nevertheless, now that the conflagration was over, it was thought best
by all the students to get back to the college, so a little later the
crowd was rounded up by Spud and Stanley, and all climbed into the
automobile. Sam ran the car, and the return was made without special
incident.

"Say, Tom, if that wedding is to come off so soon, perhaps I had
better be saving up for a wedding present," remarked Sam, dryly, when
the two brothers were retiring for the night.

"I wouldn't advise you to start saving up just now," answered his
brother. "Better get some sleep first." And then he playfully shied a
pillow at Sam's head.

The next day nearly all the talk at Brill was about the fire and what
Tom had done towards rescuing Miss Harrow. Many insisted upon it that
Tom had enacted the part of a real hero, and he was interviewed by a
local reporter, and a number of newspapers printed quite an item about
the conflagration and the part he had played.

But the students had little time just now for anything outside of
their final examinations. Many papers had to be prepared, and poor Tom
often wondered how he would ever get through with any satisfaction,
either to himself or his instructors. With Sam, the task seemed much
easier, for, as Dick had once declared, Sam was "a regular bookworm,"
and no studies seemed to worry him in the least.

"If I get through at all, I shall be lucky," vouchsafed Tom, after
passing in a particularly hard paper.

"We'll hope for the best," returned Sam.

During those days came another letter from Dick, in which he stated
that he had moved into the offices vacated by Pelter, Japson &
Company, and was doing his best to get everything into working order.
He added that, on the request of their father, he had disposed of some
stocks, and in their stead, had purchased sixty-four thousand dollars'
worth of bonds.

"My, that's some bonds!" remarked Sam, on reading the letter.

"Well, bonds are usually much safer than stocks, even if they don't
pay so well," answered Tom.

There was a letter from their Aunt Martha, who stated that their
father did not seem to be quite as well as he had been the week
previous. She added that they had called in another doctor, who had
stated, after an examination, that there was no cause for alarm-- that
Mr. Rover must be kept quiet and not worried, and probably, he would
be his old self in another month or two.

"I am glad that the college is to shut down soon," said Sam, when he
and his brother were discussing this communication. "I want to see dad
and make sure things are not worse than Aunt Martha pictures them."

"Exactly the way I feel about it, Sam. They may be holding back
something on us just so we won't be worried."

Two days later came the final examination for, both the Rovers, and
they felt much relieved. Songbird was also "out of the woods," as he
expressed it, and asked them if they did not want to join him and Spud
in a short row on the river.

"That suits me," cried Tom. "I want to get out into the air somewhere.
I am done with classrooms forever. If it was not for the look of
things, I would be turning handsprings on the campus."

"Ditto," added Sam.

"Well, come on," said Songbird. And a few minutes later the four
students were down at the boathouse, getting out one of the four-oared
boats.

"Say, Songbird, I should think this would put you in the rhyming
fever," said Sam, as the four lads rowed out on the river.

"It does," returned the would-be poet.

"All right, turn on the verse spigot and let us have the latest
effusion," cried Tom, gaily.

"The verses aren't finished yet," answered Songbird. And then resting
his oar, he drew from his pocket a slip of paper and began to read:

  "The term is passed,
   Away we cast
      Our books and papers with great glee.
   No more we'll train
   Each tired brain----"

  "Instead, we'll cheer because we're free!"

concluded Tom.

"Say, that isn't half bad," broke out Songbird, enthusiastically. "I
was going to put in something about flee----"

"For gracious sake! What have fleas to do with this poetry?"
interposed Tom.

"Fleas! Who said anything about fleas?" snorted Songbird. "I said
'flee,' f-l-e-e."

"Oh, I see!" That's the flee that fled, not the flea who refuses to
flee," went on Tom. And at this sally, the other boys laughed.

"Never mind, give us the rest of it," put in Spud.

"There isn't any 'rest'-- not yet," answered the would-be poet. And
then the bays resumed the row up the river.

  CHAPTER XIII

 AT THE FARM

"All aboard who are going! We haven't any time to spare if you want to
catch that nine-fifteen train."

"Good-bye, Tom, don't forget to write."

"Say, Spud, when you get down to the Maine coast, don't eat too many
lobsters."

"And that puts me in mind, Stanley. When you reach the Grand Canyon,
send me a piece of rock; I want to see how the Canyon looks."

"Say, whose baseball mitt is this anyway?" And following this
question, the mitt came sailing through the air, to land on the floor
of the Brill carryall.

"Please get off of my feet!" The wail came from William Philander
Tubbs, who was sitting in a corner with another student partly on his
lap.

"Everybody shove, and we'll be off!" cried another student, merrily.

Then came a great mixture of cries and whistles, intermingled with the
tooting of horns and the sounding of rattles, in the midst of which
there moved from the Brill grounds several carriages and an equal
number of automobiles.

The term had come to an end, and the students were preparing to
scatter. The majority were going home, but others had planned to go
directly to the summer resorts where they were to spend their
vacations.

"Good-bye, Brill!" sang out Tom, and, for once, his voice was a trifle
husky. Now that he was leaving the college not to return, a sudden
queer sensation stole over the youth. He looked at his brother, and
then turned his gaze away.

"Never mind, Tom," said Sam, softly. "If I come back, as I expect,
you'll have to come and visit me."

Hope Seminary was not to close until the week following, and the
evening before the Rovers had visited Grace and Nellie. From them, Sam
and Tom had heard news that interested them greatly. This was to the
effect that Dora had invited her cousins to visit her in New York City
some time during the vacation.

"That will be fine!" Tom had cried. "You come when Sam and I are
there, and we'll do all we can to give you the best kind of a time."
And so it had been arranged.

The boys and their friends were in the Rover touring car. This
machine, it had been decided, was to remain at the college garage, in
care of Abner Filbury. Abner was now driving, so that the boys were at
liberty to do as they pleased.

"Let's give 'em a song," suggested Stanley, and the boys sang one
college song after another, the tunes being caught up by those in the
other turnouts. Thus they rolled up to the railroad station in Ashton.
Then the train came in, and all the young collegians lost no time in
getting aboard.

"Where are you going, my dear William Philander?" asked Tom, of the
dudish student, who sat in front of him.

"I am going to Atlantic City," was the somewhat stiff reply, for
William Philander had not forgotten the ducking in the river.

"Atlantic City!" exclaimed Tom. "Of course, you are not going in
bathing?"

"To be sure I am! I have a brand new bathing suit ordered. It is dark
blue, with pin stripes running----"

"But see here, Billy! If you go in bathing at Atlantic City this
season, you'll be chewed up."

"What do you mean?" And now the dudish student seemed interested.

"Haven't you heard about the sea serpents they have seen at Atlantic
City?" demanded Tom,-- "four or five of them." And he poked Sam, who
sat beside him, in the ribs; and also winked at Spud, who was in the
seat with William Philander.

"That's right, Tubbs," put in Sam. "Why, they say some of those sea
serpents are twenty feet long."

"Oh, yes, I heard about them, too," added Spud, and now he braced
himself for one of his usual yarns. "Why, they tell me that one
afternoon the sea serpents came in so thickly among the bathers that
it was hard for them-- I mean those in bathing-- to tell which was
sand and which was serpents. Some of the serpents crawled up on the
boardwalk, and even got into some of the stores and hotels. They had
to order out the police, and then the fire department, and, finally,
some of the soldiers had to come down from the rifle ranges with a
Gatling gun. You never heard of such a battle! Somebody said they
killed as many as ninety-seven sea serpents, and not less than three
hundred got away. Why, William Philander, I wouldn't go within
twenty-five miles of Atlantic City if I were you," concluded Spud.

"Oh, how ridiculous!" responded the dudish student. Nevertheless, he
looked much worried. "Of course, they do report a sea serpent now and
then."

"Well, you haven't got to believe it, Billy," answered Tom. "At the
same time, you'll be a fine specimen of a college boy if you come back
next Fall minus an arm and a leg. How on earth are you going to any of
the fashionable dances in that condition?" And at this, there was a
general snicker, in the midst of which William Philander arose, caught
up his dresssuit case, and fled to another car.

"You can bet that will hold William Philander for awhile," remarked
Sam. "He won't dare to put as much as a toe in the water at Atlantic
City until he is dead sure it is safe."

"Humph! William Philander isn't one of the kind to go into the water,"
sniped Tom. "He belongs to the crowd that get into fancy bathing
costumes, and then parades up and down on the sand, just to be
admired."

It was not long before the Junction was reached, and here the Rovers
had to part from a number of their friends. A fifteen-minute wait, and
then their train came along. It was not more than half full, so the
students had all the room they desired.

"I must say, the farm will look pretty good to me," remarked Tom, when
the time came for them to collect their belongings.

"I want to see dad," returned his younger brother.

"Oh, so do I."

"Oak Run! All out for Oak Run!" It was the well-known cry of the
brakeman as the train rolled into the station where the Rovers were to
alight.

"Good-bye, everybody!" sang out both Sam and Tom, and, baggage in
hand, they hurried to the station platform. Then the train went on its
way, leaving them behind.

The boys had sent a message ahead, stating when they would arrive,
and, consequently, Jack Ness, the hired man, was on hand with the
family touring car.

"Back safe and sound, eh? Glad to see yer!" cried the hired man, as
they approached, and he touched his cap.

"And we are glad to be back, Jack," returned Tom, and added quickly:
"How is my father?"

"Oh, he's doin' as well as can be expected, Mr. Tom. The doctors say
he has got to keep quiet. Your Aunt Martha said to warn both of you
not to excite him."

"Is he in bed?" questioned Sam.

"Not exactly. He sits up in his easy chair. He can't do much walkin'
around."

While talking, the boys had thrown their belongings into the car. Tom
took the wheel, with Sam beside him, leaving the hired man to get in
among the baggage. Then away they rolled, over the little bridge that
spanned the river and connected the railroad station with the village
of Dexter's Corners. Then, with a swerve that sent Jack Ness up
against the side of the car, they struck into the country road leading
to Valley Brook Farm, their home.

"Looks good, doesn't it?" remarked Sam, as they rolled along, past
well-kept farms and through a pleasant stretch of woodland.

"Yes, it looks good and is good," returned Tom, with satisfaction.
"The college and the city are all right enough, Sam, but I don't go
back on dear old Valley Brook!"

"How the country around here has changed since the time when we moved
here," went on Sam. "Do you remember those days, Tom?"

"Do I remember them? Well, I guess! And how Uncle Randolph used to be
annoyed at what we did." And Tom smiled grimly.

Another turn or two, and they came in sight of the first of the farm
fields. Then they reached the long lane leading to the commodious
farmhouse, and Tom began to sound the automobile horn.

"There is Uncle Randolph!" cried Sam, pointing to the upper end of the
lane.

"Yes, and there is Aunt Martha," added Tom, as a figure stepped out on
the farmhouse piazza. Then both of the boys waved their hands
vigorously.

"Back again, eh!" cried Uncle Randolph, when the car had been brought
to a stop. "Glad to see you, boys," and he shook hands.

"Back again, and right side up with care!" exclaimed Tom. He made one
leap up the piazza steps, and caught his aunt in his arms. "How are
you, Aunt Martha? Why, I declare, you are getting younger and better
looking every day!" and he kissed her heartily.

"Oh, Tom, my dear, don't smother me!" gasped the aunt. Yet she looked
tremendously pleased as she gazed at him. Then Sam came in for a hug
and a kiss.

"You mustn't be too boisterous," whispered Uncle Randolph, when all
started to enter the house. "Remember, your father isn't as strong as
he might be."

"Where is he?" both boys wanted to know.

"He is up in the wing over the dining-room," answered their aunt. "We
thought that would be the nicest place for him. The window has a fine
outlook, you'll remember."

"Can we go up now?" questioned Tom.

"Yes, but remember, do not say anything to excite him

"All right, we'll be careful," came from Sam. And then both lads cast
aside their caps and hurried up the stairs.

Mr. Anderson Rover sat in an easy chair, attired in his dressing gown.
He looked thin and pale, but his face lit up with a smile as his eyes
rested on his two sons.

"Dad!" was the only word each could utter. And then they caught him by
either hand, and looked at him fondly.

"I am glad to see you back, boys," said their father, in a low but
clear voice. "It seems like a long while since you went away."

"And we have missed you a great deal!" broke out Sam. It's too bad you
don't feel better."

"Oh, I think I'll get over it in time," answered Mr. Rover. "But the
doctors tell me I must go slow. I wouldn't mind that so much, if it
wasn't for Dick. I think he ought to have some help."

"Now, don't you worry, Dad," interposed Tom, gently. "You just leave
everything to us. We are both going to New York to help Dick
straighten out matters, and it will be all right, I am sure." And he
stroked his father's shoulder affectionately.

"But you'll have to go back to college----" began the invalid.

"Sam is going back. I am going to help Dick, and stay with him. Now,
don't say anything against it, Dad, for it is all settled," went on
Tom, as his father tried to speak again. "I don't care to go back. I
think Dick and I were cut out for business men. Sam is the learned
member of this family."

"Well, boys, have your own way; you are old enough to know what you
are doing." And now Mr. Rover sank back in the chair, for even this
brief conversation had almost exhausted him.

  CHAPTER XIV

 A STARTLING SCENE

"Dear old dad! Isn't it awful to see him propped up in that chair,
unable to leave his room!"

"You are right, Sam. And yet it might be worse-- he might be confined
to his bed. I hope we didn't excite him too much."

"He was very much surprised at your determination to give up Brill,
and join Dick. I guess he was afraid Dick would have to shoulder the
business alone. And by the way, Tom," went on the youngest Rover,
earnestly, "somehow it doesn't seem just right to me that I should put
all this work off on you and Dick."

"Now, don't let that bother you, Sam. You can go to New York with me
this Summer, and then you go back to college, and come out at the head
of the class. That will surely please us all."

This conversation took place while the two boys were retiring for the
night. They had not remained very long with their father, fearing to
excite him too much. Aunt Martha had, as usual, had a very fine repast
prepared for them, and to this, it is perhaps needless to state, the
youths did full justice.

"It's a grand good thing that we have Aleck Pop with us," went on Sam,
referring to the colored man, who, in years gone by, had been a waiter
at Putnam Hall, but who was now firmly established as a member of the
Rover household. "Aunt Martha says he waits on dad, hand and foot;
morning, noon and night."

"Well, Aleck ought to be willing to do something for this family in
return for all we have done for him," answered Tom.

Despite the excitement of the day, the two boys slept soundly. But
they were up at an early hour, and, after breakfast, took a walk
around the farm in company with their Uncle Randolph, who wished to
show them the various improvements he had made.

"We have a new corncrib and a new root hovel," said their uncle, as
they walked around. "And next week we are going to start on a new
pigsty."

"Going to have one of those new up-to-date, clean ones, I suppose?"
returned Sam.

"Yes. I do not think that it is at all necessary to keep pigs as dirty
as they are usually kept," returned Uncle Randolph.

"Say, Uncle," put in Tom, with a sudden twinkle in his eye, "are you
going to sell pork by the yard after this?"

"By the yard?" queried Uncle Randolph, and then a faint smile
flickered over his face. "Oh, I see! You mean sausage lengths, eh?"

"Not exactly, although that is one way of selling pork by the yard,"
returned Tom. "I was thinking of what happened in our college town.
One of the boys went into a butcher's shop, and asked for a yard of
pork, and the butcher handed out three pig's feet."

"Oh, what a rusty joke, Tom!" exclaimed Sam.

"Well, I didn't ask for the yard of pork; it was Dobson who did that,"
returned Tom, coolly.

Having inspected the various improvements, the boys returned to the
house, and then went upstairs for another short talk with their
father. In the midst of this, the family physician arrived. When he
had waited on the invalid, the boys called the doctor to one side, and
asked him to tell them the truth regarding their parent.

"Oh, I think he'll pull through all right," said the doctor. "But as I
have told your uncle and your aunt, he must be kept quiet. If you talk
business to him, or excite him in any way, it is bound to make matters
worse."

"Then we'll keep him just as quiet as possible," returned Tom. "If
anything unusual occurs in his business, we won't let him know
anything about it."

"That would be best," answered the doctor, gravely; and took his
departure.

Several days passed, and by that time the boys felt once more quite at
home. Once they went out in the touring car, taking their aunt and
uncle along.

"It's too bad we can't take dad," was Sam's comment, "but the doctor
says it won't do. We'll have to leave him in charge of Aleck." The
ride proved a most enjoyable one, and the older folks were much
pleased by it.

"What do you say, Tom, if we go down to the river and have a swim?"
proposed Sam, the next morning. It was an unusually hot day, and the
thought of getting into the cool water of the old swimming hole
appealed strongly to the youth.

"Suits me," returned his brother. "We haven't had a swim down there
since last year."

"You young gents want to be careful about that there swimmin' hole,"
put in Jack Ness, who had heard the talk.

"Why, what's the matter now, Jack?"

"I dunno, exactly, but I hear some of the fellers sayin' as how that
swimmin' hole wasn't safe no more. I think it's on account of the tree
roots a growin' there."

"We'll be on our guard," answered Sam, and a little later the two lads
set off. It was a long walk over the fields and through the patch of
woods skirting the stream, and on arriving at the old swimming hole,
Sam and Tom were glad enough to rest awhile before venturing into the
water. As my old readers know, the stream was a swiftly-flowing one,
and the water was rather cool.

"Remember the day we flew over this way in the biplane?" said Tom.
"That sure was some adventure!"

"Yes, but it wasn't a patch to the adventure we had when the biplane
was wrecked," returned his brother, referring to a happening which has
been related in detail in "The Rover Boys in New York."

Having rested awhile, the two boys started to get ready for their
swim. Both had just thrown off their coats, when there came a sudden
cry from up the river.

"What's that, Tom?" questioned Sam.

"Somebody is calling. Listen!" and then both boys strained their ears
for what might follow.

"There! Stay where you are! Don't move!"

"I can't stay here," said another voice.

"Shall I shoot him now?" put in a heavy bass voice.

"No, wait a minute, I am coming over," said still another voice, and
then there was silence. The Rover boys looked at each other in
amazement. What did the talk mean?

"Say, sounds to me as if somebody was in trouble!" exclaimed Sam.

"Perhaps we had better go and see," returned Tom.

"All right, but we don't want to get into trouble ourselves. Those
fellows, whoever they are, or at least one of them, seems to be
armed."

"We'll take a few stones along, Sam, and a couple of sticks, too, if
we can find them."

Stones were to be had in plenty, and having picked up several of them,
and cast their eyes around for a couple of clubs, the lads lost no
time in making their way towards the spot from whence the voices had
proceeded. This was at a point where the river made a turn and was
divided by a long, narrow island into two channels. The island was
covered with brushwood, while the banks of the stream were lined with
overhanging trees.

"Now, I am going to shoot him!" cried one of the voices which the boys
had heard before.

"No, don't do it, just wait a minute!" answered some one else.

"Maybe they have got some poor fellow, and have robbed him," suggested
Sam, as he and his brother hurried forward as quickly as the trees and
tangled brushwood would permit.

"One thing is certain, that fellow, whoever he is, is in trouble,"
returned Tom. "Perhaps we had better yell to those other fellows to
stop."

"If we do that, they may shoot the poor chap, and then run away."

"That's so, too! Well, come ahead, let's hurry and see if we can catch
sight of them." And then the two boys pushed ahead faster than ever.

Presently the youths came to where there were a number of high rocks
covered with trailing vines. As, to avoid these, it would have been
necessary to wade in the stream, and thus get their shoes and
stockings wet, they began to scramble over the rocks with all possible
speed.

"Listen! They are talking again!" exclaimed Sam.

"Grab him! Grab him by the throat!"

"That's all right, Jim, but I don't want the boat to upset," growled
another voice.

"Say, you fellows make me tired!" roared the heavy bass voice. "Do you
want to keep us here all day?"

"What do you know about this gun? Maybe it will explode."

"Say, Sam, I don't know what to make of this!" panted Tom, who was
almost out of breath from the violence of his exertion.

"Maybe they are tramps, and are holding somebody up. Anyway, it sounds
bad," returned his brother.

Hauling themselves at last to the top of the rocks, the Rover boys
looked ahead. Down in the swiftly-flowing stream, they saw a
flat-bottom boat containing two men. One man, a tall, burly
individual, had a much smaller fellow by the throat, and was bending
him backward. Close at hand, on the shore, stood another man, gun in
hand, and with the weapon aimed at the burly individual.

"Now then, shoot!" yelled somebody from the shore of the island
opposite, and an instant later the gun went off with a bang. As the
report died away, the burly man in the boat relaxed his hold on the
other fellow, threw up his arms, and fell over into the river with a
loud splash.

  CHAPTER XV

 A TELEGRAM OF IMPORTANCE

The Rover boys were horrified by what they saw, and for the instant
they neither moved nor spoke. They saw the small man in the boat look
over the side into the stream where his assailant had plunged from
sight, then this fellow caught up a single oar that remained in the
craft, and commenced to paddle quickly to shore.

"Oh, Tom, they have killed him!" gasped Sam, on recovering from the
shock.

"It certainly looks like it, Sam," returned Tom. "If he wasn't shot
dead, he must be drowned. Come on!" and, heedless of possible danger,
Tom scrambled down from the rocks and hurried towards the men, with
Sam close behind him. They had not yet reached the pair. on the river
bank, when, to their amazement, they saw the burly individual who had
gone overboard, reappear at a point further down the stream. He was
swimming lustily for shore.

"Hello! He can't he so badly hurt!" exclaimed Tom. "Look at him strike
out!"

"Maybe he was only scared, and went overboard to escape a second
shot," suggested Sam.

"Hi! you fellows over there!" yelled the man who carried the gun. "Was
that all right?"

"It looked so to me, although you were a little slow about it," came
from the shore of the island; and now, glancing in that direction, Sam
and Tom saw two men. One had what looked to be a megaphone in his
hand, and the second stood behind a high, thin camera with a handle
attached, set on a tripod. At the sight of the camera, both youths
stopped short. Then Tom looked at his brother and began to snicker.

"Sold! What do you think of that, Sam?"

"Why, they are only taking a moving picture!" exclaimed the younger
Rover. "Talk about a sell, Tom! That's one on us."

"Don't let them know how we were sold," returned the brother, quickly.
"If it leaked out we'd never hear the end of it."

"Right you are! Mum's the word!" And it may be added here that the
boys kept their word, and said nothing to those at home about how they
had been fooled.

By the time they reached the man in the boat and the fellow with the
gun, the individual who had gone overboard was coming up the river
bank, dripping water with every step.

"Say, was that all right?" he demanded, as he stripped off his coat
and wrung the water from it. "I hope it was, because I don't want to
go through that again, not even for the extra five dollars."

"So you are taking moving pictures," remarked Tom, pleasantly. "That
was sure a great scene."

"Oh, so you saw it, did you?" returned the man with a gun. "I thought
we were here all alone," and he did not seem to be particularly
pleased over the boys' arrival.

"Going to take some more pictures here?" questioned Sam.

"That's our business," answered the man in the boat, crustily.

"Well, maybe it's ours, too," returned the youngest Rover, quickly,
not liking the manner in which he had been addressed. "This land
belongs to my folks."

"Oh, is that it?" cried the man, and now he looked a bit more
pleasant. "Are you the Rovers?"

"Yes."

"No, we are about done with our picture taking in this vicinity,"
continued the man in the boat. The next picture in this series is to
be at the railroad station at Oak Run."

"Say, I would like to get into some of those movies," remarked Tom. "I
imagine it would be a lot of fun."

"Not if you've got to go overboard as I did," grumbled the man who was
wet. "Talk about the strenuous life, this takes the cake! Why, in the
past ten days, I have gone over a cliff, rescued two women from a
burning tenement house, climbed a rope hanging from a burning balloon,
and fallen off a moving freight car. Can you beat that for action?"

"Certainly some stunts!" answered Tom. "But one must get a lot of fun
out of it."

"Oh, sure! Especially when one of the women you are saving from the
burning house gets nervous for fear the flames will reach her, and
grabs you by the ear and nearly pulls it off," growled the moving
picture actor.

"Say!" yelled the man with the megaphone. "Aren't you coming over here
to get us?"

"Of course," returned the man in the boat, hastily. "Bill, give me
that other oar," he went on, and having secured the blade, he lost no
time in rowing over to the island. In the meanwhile, the fellow with
the camera had dismounted the moving picture machine and folded up the
tripod, and was ready to depart.

"Would you mind telling me what this picture is going to be called?"
asked Sam. "We would like to know so, if we see it advertised
anywhere, we can take a look at it."

"This is scene twenty-eight from 'His Last Chance,'" answered the man
with the gun.

"All right, we'll take a chance on 'His Last Chance' when we get the
chance," answered Tom with a grin, and at this play on words the
moving picture men smiled. Soon they had packed all their belongings,
and, getting into the boat, they started down the stream for a landing
some distance below.

"We're a fine set of heroes," remarked Sam, grinningly, as he and Tom
walked back in the direction of the swimming hole. "Wouldn't it have
been rich if we had rushed in to save that fellow in the boat, and
spoiled the picture."

"Don't mention it, Sam," pleaded Tom. "That sure was one on us." And
then both laughed heartily over the way they had been fooled.

Reaching the swimming hole, it did not take the youths long to get
into the water. Remembering what Jack Ness had said about being
careful, they moved around cautiously.

"Here is a tree root that ought to be removed," remarked Sam, after
diving down. "A fellow could easily catch fast on it."

"Maybe we had better put up a danger sign," suggested his brother, and
getting out a note book he carried, he tore a page from it and wrote
as follows:

                               DANGER!

                     Look Out for the Tree Roots!

"There! That ought to do some good," he went on, as he pinned the
notice fast to the nearest tree trunk. The boys enjoyed their swim
thoroughly. They indulged in many monkey-shines, and also had a little
race to the opposite bank and back. This race was won by Tom, but Sam
proved a very close second.

"Now then, I guess we had better hurry home, or we may be late for
lunch," said Sam, after consulting his watch. "It is quarter of
twelve."

Much refreshed, the lads started back for the farmhouse. They were
still some distance away when they saw Jack Ness hurrying towards
them.

"I say, gents!" called out the hired man. "You're wanted at the house
right away."

"What's the matter, Jack?" demanded Tom, quickly. "Is father worse?"

"No, it ain't that, Master Tom. It's a telegram what come for you."

"A telegram?" repeated Sam. "Do you know where it is from?"

"Your uncle said it was from Mr. Dick."

"Then there must be important news," said Tom, and without further
words both youths started on a swift gait for the house. Their aunt
and uncle saw them coming, and ran out on the back porch to meet them.
Their aunt held up her hand warningly.

"Now don't make any noise, boys," she pleaded. "We must not disturb
your father."

"What is it? What's the news?"

"It's a telegram from Dick," answered their Uncle Randolph. "I can't
quite make it out, but, evidently, it is very important. Here it is."

He fumbled in the pocket of his coat, and brought forth the yellow
envelope and handed it to Tom. Taking out the telegram, the youth read
it, with Sam looking over his shoulder. It ran as follows:

  "If possible, I want Sam and Tom to come to New York at once. Very
  important. Do not alarm father.

                                                     "Richard Rover."

"What do you make of this, Tom?" asked Sam, after he had read the
telegram several times.

"I don't know what to make of it, Sam. But one thing is certain: Dick
needs us. Something out of the ordinary has happened."

"That is just what I think, boys," put in their uncle. "Maybe I had
better go with you," he added, nervously.

"No, no, Randolph. You stay here with me," pleaded his wife. "The boys
can attend to the New York matters better than you can." She knew her
husband well, and realized that he was decidedly backward when it came
to the transaction of business matters of importance. He was wrapped
up in his books and his theories about scientific farming and was a
dreamer in the largest sense of that word.

"Very well, my dear, just as you say," answered the uncle, meekly.

"Boys, you won't disturb your father, will you?" continued their Aunt
Martha, anxiously. "You know the doctor said he must not be disturbed
under any circumstances."

"Have you told him about this telegram?" questioned Sam.

"Not a word."

"Then we had better keep still. We can tell him that we want to go to
New York just to see Dick and Dora," put in Tom. And so it was
arranged.

By consulting a new timetable, the boys found they could make a good
railroad connection for the metropolis by taking a train that left Oak
Run at three-thirty o'clock. This would give them about three hours in
which to get lunch, pack their suitcases, and bid good-bye to their
father.

Mr. Rover was somewhat surprised when his sons told him that they were
going to New York to see Dick and his newly-made wife, but they
smoothed matters over by stating that they found it rather dull on the
farm.

"We'd like to go if you can spare us," said Sam.

"Oh, yes, boys, go by all means if you would like to," returned Mr.
Rover, quickly. "I can get along very well. Your Aunt Martha is a
splendid nurse-- and you mustn't forget that I have Aleck."

"An' you can depend upon Aleck, ebery time, sah," put in the colored
man, with a broad grin that showed all of his ivories.

"We are going to try to surprise Dick," said Tom. "We are going to
take the afternoon train." And then, after a few more words with their
father, and without letting him suspect in the least why they were
going to New York, the two lads bade him an affectionate farewell and
left the room.

"Better take a good supply of clothing along, Sam," remarked Tom, when
they were packing up. "There is no telling how long we'll have to
remain in the city."

"What do you suppose it is all about, Tom?" questioned the younger
brother, anxiously.

"It's about business, that's certain. More than likely Dick has run
into more trouble." But how great that trouble was, neither of the
boys realized.

  CHAPTER XVI

 THE MOVING PICTURE

When the two Rover boys arrived at the railroad station at Oak Run,
they were a little surprised to find themselves once more confronted
by the moving picture people they had met on the river.

"Hello! So you are following us up, are you?" said the man who had
handled the gun. But he smiled as he spoke, because he saw that the
boys carried dresssuit cases and were equipped for traveling.

"Have you taken your picture of the railroad station yet?" questioned
Tom.

"We've had one scene in front of the ticket office," returned the man.
"But our main scene we shall pull off when the train comes in-- or
rather, when it pulls out."

"Perhaps you'll want us in it, after all," broke in Sam.

"See here! If you fellows want to get in this picture, just say so and
I guess I can arrange it," said the man who had handled the megaphone
in the scene on the river, and who was, evidently, the director of the
company.

"That depends on what you want us to do," declared Tom.

"Oh, you won't have much to do. You see, it's like this," went on the
manager. "This man who did the shooting wants to escape. He runs up to
the railroad station here and buys his ticket-- we have that part of
it already. Then he is supposed to be in hiding behind yonder
freighthouse. When the train comes in, he waits for all other
passengers to get on board, then, as the train pulls out, he rushes
forward and catches on the last car. At the same time one of the other
fellows rushes out as if to catch him, but he is too late. Now, if you
want to get into the scene, you get on the train just before she
starts and stand on the back platform."

"Let's do it, Tom; it will be quite a lark!" exclaimed Sam.

"I'm willing," answered his brother; and so the matter was arranged.
Then the boys hurried into the ticket office, to get their tickets to
New York.

In the office they found old man Ricks, the station agent, grumbling
to himself.

"Wot ye want?" he demanded, sourly, as he looked at the Rovers.

"Two tickets to New York, Mr. Ricks," returned Tom. "What's the
matter?"

"Wot's the matter, huh? A whole lot, I should say!" declared old
Ricks, as he began to make out the tickets. "A lot o' them movin'
picter fellers been in here cuttin' up like mad."

"What did they do?" asked Sam, curiously.

"Huh! what didn't they do?" retorted the station master. "Come in
here, an' knocked over a box an' a basket, rushed up to the winder,
an' the next thing I knew, he had planked down a lot o' money, an'
when I stuck my head out the winder here, that feller pretended to
grab up a ticket wot I didn't give him at all, an' took up his money
and dusted out the door. At the same time while this was goin' on,
'nother feller had a light turned on this here winder wot nearly
blinded me, and the feller with that funny lookin' camera was
a-turnin' the crank to beat the cars!"

"They were only taking a moving picture, Mr. Ricks," declared Sam.
"You shouldn't object to that."

"Huh! I ain't hired by the railroad company to get in no movin'
picter," growled the station master. "I'm here to 'tend to the
railroad business, and nothin' else."

"Never mind, Mr. Ricks, if they've got you in the picture you ought to
be proud of it," declared Tom. "Think of the millions and millions of
people all over the world who will be looking at you when they visit
the moving picture theaters."

"Huh! I ain't no movin' picter actor, I ain't," snorted old Ricks.
"I'm a decent, respectable member o' this community, an' I'm a church
member, too. I ain't got no use for them movin' picter shows. It's a
waste o' good money, that's jest wot it is," and then Ricks shuffled
off to attend to some baggage that had come in.

With their tickets in their pockets, the two Rover boys rejoined the
moving picture company on the railroad platform. They were quite
interested in watching the camera man set up his machine, and asked
him several questions regarding its operation. Then they heard a
well-known whistle down the track, and knew that their train was
coming.

"All ready, there!" cried the manager of the moving picture company.
"Now, don't make a fizzle of it, Jake."

"I won't, unless the train pulls out too quickly," returned Jake. "I
am not going to get killed, though."

"Well, you've got to take some chances in this business," said the
manager, coolly.

There were six or eight passengers getting off the train, and about an
equal number to board the cars. As they had been instructed, the Rover
boys got on the rear platform of the last car, and stood in the
doorway looking back on the tracks. Tom pretended that he was waving
his hand to somebody in the distance.

As the train began to move, and while the camera man was taking the
picture, one of the actors, as agreed, rushed across the platform and
got hold of the rail of the last step. Then, as he pretended to have
hard work to pull himself up, the second actor came running down the
platform, shaking his fist at the man who was escaping. Then the train
passed out of sight around the bend, and the little moving picture
scene came to an end.

"Well, I'm glad that's over," declared he actor, as he followed the
boys into the car. "I never like the scenes where I am in danger of
getting hurt."

"You certainly must have a strenuous time of it," declared Sam; and
then he added quickly: "Are you going to New York with us?"

"Oh, no. I'm to get off at the first station and take another train
back to Oak Run. The crowd will wait for me. We have some scenes to do
at a farmhouse." And then, as he had a ride of ten minutes, the moving
picture man told the boys of some things which had happened to him
during his career as a movies' actor.

"How soon do you think they will show that picture?" asked Sam, when
the man prepared to leave the train.

"In a week or two," was the answer. "I don't know the exact date for
the release;" and then the man said good-bye and left them.

"Do you know, if I didn't have anything else to do, I wouldn't mind
going into the moving picture business," remarked Tom, as the train
rushed onward. "It must be lots of fun to be in the different scenes."

"Perhaps so, Tom. At the same time, those fellows must put up with a
great number of inconveniences. Think of plunging into the water when
it is cold, or into a burning building when the thermometer is over a
hundred in the shade."

"Oh, I know that, and, come to think of it, I was reading only
yesterday about a movies' actor who, in a war scene taken out on the
Hackensack meadows, fell into a trench, and broke an arm and also a
leg. Just the same, I wouldn't mind trying it."

"Maybe you'll get a chance some day."

On and on went the train, and, with little else to do, the boys
discussed the situations at home and in the city.

"One thing is sure, Tom," said the youngest Rover, earnestly. "No
matter what happens in New York, we mustn't let father know about it.
I think the worry is worse for him than anything else."

"Oh, I agree on that. Even if we lose a lot of money, he must not know
one word about it."

"Do you think we'll lose any money?"

"I don't know what to think. One thing is sure, something very much
out of the way has happened, or Dick wouldn't have sent that
telegram."

"Perhaps Pelter, Japson & Company haven't been as honest as they
promised to be. Maybe they are holding back some of the securities
that belong to dad."

"That may be so, too. At the same time, you must remember that
Songbird's uncle is our attorney, and I don't think Mr. Powell would
let them get away with very much. You'll remember what Dick wrote some
time ago, that he had taken the office fixtures for part of the debt.
That would seem to indicate that he had gotten everything from the
firm that he could lay his hands on."

"I wonder if we'll ever meet that Barton Pelter again."

"Perhaps, although if he is a nephew of Jesse Pelter, it is more than
likely he will keep out of sight, thinking that a meeting between us
would be very unpleasant."

At one of the stops a dining car was attached to the train, and, as
the boys were hungry, they lost no time in going in for the evening
meal.

"Say, Tom, look there," whispered Sam, during the course of the
repast, and, with a look from his eye, he indicated a man sitting on
the other side of the car. The fellow was a tall, surly individual,
plainly dressed. His face was somewhat flushed, as if he had been
drinking.

"Why, that's the head gardener at Hope!" said Tom. "It is queer that
he should be on this train, Sam!"

"If you'll remember, he lost his job at the seminary."

"He did? I didn't hear anything of that."

"Oh, yes, Grace told me about it. He was a splendid gardener, but
every once in a while he would drink too much, and then get into a
quarrel with the other help, so they had to let him go."

"It's a shame that such fellows can't leave drink alone," was Tom's
comment.

The man had settled himself, and ordered quite an elaborate dinner. He
was in the midst of eating, with the Rover boys paying little
attention to him, when he happened to glance at them. He straightened
up and stared in astonishment, and then looked decidedly
uncomfortable.

"He's looking at us, Tom," whispered Sam.

"Well, let him look if he wants to. It doesn't cost anything," was the
reply. And then Tom turned his head squarely, and stared at the former
seminary gardener. Immediately, the man dropped his eyes, and went on
with his meal. He soon finished, and, paying his bill, left the dining
car in a hurry.

"That's a queer way to do," was Sam's comment. "He acted as if he
didn't want us to see him."

"Maybe he is ashamed of himself for having lost his position,"
returned the brother. "Anyway, it's none of our business." And there
the talk came to an end.

  CHAPTER XVII

 WHAT DICK HAD TO TELL

"Here we are, Sam!"

"And I'm glad of it, Tom. I don't care much about riding in the cars
after it is too dark to look out of the windows," returned the
youngest Rover.

The train was nearing the Grand Central Terminal, in New York City.
The passengers were gathering their belongings, and the porter was
moving from one to another, brushing them and gathering in his tips.
Then the train rushed into the long station, and soon came to a halt.

"I wonder if Dick will be on hand to meet us?" said Sam, as he and his
brother left the car and made their way towards the waiting-room.

"Maybe, although it's pretty late."

There was a large crowd coming and going, and, for the moment, the
lads had all they could do to get through. Then, as they emerged into
the middle of the big waiting-room, they saw two familiar figures
close at hand.

"Hello, Dick! How do you do, Dora!"

"So here you are, Tom and Sam!" cried their big brother, and shook
hands heartily. Then Dora came up to greet the newcomers.

"Did you have a nice trip?" asked Dick's wife, as she smiled at them.

"Oh, yes, it was all right," answered Sam. "And what do you think? We
got in a moving picture!"

"You did!" exclaimed Dora. "That certainly is a new experience."

"We received your telegram, Dick," said Tom, and looked at his big
brother, anxiously. "I hope nothing very serious has happened."

"Well, Tom, I-- I----" Twice Dick tried to go on and failed. He looked
at both of his brothers, and his face showed something that they had
never seen in it before.

"Oh, Dick! Don't say anything here!" interposed Dora, hastily. "Wait
till we get to the hotel." She turned to Sam and Tom. "Don't ask him
any questions now. It won't do to have a scene here."

"All right, Dora, just as you say," answered Tom, quickly. Yet, both
he and Sam wondered greatly what had occurred to so upset Dick.

The oldest Rover boy had a taxicab handy, and into this the whole
party got and were quickly driven across Forty-second Street to Fifth
Avenue, and then, for a number of blocks, down that well-known
thoroughfare. Soon they turned towards Broadway, and a moment later
came to a stop before the main entrance of the Outlook Hotel.

"As you know, we have a suite of rooms here," said Dick to his
brothers. "I have hired an extra room next door, so we can all be
together."

A bellboy had already secured the newcomers' baggage, and, after
signing the register, Sam and Tom followed Dick and his wife to the
elevator and to the third floor.

"It's a fine layout, all right," declared Sam, when they were settled
and the bellboy had been dismissed.

Dick did not make any answer to this remark. He walked over to the
door, to see that it was closed, then he suddenly wheeled to confront
his brothers.

"You've got to know it sooner or later, so you might as well know it
now," he said in as steady a voice as he could command. "Do you
remember that I wrote to you about sixty-four thousand dollars' worth
of bonds that I had bought for dad in place of some securities that he
possessed?"

"Yes," answered both brothers.

"Well, those bonds have been stolen."

"Stolen!" gasped Sam.

"You don't mean it, Dick!" came from Tom.

"I do mean it. The bonds have been stolen, and, try my best, I can't
get a single clew as to where they went or who took them."

"Sixty-four thousand dollars! Phew!" ejaculated Sam. "That's some
loss!"

"But please don't blame Dick," broke in Dora. "I am sure it isn't his
fault."

"How did it happen?" questioned Tom.

"They were taken out of the safe at the offices."

"Stolen from the safe, you mean?"

"Yes."

"When was this?"

"Day before yesterday."

"Of course the safe was locked?" put in Sam.

"Certainly."

"But Pelter and Japson knew that combination, didn't they, Dick?"
questioned Tom, eagerly.

"No, Tom, they did not. When they turned the offices over to me,
Pelter made some sarcastic remark, stating I had better have the
combination changed. I told him I certainly would have it changed; and
the very next day I had the safe makers up to inspect the lock, and
change the combination."

"Humph! Then that lets Pelter and Japson out, doesn't it?"

"But somebody must have taken those bonds," came from Sam. "Did
anybody else have the combination, Dick?"

"Nobody but Dora. I gave her the figures, so she could get the safe
open in case anything happened to me, or I was away."

"I've got the figures on a card in my pocket-book," explained Dora,
"but I don't believe anybody saw them. In fact, the card has nothing
but the bare figures on it, so it isn't likely that any one would
understand what those figures meant. Oh, but isn't it perfectly
dreadful! I-- I hope you-- you boys won't blame Dick," she faltered.

"Of course we don't blame Dick," returned Tom, promptly.

"Why should we blame him?" added Sam. "If he put the bonds in the safe
and locked them up, I can't see how this robbery is his fault. It
might have happened to any of us."

"I'm glad to hear you say that," returned Dick; and his face showed
his relief. "Just the same, boys, we have got to find those bonds. Our
family can't afford to lose sixty-four thousand dollars-- or rather
sixty thousand dollars."

"What do you mean, Dick?" asked Tom. "You said sixty-four thousand
dollars."

"So I did, but four thousand of the bonds were registered in dad's
name, principal and interest, so it's likely the thief won't be able
to use them."

"And all the other bonds were unregistered?" queried Sam.

"Yes, every one of them."

"So they can be used by any one?"

"Exactly-- although, of course, the thief would have to be very
careful how he disposed of them."

"Have you notified the police?" asked Tom.

"Not yet. I wanted to consult you first. Besides, I thought it might
be possible that the thief would put an advertisement in the
newspapers, offering to return the bonds for a reward. But so far, I
haven't seen any such advertisement."

"It isn't likely they'll offer to return them if sixty thousand
dollars' worth are negotiable," returned Tom. "But give us the
particulars of the affair;" and the youth dropped into a seat, and the
others did the same.

"Well, to start with, as I said before, as soon as Pelter and Japson
and their hired help left, I had the lock of the safe investigated,
and then had the combination changed," began Dick. "The fellow from
the safe company showed me how the combination was worked, so I fixed
the new numbers to suit myself, in order that no outsider would know
how to open the safe. I put the numbers down on two cards, and placed
one of the cards in my notebook, and gave the other to Dora. As she
said, the cards had nothing on them but the bare numbers, so that a
person getting one of the cards would not know that the numbers
referred to the safe combination.

"It took me several days to get rid of the old stocks, and while I was
doing that I, from time to time, purchased the bonds, buying them, on
the advice of Mr. Powell, from several bond houses in Wall Street. I
also bought a brand new japanned box with a little lock, and placed
the bonds in that box, and then put the box in the safe. The last I
saw of the bonds was about half-past four in the afternoon, when I
placed the last of the bonds in the box. I came down to the office at
a little before ten o'clock the next morning, and opened the safe
about half an hour later. Then the box was gone."

"Wait a minute, Dick," interrupted Tom. "You just said you opened the
safe. Wasn't the door already open?"

"No, the door was shut and locked, just as I had left it the night
before."

"Humph! Then somebody must have worked the combination," ventured Sam.

"So it would seem, Sam, and yet when I had the lock inspected, the
safe company man told me that that was a first-class combination, and
practically burglar proof."

"Is it an old safe?"

"I don't think so-- in fact, the safe man led me to believe it was one
of the newer kinds. It is about five feet square, and the walls are
almost a foot thick. Oh, it is some safe, I can tell you that!"

"But it was not safe in this instance," retorted Tom, who, no matter
how serious the situation, was bound to have his little joke.

"You said Pelter and Japson had gone for good," continued Sam. "Is
there nobody else around attached to the old firm?"

"I took on their old office boy, a lad named Bob Marsh. You'll
remember him," returned the oldest Rover. "He said he wanted work the
worst way, so I thought I would give him a chance."

"Maybe he got the combination, and gave it to Pelter or Japson."

"I don't think so, Sam. The boy is rather forward in his manner, but I
think he is perfectly honest."

"Yes, but somebody opened that safe and took the box of bonds," put in
Tom.

"I know that, Tom, and we've got to get those bonds back, or it will
be a very serious piece of business for us," answered the oldest Rover
boy, soberly.

"Was anything else taken, Dick?" questioned Sam.

"Not a thing. And that's queer, too, because I had a number of private
papers in the safe, and also our new set of books."

"Then that would go to show that all the thief was after were the
bonds," came from Tom. "You say they were in a new japanned box that
was locked?"

"Yes, but the lock didn't amount to much. I think it could easily be
opened."

"Sixty thousand dollars is a lot of money to lose," mused Sam. "Dick,
that will put us in something of a hole, won't it?"

"It may. But don't let us think about that, Sam. Let us try to get the
bonds back," returned his oldest brother, earnestly.

  CHAPTER XVIII

 AT THE OFFICES

After that the three Rovers and Dick's wife talked the matter over for
fully an hour. Dick gave Sam and Tom all the particulars he could
think of, and answered innumerable questions. But try their best, not
one of the party could venture a solution of the mystery.

"I think you had better go to bed," said Dora, at last. "You can go
down to the offices the first thing in the morning, and make up your
minds what to do next;" and this advice was followed.

"No use of talking, this is a fierce loss!" was Tom's comment, when he
and Sam were retiring.

"Yes, and Dick feels pretty bad over it," returned the youngest Rover.
"I am afraid he imagines that we think he is to blame."

"Maybe, but I don't blame him, Sam. That might have happened to you or
me just as well as to him."

It must be admitted that the boys did not sleep very soundly that
night. For a long time each lay awake, speculating over the mystery,
and wondering what had become of the bonds.

"Perhaps Pelter and Japson had nothing at all to do with it," thought
Tom, as he reviewed the situation. "It may have been some outsider,
who watched Dick alter the combination of the safe."

All of the boys were up early in the morning, and accompanied by Dora,
obtained breakfast in the hotel dining-room.

"If you want me to go along, I shall be glad to do so," said Dora,
during the course of the meal. It cut her to the heart to have Dick so
troubled.

"No, Dora, you had better stay here, or else spend your time
shopping," answered Dick. "We'll have to take care of this matter
ourselves."

"I'll tell you what you can do," broke in Tom. "You can write a nice
letter to Aunt Martha, telling her that we have arrived safely, and
that we are going into some business matters with Dick. Of course, you
needn't say a word about the robbery. It will be time enough to tell
her and Uncle Randolph after we have tried all we can to get the bonds
back-- and failed."

As my old readers will probably remember, the offices formerly
occupied by Pelter, Japson & Company were located at the lower end of
Wall Street. The building was an old one, five stories in height,
which had recently been put in repair. The offices were on the fourth
floor in the extreme rear, and had a fairly good outlook.

The Rovers found the office boy, Bob Marsh, already on hand, and doing
some work which Dick had given him. He was a bright, sharp-eyed lad,
his only failing being that he was a bit forward.

"Any one here to see me, Bob?" asked Dick, as they entered.

"Nobody, sir, but an agent that wanted to sell you some kind of a new
calendar. I told him we had bushels of calendars already," and the boy
grinned slightly.

Passing through two small offices, the Rovers came to one in the
rear-- that which had formerly been used by Jesse Pelter.

"Looks a little bit familiar," observed Tom. "Looks like when I
visited it as Roy A. Putnam, from Denver, Colorado, and thought about
taking stock in the Irrigation Company," and he laughed shortly as he
recalled that incident, the particulars of which have been related in
"The Rover Boys in New York."

"You've got pretty big offices for only you and the office boy,"
remarked Sam.

"I took them just as the old concern had them," returned Dick. "But if
business increases, I guess we'll have to have quite some office help.
Anyway, a bookkeeper and a stenographer."

"Hadn't you better send that office boy out for a little while?"
suggested Sam.

"A good idea," returned his oldest brother, and sent the lad on an
errand up to the post-office.

Left to themselves, the Rovers once more went over the details of the
robbery so far as they knew them. Dick opened the safe, showing his
brothers how the combination lock was worked; then the boys looked
inside the strong-box, and into the private compartment which, so Dick
told them, had contained the missing box of bonds.

"I don't see how they got into this safe," was Sam's comment, after
the door had been closed and the combination turned on. "I can't make
head or tail of how to get it open."

"Let me have a try at it," returned Tom, and he worked for several
minutes over the combination.

"Here are the figures for the combination," said Dick, and he turned
them over to his brothers. But even with the figures before them, they
found it no easy task to open the heavy door of the strong-box. This
door was provided with several bolts, so that to get it open without
either working the combination or else blowing the door open, was out
of the question.

"It's a Chinese puzzle to me. I give it up," declared Tom, at last.
"The only way I imagine, Dick, is that, somehow or other, somebody got
hold of that combination."

"It would seem so, Tom. But I can't see how it could be done, or who
did it," was the answer.

It was fortunate that, at that instant, Charley's face was turned
away, or the Seigneur would have seen it go white and startled.

Charley did not dare turn his head for the moment. He could not
speak. What did the Seigneur know of Beauty Steele?

To hide his momentary confusion, he went over to the drawer of a cupboard
in the wall, and placed the book inside. It gave him time to recover
himself. When he turned round again his face was calm, his manner
composed.

"And who, may I ask, is Beauty Steele?" he said.

"Faith I do not know," answered the Seigneur, taking a pinch of snuff.
"It's years since I first read the phrase in a letter a scamp of
a relative of mine wrote me from the West.

He had met a man of the name, who had a reputation as a clever
fop, a very handsome fellow.

So I thought it a good phrase, and I've used it ever since on occasions.
'More airs than Beauty Steele.'--It has a sound; it's effective, I
fancy, Monsieur?"

"Decidedly effective," answered Charley quietly. He picked up his
shears.
"You will excuse me," he said grimly, "but I must earn my living.

I cannot live on my reputation."

The Seigneur and the Cure lifted their hats--to the tailor.

"Au revoir, Monsieur," they both said, and Charley bowed them out.

The two friends turned to each other a little way up the street.
"Something will come of this, Cure," said the Seigneur. The Cure, whose
face had a look of happiness, pressed his arm in reply.

Inside the tailor-shop, a voice kept saying, "More airs than Beauty
Steele!"

CHAPTER XXXIX
THE SCARLET WOMAN
Since the evening in the garden when she had been drawn into Charley's
arms, and then fled from them in joyful confusion, Rosalie had been
in a dream.

She had not closed her eyes all night, or, if she closed them, they
still saw beautiful things flashing by, to be succeeded by other
beautiful things.

It was a roseate world. To her simple nature it was not so important to
be loved as to love. Selfishness was as yet the minor part of her. She
had been giving all her life--to her mother, as a child; to sisters
at the convent who had been kind to her; to the poor and the sick
of the parish; to her father, who was helpless without her; to the
tailor across the way.

In each case she had given more than she had got.

A nature overflowing with impulsive affection, it must spend itself
upon others.

The maternal instinct was at the very core of her nature, and care
for others was as much a habit as an instinct with her.

She had love to give, and it must be given.

It had been poured like the rain from heaven on the just and the unjust;
on animals as on human beings, and in so far as her nature, in the
first spring--the very April--of its powers, could do.

Till Charley had come to Chaudiere, it had all been the undisciplined
ardour of a girl's nature. A change had begun in the moment when she
had tearfully thrust the oil and flour in upon his excoriated breast.
Later came real awakening, and a riotous outpouring of herself in
sympathy, in observation, in a reckless kindness which must have
done her harm but that her clear intelligence balanced her actions,
and because secrecy in one thing helped to restrain her in all.

Yet with all the fresh overflow of her spirit, which, assisted by
her new position as postmistress, made her a conspicuous and popular
figure in the parish, where officialdom had rare honour and little
labour, she had prejudices almost unworthy of her, due though they
were to radical antipathy.

These prejudices, one against Jo Portugais and the other against
Paulette Dubois, she had never been able entirely to overcome, though
she had honestly tried. On the way to the hospital at Quebec,
however, Jo had been so careful of her father, so respectful when
speaking of M'sieu', so regardful of her own comfort, that her
antagonism to him was lulled.

But the strong prejudice against Paulette Dubois remained, casting
a shadow on her bright spirit.

All this day she had moved about in a mellow dream, very busy,
scarcely thinking.

New feelings dominated her, and she was too primitive to analyse them
and too occupied with them to realise acutely the life about her.

Work was an abstraction, resting rather than tiring her.

Many times she had looked across at the tailor-shop, only seeing Charley
once. She did not wish to speak with him now, nor to be near him
yet; she wanted this day for herself only.

So it was that, soon after the Cure and the Seigneur had bade good-bye
to Charley, she left the post-office and went quickly through the
village to a spot by the river, where was a place called the Rest
of the Flaxbeaters.

It was an overhanging rock which made a kind of canopy over a sweet
spring, where, in the days when their labours sounded through the
valley, the flaxbeaters from the level below came to eat their meals
and to rest.

This had always been a resort for her in the months when the
flax-beaters did not use it. Since a child she had made the place
her own.

To this day it is called Rosalie's Dell; for are not her sorrows
and joys still told by those who knew and loved her?

  and is not the parish still fragrant with her name?

 Has not her history become a living legend a thousand times told?

Leaving the village behind her, Rosalie passed down the high-road
till she came to a path that led off through a grove of scattered
pines.

There would be yet a half-hour's sun and then a short twilight, and
the river and the woods and the Rest of the Flax-beaters would be
her own; and she could think of the wonderful thing come upon her.

She had brought with her a book of English poems, and as she went
through the grove she opened it, and in her pretty English repeated
over and over to herself:
"My heart is thine, and soul and body render Faith to thy faith; I
give nor hold in thrall:
Take all, dear love!

thou art my life's defender; Speak to my soul!

Take life and love; take all!"
She was lifted up by the abandonment of the verse, by the fulness
of her own feelings, which had only needed a touch of beauty to
give it exaltation.

The touch had come.

She went on abstractedly to the place where she had trysted with
her thoughts only, these many years, and, sitting down, watched the
sun sink beyond the trees, the shades of evening fall.

All that had happened since Charley came to the parish she went over
in her mind.

She remembered the day he had said this, the day he had said that;
she brought back the night--it was etched upon her mind!

--when he had said to her, "You have saved my life, Mademoiselle!" She
recalled the time she put the little cross back on the church-door,
the ghostly footsteps in the church, the light, the lost hood.

A shudder ran through her now, for the mystery of that hood had never
been cleared up.

But the words on the page caught her eye again:

"My heart is thine, and soul and body render Faith to thy faith .
. ."

It swallowed up the moment's agitation. Never till this day, never till
last night, had she dared to say to herself, He loves me.

He seemed so far above her--she never had thought of him as a
tailor!

--that she had given and never dared hope to receive, had lived without
anticipation lest there should come despair.

Even that day at Vadrome Mountain she had not thought he meant love,
when he had said to her that he would remember to the last.

When he had said that he would die for love's sake, he had not meant
her, but others--some one else whom he would save by his death.
Kathleen, that name which had haunted her--ah, whoever Kathleen
was, or whatever Kathleen had to do with him or his life, she had
no reason to fear Kathleen now.

She had no reason to fear any one; for had she not heard his words of
love as he clasped her in his arms last night?

Had she not fled from that enfolding, because her heart was so full in
the hour of her triumph that she could not bear more, could not
look longer into the eyes to which she had told her love before his
was spoken?

In the midst of her thoughts she heard footsteps.

She started up.
Paulette Dubois suddenly appeared in the path below. She had taken
the river-path down from Vadrome Mountain, where she had gone
to see Jo Portugais, who had not yet returned from Quebec. Paulette's
face was agitated, her manner nervous. For nights she had not slept,
and her approaching meeting with the tailor had made her tremble
all day.

Excited as she was, there was a wild sort of beauty in her face,
and her figure was lithe and supple.

She dressed always a little garishly, but now there was only that
band of colour round the throat, worn last night in the talk with
Charley.

To both women this meeting was as a personal misfortune, a mutual
affront.

Each had a natural antipathy. To Rosalie the invasion of her beloved
retreat was as hateful as though the woman had purposely intruded.

For a moment they confronted each other without speaking, then Rosalie's
natural courtesy, her instinctive good-heartedness, overcame her
irritation, and she said quietly:

"Good-evening, Madame."

"I am not Madame, and you know it," answered the woman harshly.

"I am sorry. Good-evening, Mademoiselle," rejoined Rosalie evenly.

"You wanted to insult me.

You knew I wasn't Madame."

Rosalie shook her head. "How should I know? You have not always lived
in Chaudiere, you have lived in Montreal, and people often call you
Madame."

"You know better. You know that letters come to me from Montreal
addressed Mademoiselle."

Rosalie turned as if to go. "I do not recall what letters pass
through the post-office.

I have a good memory for forgetting. Good-evening," she added, with an
excess of courtesy.

Paulette read the placid scorn in the girl's face; she did not see
and would not understand that Rosalie did not scorn her for what
she had ever done, but for something that she was.

"You think I am the dirt under your feet," she said, now white, now
red, and mad with anger.

"I'm not fit to speak with you--I'm a rag for the dust pile!"
"I have never thought so," answered Rosalie. "I have not liked you,
but I am sorry for you, and I never thought those things."
"You lie!"

was the rejoinder; and Rosalie, turning away quickly with trouble in
her face, put her hands to her ears, and, hastening down the
hillside, did not hear the words the woman called after her.

"To-morrow every one shall know you are a thief. Run, run, run! You can
hear what I say, white-face! They shall know about the little cross
to-morrow."
She followed Rosalie at a distance, her eyes blazing.

As fate would have it, she met on the highroad the least scrupulous
man in the parish, an inveterate gossip, the keeper of the general
store, whose only opposition in business was the post-office shop.
He was the centre of the village tittle-tattle, and worse.

With malicious speed Paulette told him how she had seen Rosalie
Evanturel nailing the little cross on the church door of a certain
night.

If he wanted proof of what she said, let him ask Jo Portugais.

Having spat out her revenge, she went on to the village, and through
it to her house, where she prepared to visit the shop of the tailor.
Her sense of retaliation satisfied, Rosalie passed from her mind;
her child only occupied it.

In another hour she would know where her child was--the tailor had
promised that she should. Then perhaps she would be sorry for the
accident to the Notary; for it was an accident, in spite of
appearances.

It was dark when Paulette entered the door of the tailor's house. When
she came out, a half-hour later, with elation in her carriage, and
tears of joy running down her face, she did not look about her;
she did not care whether or not any one saw her: she was possessed
with only one thought--her child!

She passed like a swift wind down the street, making for home and for
her departure to the hiding-place of her child.

She had not seen a figure in the shadow of a tree near by as she came
from the tailor's door. She had not heard a smothered cry behind
her. She was not aware that in unspeakable agony another woman knocked
softly at the door of the tailor's house, and, not waiting for an
answer, opened it and entered. It was Rosalie Evanturel.

CHAPTER XL
AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING

The kitchen was empty, but light fell through the door of the shop
opening upon the little hall between. Rosalie crossed the hall and
stood in the doorway of the shop, a figure of concentrated
indignation, despair, and shame.

Leaning on his elbow Charley was bending over a book in the light of
a candle on the bench be side him. He was reading aloud, translating
into English the German text of the narrative the Cure had given
him:
"And because of this divine interposition, consequent upon their
faithful prayers and their oblations, they did perform these holy
scenes from season to season, with solemn proof of piety and godly
living, so that it seemed the life of the Lord our Shepherd was
ever present with them, as though, indeed, Ober-Ammergau were
Nazareth or Jerusalem.

And the hearts of all in the land did answer daily to that sweet
and lively faith, insomuch that even in times of war the zeal of
the people became an holy zeal, and their warfare noble; so that
they did accept both victory and defeat with equal humbleness.

Because there was no war in their hearts, but peace, and they did
fight to defend and not to acquire, they buried their foe with tears
and their own with singleness of heart and quiet joy, for that
they did rest from their labours. In this manner was the great tragedy
and glory of the world made to the people a present thing, transforming
them to the body of the Life that hath neither spot nor blemish
nor . . ."

Charley had not heard Rosalie enter, nor her footsteps in the hall.

But now there ran through his reading a thread of something not of
himself or of it. He had thrilled to the archaic but clear-hearted style
of the old German chronicler, and the warmth he felt had passed
into his voice, so that it became louder.

As Rosalie listened to his reading, a hundred thoughts rushed through
her mind.

Paulette Dubois, the wanton woman, had just left his doorway secretly,
yet there he was, instantly after, calmly reading a pious book!
Her mind was in tumult.

She could not reason, she could not rule her judgment. She only knew
that the woman had come from this house, and hurried guiltily away
into the dark.

She only knew that the man the woman had left here was the man she
loved--loved more than her life, for he embodied all her past; all
her present--she knew that she could not live without him; all her
future--for where he went she would go, whatever the fate.

Her judgment had been swept from its moorings. She had been carried on
the wave of her heart's fever into this room, not daring to think
this or that, not planning this or that, not accusing, not
reproaching, not shaming herself and him by black suspicion, but
blindly, madly demanding to see him, to look into his eyes, to hear
his voice, to know him, whatever he was--man, lover, or devil.

She was a child-woman--a child in her primitive feelings that threw
aside all convention, because there was no wrong in her heart; a woman,
because she was possessed by a jealousy which shamed and angered her,
because its very existence put him on trial, condemned him.

Her soul was the sport of emotions and passions stronger than herself,
because the heritage, the instinct, of all the race of women, the
eternal predisposition. At the moment her will was not sufficient
to rule them to obedience. She was in the first subservience to that
power which feeds the streams of human history.

As she now listened to Charley reading, a sudden revulsion of feeling
came over her.

Some note in his voice reassured her heart--if it needed reassuring.
The quiet force of his presence stilled the tumult in her, so that
her eyes could see without mist, her heart beat without agony; but every
pulse in her was throbbing, every instinct was alive. Presently there
rushed upon her the words that had rung in her ears and chimed in her
heart at the Rest of the Flax-beaters:

"Take all, dear love! thou art my life's defender; Speak to my soul!
Take life and love; take all."
Feelings lying beneath the mad conflict of emotion which had sent
her into this room in such unmaidenly fashion--feelings that were
her deepest self-welled up.

Her breath came hard and broken.

As Charley read on, a breathing seemed to answer his own. It became
quicker than his own, it pierced the stillness, it filled the room
with feeling, it came calling to him out of the silence.

He swung round, and saw the girl in the doorway.

"Rosalie!" he cried, and sprang to his feet.

With a piteously pathetic cry, she flung herself on her knees beside the
tailor's bench where he worked every day, and, burying her face in
her arms as they rested on the bench, wept bitterly.

"Rosalie!"

  he said anxiously, leaning over her.

 "What is the matter?

What has happened?"

She wept more bitterly still; she made a despairing gesture.

His hand touched her hair; he dropped on a knee beside her.

"Oh, I am so ashamed, ashamed! I have been so wicked," she murmured.

"Rosalie, what has happened?"

he urged gently. His own heart was beating hard, his own eyes were
responding to hers.

The new feelings alive in him, the forces his love had
awakened, which, last night, had kept him sleepless, and had been
upon him like a dream all day--they were at height in him now.

He knew not how to command them.

"Rosalie, dearest, tell me all!" he persisted.

"I shall never--I have been--oh--you will never forgive me!" she said
brokenly. "I knew it wasn't true, but I couldn't help it.

I saw her--the woman--come from your house, and--"
"Hush! For God's sake, hush!" he broke in almost harshly. Then a
better understanding came upon him, and it made him gentle with
her.

"Ah, Rosalie, you did not think! But--but it was natural you should wish
to see me. . . ."

"But, as soon as I saw you, I knew that--that--" She broke down
again and wept.

"I will tell you about her, Rosalie--" His fingers stroked her hair,
and, bending over her, his face was near her hands.

"No, no, tell me nothing--oh, if you tell me!--"
"She came to hear from me what she ought to have heard from the
Notary.

She has had great trouble--the man--her child--and I have helped her,
told her--" His face was so near now that his breath was on her
hair.

She suddenly raised her head and clasped his face in her hands.

"I knew--oh, I knew, I knew . . . !" she wept, and her eyes drank
his.

"Rosalie, my life!" he cried, clasping her in his arms.

The love that was in him, new-born and but half understood, poured
itself out in broken words like her own.

For him there was no outside world; no past, no Kathleen, no Billy;
no suspicion, or infidelity, or unfaith; no fear of disaster; no
terrors of the future.

Life was Now to him and to her: nothing brooded behind, nothing lay
before. The candle spluttered and burnt low in the socket.

CHAPTER XLI
IT WAS MICHAELMAS DAY
Not a cloud in the sky, and, ruling all, a sweet sun, liberal in
warmth and eager in brightness as its distance from the northern
world decreased.

As Mrs. Flynn entered the door of the post-office she sang out to
Maximilian Cour, with a buoyant lilt: "Oh, isn't it the fun o' the
world to be alive!"

The tailor over the way heard it, and lifted his head with a smile;
Rosalie Evanturel, behind the postal wicket, heard it, and her face
swam with colour.

Rosalie busied herself with the letters and papers for a moment
before she answered Mrs.

Flynn's greeting, for there were ringing in her ears the words she
herself had said a few days before: "It is good to live, isn't it?"

To-day it was so good to live that life seemed an endless being
and a tireless happy doing--a gift of labour, an inspiring daytime,
and a rejoicing sleep.

Exaltation, a painful joy, and a wide embarrassing wonderment possessed
her. She met Mrs.

Flynn's face at the wicket with shining eyes and a timid smile.

"Ah, there y'are, darlin'!" said Mrs. Flynn. "And how's the dear
father to-day?"

"He seems about the same, thank you."
"Ah, that's foine.

Shure, if we could always be 'about the same,' we'd do. True for you,
darlin', 'tis as you say.

If ould Mary Flynn could be always ''bout the same,' the clods o' the
valley would never cover her bones. But there 'tis--we're here to-day,
and away tomorrow. Shure, though, I am not complainin'. Not I--not
Mary Flynn.

Teddy Flynn used to say to me, says he: 'Niver born to know distress!

Happy as worms in a garden av cucumbers. Seventeen years in this country,
Mary,' says he, 'an' nivir in the pinitintiary yet.' There y'are.
Ah, the birds do be singin' to-day! 'Tis good! 'Tis good, darlin'!
You'll not mind Mary Flynn callin' you darlin', though y'are
postmistress, an' 'll be more than that--more than that wan day--or
Mary Flynn's a fool.

Aye, more than that y'll be, darlin', and y're eyes like purty brown
topazzes and y're cheeks like roses-shure, is there anny lether
for Mary Flynn, darlin'?"

she hastily added as she saw the Seigneur standing in the doorway.
He had evidently been listening.

"Ye didn't hear what y're ould fool of a cook was sayin'," she added
to the Seigneur, as Rosalie shook her head and answered: "No letters,
Madame--dear."

Rosalie timidly added the dear, for there was something so great-hearted
in Mrs.

Flynn that she longed to clasp her round the neck, longed as she had
never done in her life to lay her head upon some motherly breast and
pour out her heart. But it was not to be now.

Secrecy was her duty still.

"Can't ye speak to y're ould fool of a cook, sir?" Mrs. Flynn said
again, as the Seigneur made way for her to leave the shop.

"How did you guess?"

he said to her in a low voice, his sharp eyes peering into
hers.

"By the looks in y're face these past weeks, and the look in
hers," she whispered, and went on her way rejoicing.

"I'll wind thim both round me finger like a wisp o' straw," she
said, going up the road with a light step, despite her weight, till
she was stopped by the malicious grocer-man of the village, whose
tongue had been wagging for hours upon an unwholesome theme.

Meanwhile, in the post-office, the Seigneur and Rosalie were face
to face.

"It is Michaelmas day," he said. "May I speak with you, Mademoiselle?"

She looked at the clock. It was on the stroke of noon. The shop always
closed from twelve till half-past twelve.

"Will you step into the parlour, Monsieur?" she said, and coming
round the counter, locked the shop-door.

She was trembling and confused, and entered the little parlour shyly.

Yet her eyes met the Seigneur's bravely.

"Your father, how is he?" he said, offering her a chair. The sunlight
streaming in the window made a sort of pathway of light between
them, while they were in the shade.

"He seems no worse, and to-day he is wheeling himself about."
"He is stronger, then--that's good. Is there any fear that he must
go to the hospital again?"
She inclined her head.

"The doctor says he may have to go any moment. It may be his one chance.
The Cure is very kind, and says that, with your permission, his
sister will keep the office here, if--if needed."

The Seigneur nodded briskly. "Of course, of course.

But have you not thought that we might secure another postmistress?"

Her face clouded a little; her heart beat hard.

She knew what was coming.

She dreaded it, but it was better to have it over now.

"We could not live without it," she said helplessly.

"What we have saved is not enough. The little my mother had must pay
for the visits to the hospital.

I have kept it for that.

You see, I need the place here."
During that time the boys also received visits from several private
detectives, all anxious to take hold of the case, but none of them
willing to do so without first receiving a generous retainer.

"I am not going to pay out anything in advance," Dick told one of
these fellows-- a shabby looking chap. "You locate the bonds, and
you'll be well paid for it."

"I don't work unless I'm paid for it," snapped the detective, and left
the offices quite indignant.

"I suppose we could get a thousand detectives on this case if we were
willing to put up the money," said Tom.

"It might pay to hire some first-class man," ventured Sam, "but not
that sort."

"I'll call up Mr. Powell and see what he thinks of it," answered Dick.
And a little later he was in communication with Songbird's uncle over
the telephone.

"It wouldn't do any harm to put some first-class man on the case,"
said the lawyer. "If you wish me to do so, I'll put you in touch with
the best detective agency in the city."

As a result of this talk, the Rovers obtained the address of a
detective whose name is well-known in every large city of the United
States. This man called on them the following day, and went over the
case very carefully with the youths. He examined the safe and the
combination lock, and then had a long talk with Kitty Donovan and her
father and her mother, and also a talk with the old man who kept the
little fruit stand downstairs.

"I'll do all I can, Mr. Rover," he said, when he re-entered the
offices, "but you mustn't expect too much. This is certainly a
mystery."

"Mr. Bronson is the most intelligent detective I've seen yet," said
Sam, after the man had departed. "He handles the case as if it was a
strict business proposition."

"That's what I like to see," declared Tom. "The other kind of
detective is good enough for a dime or a half-dime story book, but he
never makes any success of it in real life."

It must not be supposed that now they were in New York, Tom and Sam
had forgotten the Laning girls. They had written to Nellie and Grace,
forwarding the letters to Cedarville because Hope Seminary was on the
point of closing for the season.

"Letters for both of you!" cried Dora, when they and Dick appeared at
the hotel one evening after a rather strenuous day in the offices,
where all had been busy forming their plans for further investments.

"Good for you, Dora!" answered Tom, and held out his hand eagerly.

"Now wouldn't you like to have it?" she answered mischievously,
holding a letter just out of his reach.

"Where is mine?" demanded Sam.

"Oh, I thought you wouldn't want that so I tore it up," she answered,
with a twinkle in her eyes.

"If you don't give me that letter, Dora, something is going to happen
to you," went on Tom; and now he caught her by the wrist. "You know
the forfeit-- a kiss!"

"All right, take your letter, Mr. Can't-Wait," she returned, and
handed him the missive.

"But you said you had one for me!" broke in Sam. "Come now, Dora,
don't be mean."

"Oh, Sam, it's only a bill."

"A bill! You are fooling!" And then as his face fell, she did not have
the heart to tease him longer, and brought the letter forth from her
handbag.

As the lads had anticipated, the communications were from Grace and
Nellie. In them the girls said that the session at the seminary was
over, and that the day previous they had returned to their home on the
outskirts of Cedarville. Both had passed in their examinations, for
which they were exceedingly thankful.

"But they haven't found that four-hundred-dollar diamond ring yet,"
said Sam, after he had finished his letter. "It certainly is a shame!"

"It's as great a mystery as the disappearance of our bonds," was
Dick's comment.

"What has Nellie to say about it, Tom?" questioned Dora, anxiously;
for even though she was married and away from them, her two cousins
were as dear to her as ever.

"She doesn't say very much," answered Tom. "No one has seen or heard
anything about the ring."

"But what of Miss Harrow? How has she treated Nellie since the fire?"

"She says Miss Harrow has not been very well, and consequently did not
take part in the final examinations. Now the teacher has gone to
Asbury Park, on the New Jersey coast, to spend the summer."

"Perhaps that mystery never will be solved," said Sam. "It's a jolly
shame, that's all I've got to say about it!"

After dinner that evening, as it was exceedingly warm, none of the
young folks felt like staying in the hotel. Dick proposed that they
take a stroll up Broadway.

"We can walk till we get tired," he said, "and then if you feel like
it, we can jump into a taxi and take a ride around Central Park before
we retire."

"That will be nice," returned Dora; and Tom and Sam said it would suit
them, too.

As usual, upper Broadway-- commonly called The Great White Way-- was
ablaze with electric lights. As the young folks strolled along, the
great, flaring advertising signs perched on the tops of many of the
buildings interested them greatly.

"I heard yesterday that some of those signs cost ten thousand dollars
and more," observed Sam. "What a lot of money to put into them!"

"So it is, Sam. But think of all the money some firms spend in
newspaper and magazine advertising," answered Dick.

"Some day we'll have to do some advertising ourselves," put in Tom.
"That is, after we get our business in first-class running order."

"And get our bonds back," added Dick.

"Oh, say, let's forget those bonds for just one night!" entreated Sam.
"I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep since I came here
because of them."

The portion of Broadway where they were walking, is lined with
innumerable theaters and moving picture places. They had passed on
less than three blocks further, when Sam suddenly caught Tom by the
arm.

"Here we are, Tom!" he exclaimed, somewhat excitedly. "Here's that
moving picture."

"So it is!" returned Tom, and immediately became as interested as his
younger brother. They had come to a halt before a gorgeous moving
picture establishment, and on one of the billboards they saw exhibited
a flashy lithograph, depicting two men struggling in a rowboat with a
third man on the shore aiming a gun at one of the others. Over the
picture were the words: "His Last Chance. A Thrilling Rural Drama in
Two Reels."

"What is it, Tom?" questioned Dora.

"Why, that's the moving picture play we told you about-- the one that
we got into at the Oak Run railroad station," explained the youth.
"That picture you see there was taken along the river bank back of our
farm. Another picture shows the railroad station at Oak Run, with old
Ricks in it, and still another ought to show the railroad train with
Sam and me on the back platform. Let us go in and see it."

"Why, yes, I want to see that by all means!" declared Dick's wife.
"Won't it be funny to see you boys in a moving picture!"

"Well, I don't know about this," returned Dick, hesitatingly; and he
looked rather quickly at Tom. "Are you quite sure, Tom, that you want
to go into a moving picture show?" he went on. He had not forgotten
how Tom had once gone to a moving picture exhibition, and been
completely carried away by a scene of gold digging in faraway Alaska,
nor how his poor brother had for a time lost his mind and wandered off
to the faraway territory, as related in detail in "The Rover Boys in
Alaska."

"Oh, don't you fear for me, Dick!" cried Tom, hastily. "My head is
just as good as it ever was and able to stand a hundred moving picture
shows. Come on in, I'll get the tickets;" and without waiting for an
answer, Tom stepped up to the little ticket booth and secured the
necessary pasteboards.

  CHAPTER XXII

 THE MOVING PICTURE AGAIN

The moving picture theater was fairly well filled, but the four
managed to obtain seats close to the middle of the auditorium. They
had entered while a slap-dash comedy was being depicted-- something
that set the audience laughing heartily. Then followed a parlor drama,
which was more notable for its exhibition of fashions than it was for
plot or acting.

"This sort of thing makes me tired!" was Tom's comment. "I like to see
outdoor life much better."

Another one-reel comedy of life on the canal followed the parlor
drama, and then there was flashed on the screen the words: "His Last
Chance."

"Here we are!" murmured Sam, and sat bolt upright with renewed
interest, while Tom did likewise. The first scene of the drama showed
the interior of a farmhouse sitting-room and kitchen, and the boys
easily recognized several of the men they had seen at the river and
the railroad station. There followed quite a plot and a number of
other scenes around the farm, and also at a stone quarry which all of
the lads recognized as being located at Dexter's Corners. Then came a
pretty love scene at the farmhouse, followed by a quarrel between some
of the men in an apple orchard.

"Say, that's Blinks' apple orchard, just as sure as fate!" exclaimed
Dick, in a low voice.

"So it is!" answered Sam. "Many's the time we've got apples there!"

The quarrel in the apple orchard was followed by a fishing scene on
the river not far from Humpback Falls, where Sam once upon a time had
had such a strenuous adventure. Then of a sudden came the quarrel in
the boat followed by the shooting.

"Say, that looks just as it did when we saw it taken!" exclaimed Sam,
enthusiastically. "This moving picture business is a great thing,
isn't it?"

"It isn't just as we saw it," chuckled Tom. "They didn't show how that
fellow who went overboard came up again and swam ashore."

"Oh, that would spoil the plot of the play," answered his younger
brother.

Other scenes in the drama were shown, one in a barnyard full of cows
being especially realistic. Then came the scene inside the railroad
station at Oak Run, and all of the boys and Dora laughed heartily when
they saw the look of astonishment on old Ricks' face as he peered
through his ticket window at the actor who had come in for a ticket.

"I'd give a dollar to have old Ricks here looking at himself,"
whispered Tom. "Wouldn't he be surprised?"

"Oh, look! look!" exclaimed Dora, in a low tone. "Sam and Tom, I do
declare!"

The scene had shifted suddenly, as do all scenes in moving pictures.
Now was shown the platform of the Oak Run railroad station. The train
was coming in, and there were Sam and Tom as natural as life,
dresssuit cases in hand, ready to get aboard. The train stopped and
some passengers alighted, and Tom and Sam climbed the steps of the
last car.

"And look! Tom is waving his hand to some one," went on Dick's wife.
"Isn't it great!"

As the train began to move away, one of the leading actors in the
drama was seen to rush across the platform and grasp the rail of the
last car. As he was holding himself up, another of the persons in the
drama rushed after the train, shaking his fist wildly; then the train,
with Tom and Sam and the moving picture actor on the back platform,
disappeared from view, and in a twinkling the scene shifted back to
the farmhouse once more.

"Well, we're movies' actors sure enough!" was Tom's comment, after
they had seen the last of the little drama and were out on Broadway
once more. "What do you think of us, Dora?"

"Oh, it was fine, Tom!" she answered. "I'd like to see it again."

"Well, they advertise it for to-morrow, too," said her husband, "so
you can go in the afternoon when we are at the offices."

"I'll certainly do it!"

"I shouldn't mind seeing this picture again myself," said Sam. "If
they have it to-morrow night, let's come up, Tom."

"All right, I'm willing. I suppose they are showing the thing all over
the country."

The next day proved a very busy one for the three Rover boys, and for
the time being the moving picture was completely forgotten. About ten
o'clock, Mr. Powell came to see them regarding an investment which
Anderson Rover had made during the time that Pelter, Japson & Company
were his brokers. This investment now called for a further outlay of a
little over seven thousand dollars, and the boys had to find some
means of raising that amount.

"Now you see if we had those bonds handy, it would be an easy matter
to put some of them up as collateral with some of the banks; but, as
it is, it is going to squeeze us," said Dick.

"And you have got to take care of that other matter of twelve thousand
dollars the middle of next month; don't forget that," broke in the
lawyer. And then he added: "Of course, if you want money to help you
out----"

"Thank you very much, Mr. Powell, but I think I can manage it,"
returned Dick.

He and his brothers had talked their plans over carefully, and had
reached the conclusion that they would not ask for outside assistance
unless it became absolutely necessary. They wanted to show both their
family and their friends that they could "stand on their own bottom,"
as Dick expressed it.

"You have no word in regard to the bonds?" questioned Mr. Powell, when
he was ready to leave.

"Not a word. We hired that detective you recommended, but he said it
was a difficult case to handle, and that we must not expect too much."

When the Rover boys returned late that afternoon to the Outlook Hotel,
they found that Dora had gone out and had not yet returned. She had
left a note on her table stating that she was going to look again at
the moving picture in which Sam and Tom had taken part.

"Oh, yes, we mustn't forget to go there to-night, Sam!" cried Tom.
"It's better than looking at yourself in the looking-glass, isn't it?"
and he grinned.

Six o'clock came, and then half-past, and still Dora did not show
herself. As the time went by, Dick began to get a little worried.

"That show ought to be out by this time," he said to his brothers.
"Generally those moving picture places kind of run down between six
and seven o'clock. If they are continuous they throw in some old stuff
or a lot of advertising matter just to fill in the time."

"Well, maybe she stopped on the way to do some shopping," suggested
Sam. "The stores must prove a great attraction to her."

"She told me yesterday that she was rather tired of shopping,"
answered the young husband. "You see, she went at it pretty strong at
the start, so there isn't so very much left in the way of novelty. I
think I'll go down and look for her;" and a minute later Dick left the
apartment.

"It doesn't take much to worry him when it concerns Dora," remarked
Tom, dryly.

"Well, it wouldn't take much to worry you if it concerned Nellie,"
retorted his younger brother.

"That's true, Sam; and the same would hold good with you if it were
Grace." And then Tom dodged as Sam picked up a sofa pillow and threw,
it at him.

The little French clock belonging to Dora was just chiming out the
hour of seven when the two boys heard Dick and his wife coming through
the hallway. They were talking earnestly, and evidently the young wife
was quite excited.

"Oh, such an experience as I've had!" cried Dora, as she came in and
sank down into an easy chair.

"Well now, try to calm yourself," said Dick, soothingly. "It's all
over now."

"What was it about?" demanded Tom. "Did somebody hold you up, or try
to steal your, purse?"

"Maybe an auto tried to run over you," suggested Sam.

"No, it was none of those things," answered the young wife. "I've just
had the strangest experience!"

"She met that gardener you spoke about-- the fellow who lost his job
at the seminary," explained Dick. "That chap named Andy Royce."

"Why, where did you meet him?" exclaimed Sam. "Did he know you?"

"Yes, he knew me quite well. When I was at Hope he used to do errands
for me now and then and I tipped him quite liberally, so he remembered
me," answered Dora.

"But I met him in the strangest way. He was at the subway station
arguing with the ticket man, who insisted upon it that Royce had not
put a ticket in the box. He wanted the gardener to put another ticket
in, and Royce said he wouldn't do it. They had a very warm dispute,
and a policeman came up to see what it was all about. Then, thinking
that perhaps Royce didn't have any more money with him-- he looked
terribly shabby-- I told him I would get another ticket. Then he
suddenly broke down and I thought he was going to cry. I paid for
another ticket, then the train came along and we both got on board."

  CHAPTER XXIII

 ON THE EAST SIDE

If Royce began to cry there must have been something radically wrong
with him," declared Tom. "Dora, do you think he had been drinking?
Sometimes when men drink they break down and cry, you know."

"I don't know anything about that, Tom; but I do know that he acted
the strangest. I asked him if he was working, and he said no-- that he
had been unable to get a job of any kind. Then I questioned him about
why he had left Hope, and he said it was because he could not get
along with some of the hired help and with Miss Harrow."

"Say!" cried Sam. "Did he say anything about that four-hundred-dollar
diamond ring that was missing?"

"Why, no, Sam. I didn't mention it, and he didn't say anything about
it either. Perhaps he didn't know it was missing."

"Oh, he must know about it," broke in Tom. "It was talked about all
over the place."

"Well, what happened next?" questioned Dick.

"I talked to him for awhile, and I found out that he was out of work
and also out of money. I felt sorry for him, and I offered to lend him
ten dollars," answered Dora. "I hope you don't think I did wrong," she
went on, anxiously.

"You meant well, Dora, I'm sure of that," was Dick's quick reply, "but
whether the money will do this fellow Royce any good or not, is a
question. If he is a drinking man, he'll drink it up very quickly and
that will be the end of it."

"Did he tell you where he was staying?" asked Tom.

"Why, yes, he gave me a slip of paper with his name and address
written on it," answered Dora. "You see, I asked him to do that
because I felt so sorry for him, and I thought that possibly you might
be able to get him something to do;" and she handed the slip of paper
over to her husband.

"'The Golden Oak House,'" read Dick from the slip. "I suppose it is
one of those cheap lodging houses on the East Side," he added. "I'll
keep this, although I don't see how we can help Royce. And besides
that I am not certain that he deserves help. If he had remained
strictly sober he might have kept his job at the seminary. But I'll
think it over," he added, hastily, as he saw that Dora was much
distressed.

"Did you see the moving picture again?" questioned Tom, as all
prepared to go downstairs for dinner.

"Oh, yes!" and the young wife brightened a little. "It certainly is
splendid, Tom! All of you ought to go and see it before they take it
away."

"All right, we'll do it!" said Tom. "That is, Sam and I will go. How
about it, Dick?"

"Oh, I don't know," hesitated the older brother, with a look at Dora.

"You just go, Dick," she cried, quickly. am going to stay here and
write some letters. You go with Tom and Sam and enjoy yourself;" and
so it was arranged.

The boys found the moving picture theater pretty well crowded, and
they had to take seats almost in the rear. Tom and Sam were once more
enjoying the spectacle of looking at themselves when they suddenly
heard a young man behind them utter an exclamation.

"Hello, I know those two fellows!"

They looked around and saw sitting there Barton Pelter. He was gazing
at the play on the screen with great interest.

"Come to see us in the movies, did you?" questioned Tom, as he leaned
back and touched Barton Pelter on the arm. "What do you think of it?"

"Oh, so you are here!" was the reply. "Say, I didn't know you were
movies' actors."

"We are not. We got into that picture quite accidentally," explained
Tom. And then, as the scenes of the drama progressed, he and his
brothers turned their attention to what was going on.

At the end of the photo drama there was a short intermission, during
which a number of persons went out and an even larger number came in.
There was a seat vacated beside the Rovers, and Barton Pelter took
this.

"How are you fellows making out at your offices?" asked the young man.

"Oh, we are doing as well as can be expected," answered Dick. "You
know this sort of thing is rather new to us."

"How about those missing bonds; have you located them yet?"

"No."

"That's too bad," and the young man's face showed his concern. "Have
you any idea where they went to?"

"Not the slightest in the world, Pelter. It is a complete mystery,"
answered Tom.

"The loss of such an amount must hurt you a whole lot," ventured
Barton Pelter, after a slight pause. "It would ruin some folks."

"It does hurt us a whole lot," broke in Sam. "Unless we get those
bonds back-- or at least a part of them-- we are going to have pretty
hard sledding to pull through."

"It's a shame! I wish I could do something to help you, for what you
did for me," returned Barton Pelter; and his voice had a rather
wistful ring in it. Then the theater was darkened and the next photo
drama began.

"Are you doing anything as yet?" questioned Tom, when, at the end of
this play, he saw Jesse Pelter's nephew prepare to leave.

"I've got something of an offer to go on the road as a traveling
salesman for the Consolidated Cream Cracker Company," was the answer.
"It won't pay very much, but it will be better than nothing;" and then
the young man left.

Several days went by and the Rover boys put in all their time at
business. There was a great deal to do in the way of protecting a
number of rather uncertain investments which Pelter, Japson & Company
had made for Mr. Anderson Rover while they were his brokers.

"It's a mighty good thing that we got after Pelter, Japson & Company
when we did," was Erick's comment. "If we hadn't, they would have put
us in the worst kind of a hole, even if they had remained honest. They
had no more conception of what constitutes a good business risk than
has a baby."

"I do hope, Dick, that we make a success of this," returned Tom.

"Oh, don't say we're going to make a fizzle of, it!" cried Sam. "We've
just got to win out, that is all there is to it!"

"Right you are!"

On the following Monday afternoon there was but little for Tom and Sam
to do at the offices, and the former suggested to his younger brother
that they walk over to the East Side and visit The Golden Oak House.

"I've always wanted to see how things look over in that part of New
York," declared Tom, "and if we run into that Andy Royce I'm going to
question him and see if he knows anything about that diamond ring."

"How would he know anything about that, Tom? He wasn't near the house
when the ring was lost. And besides, if he had taken the ring, he
wouldn't be so poverty-stricken. He could pawn a four-hundred-dollar
ring for quite some money."

"I didn't say that he might have taken the ring, Sam. But he was
around the place, and he might have heard something said that would
give us a clew."

"Oh, that might be possible. Anyway, we can question him, just as you
said."

The walk to the East Side was quite a revelation to the Rover boys.
Never had they seen such a congestion of humanity. The stores, the
houses and the sidewalks seemed to be overflowing with people, while
the streets were a jumble of wagons, trucks and push-carts. Every
conceivable sort of a thing seemed to be on sale, and they were
solicited to buy at almost every step.

"They seem to be mostly foreigners over here," was Sam's comment. "I
don't know as I would care to come through here alone at night, Tom."

"Oh, you'd be as safe here as on Broadway," was the reply. "These
people are poor, but you'll find them just as honest as anybody."

The boys had with them the card that Andy Royce had given to Dora, and
it did not take them long to find The Golden Oak House. It was an
old-fashioned, frame building located on the corner of a narrow and
exceedingly dirty alleyway. Downstairs there were a saloon and a
pawnshop. The so-styled office and the sleeping apartments were on the
three floors above.

"Not a very inviting place," were Sam's words, as he looked the resort
over. "Tom, do you think we had better go in?"

"Oh, I don't think it will hurt us," was the answer. "Come ahead!"

Ascending the narrow and exceedingly dirty stairs, the boys passed
through a dingy hall to where a glass door was marked "Office." Inside
they found a small counter and rail, behind which a man in
shirt-sleeves sat smoking a cigar and reading a sporting paper.

"Is there a man stopping here named Andy Royce?" asked Tom, as the man
dropped his paper to look up at the newcomers.

"I think there is, but I don't believe he's in now," was the answer.
"Want to leave any word for him?"

Tom thought for a moment. "Yes," he answered. "I will leave a
message." And taking out one of his cards, he wrote on it: "I'll call
here Tuesday afternoon at about five o'clock to see you."

"Hope you've got work for that fellow. He needs a job the worst way,"
said the hotel man, as he took the card.

"I don't know about a job for him, but perhaps I can help him,"
answered Tom. And then he and Sam left the place.

They had just reached the sidewalk when they beheld Andy Royce coming
towards them. The former gardener of Hope Seminary was partly under
the influence of liquor, and several children were annoying him by
pulling at his coat and calling him names.

"You go 'way an' leave me alone," mumbled the man. And then, as he
caught sight of the Rovers, he tried to brace up.

"Hello, you here!" he exclaimed.

"Yes, we want to talk to you, Royce," answered Tom. Then he motioned
the children away, and led the former gardener of the seminary towards
the alleyway beside the hotel.

  CHAPTER XXIV

 ANDY ROYCE'S CONFESSION

"Want to talk to me, eh?" mumbled Andy Royce. "What you want, anyhow?"

"See here, Royce! what is the use of your drinking like this?" broke
in Sam. "Is that the way to use the money my brother's wife loaned
you?"

"I ain't been drinkin'," mumbled the man. "That is, I ain't had much."

"You've had more than is good for you," put in Tom. "A man like you
ought to leave liquor alone entirely."

"Maybe I would-- if I had a job," growled the former gardener. "But
when a man ain't got no work an' no friends it's pretty hard on him;"
and he showed signs of bursting into tears.

"See here, Royce, you brace up and be a man!" cried Tom. "Because you
haven't any position is no reason at all why you should drink. You
ought to save every cent of your money and make it last as long as
possible."

"All right, just as you say, Mr. Rover," mumbled the man.

It was evident to the youths that the man was in no condition to think
clearly. Evidently he had been drinking more or less for a long while,
for his face showed the signs of this dissipation. His clothing was
ragged, and he was much in need of a shave and a bath. Certainly he
did not look at all like the gardener he had been when he had first
come to Hope.

"See here, Royce, I want to ask you a few questions," said Tom. "Do
you remember about that diamond ring that disappeared at Hope while
you were there?"

"Eh? What?" stammered the former gardener. "Who said I knew anything
about that ring?" and he showed confusion.

"Did you hear anything about it at all?" asked Sam.

"Say, is this a trap?" mumbled the man. "If it is, you ain't goin' to
ketch me in it. Not much you ain't!"

"Look here! If you know anything about this, Royce, you tell us,"
declared Tom, struck by the man's manner.

"I ain't goin' to say nothin'! I didn't steal the ring!" cried Andy
Royce.

"But you know something about it, don't you!" declared Tom, sharply;
and caught the former gardener by the arm.

"Say, you lemme go! I ain't goin' to tell you a thing!" cried the man,
in alarm. "You ain't goin' to trap me like this. I know wot I'm doin'.
Lemme go, I say!" and he tried to break away.

"You're not going a step, Royce, until you tell us the truth,"
declared Tom, now quite satisfied in his own mind that the former
gardener was holding something back.

"If you took that ring you had better confess," broke in Sam.

"I didn't take it, I tell you," muttered Andy Royce. "You ain't goin'
to get nothin' out o' me! This is a put-up job! I won't stand for it!"
And once again he tried to break away. But each of the boys held him
fast.

"I guess the best we can do is to call a policeman and have him locked
up," declared Tom, with a knowing look at his brother. He had no
intention of having the former gardener arrested, but thought the
threat would frighten the fellow. And this was just what it did. At
the mention of being locked up, Andy Royce's courage seemed to leave
him.

"No! No! Don't you do it! Please, gents, don't have me locked up!" be
whined. "I didn't take the ring!"

"But you know what became of it," declared Tom, sternly. "So if you
didn't take it, who did?"

"No-- nobuddy took it," stammered Andy Royce.

"But it's gone," came quickly from Sam.

"Well, if you've got to know the truth, I'll tell you," growled the
man, staring unsteadily at the boys. "It's in Miss Harrow's inkwell."

"Miss Harrow's inkwell!" repeated Tom, incredulously.

"Did you put it there?" questioned Sam.

"I did."

"Well, why in the world did you do that?" asked Tom, and made no
effort to conceal his wonder.

"Why did I do it?" mumbled the man, unsteadily. "I did it to git Miss
Harrow into trouble. I knowed she was responsible for the ring."

"Then you were in the office," declared Sam.

"Sure, I was there! If I wasn't, how would I a-seen that ring? I was
told that Miss Harrow wanted to see me, an' I went to the office just
at the same time when she came down to the stables where me and two of
the other men had had a quarrel. It wasn't my fault, that quarrel
wasn't, but them other fellers put it off on me and said 'twas because
I had been drinkin'," continued Andy Royce, with a whine. "When I got
to the office there wasn't nobuddy around. I saw that diamond ring
layin' on the desk, and I picked it up----"

"You were going to steal it?" broke in Tom.

"No, I wasn't, Mr. Rover. I may drink a little now an' then, but I
ain't no thief," went on Andy Royce. "I never stole anything in my
life. I knowed that ring, because I saw Miss Parsons wear it more than
once. I was mad at Miss Harrow for the way she treated me, an' just
out of mischief I took the ring an' opened the inkwell an' dropped it
in. It was in the inkwell that had red ink in it, an' the ring went
plumb out o' sight."

"And you left the ring in the inkwell?" queried Tom.

"Sure I did! Then, not to be seen in the office, I slipped out in a
hurry, an' left the seminary by the back door an' ran to the stables.
Miss Harrow was there. She had told me that she was goin' to discharge
me if there was any more trouble, so I knowed wot was comin'. Then I
quit, an' come away," concluded Andy Royce.

"Well, of all the things I ever heard of, this takes the cake!" was
Sam's comment.

"If this fellow's story is true, the ring ought to be in the inkwell
yet," said Tom. "That is, unless the well was washed out and put away
for the summer. In that case the person who cleaned the well ought to
have found the ring."

"Sounds almost like a fairy tale," went on Sam. "I don't know whether
to believe it or, not."

"It's the truth!" cried Andy Royce.

"We'll believe it when we see the ring," returned Tom, grimly. "I
guess the best thing you can do, Royce, is to come with us."

"Please don't have me arrested! I've told you the truth, sure!"

"If you'll come with us and behave yourself, we won't have you
arrested," answered Tom. "But we are not going to let you get away
until we have found out if your story is true."

"We might telegraph to the seminary at once," suggested Sam. "Do you
know who is in charge there during the summer?"

"Why, I heard Nellie say that Miss Parsons took charge-- the teacher
who left the ring with Miss Harrow."

"Then why not telegraph to her?"

"We'll do it! But this fellow has got to come with us until we are
sure his story is true."

Andy Royce demurred, but the boys would not listen to him. They
accompanied him to his room upstairs, and made him pack up his
belongings and pay his bill. Then, somewhat sobered by what was taking
place, the gardener accompanied them downstairs and to the street.
Here the boys hailed a passing taxicab that was empty, and ordered the
driver to take them as quickly as possible to the Outlook Hotel.

"It certainly is a queer story," said Dick, who had just arrived from
the office, "but it may be true. People do queer things sometimes,
especially when they are under the influence of liquor. He probably
had a grudge against Miss Harrow, and thought the disappearance of the
ring would get her into trouble, just as he said."

"Oh, I hope they do find the ring!" cried Tom. "It will be great news
for Nellie."

It was arranged that Andy Royce should accompany Dick and Sam to the
smoking room of the hotel, and remain there until Tom had telegraphed
to Hope Seminary and received a reply.

"You had better run upstairs and see Dora first," suggested Dick, "and
make sure as to who is in charge at the seminary. If there are two
persons there, you had better telegraph to both of them so that they
can unite in looking for the ring."

Dora was in a flutter of excitement when told of what had occurred.
She remembered about Miss Parsons, and said that there was also a
housekeeper named Mrs. Lacy in charge. Armed with this information Tom
sent off two telegrams, each reading as follows:

  "Look for missing diamond ring in Miss Harrow's red-ink inkwell. If
  found, answer at once.

                                                        Thomas Rover,
                                                      "Outlook Hotel,
                                                     "New York City."

"They were mighty funny telegrams to send," said Tom, when he rejoined
his brothers in the hotel smoking room. "Perhaps they won't know what
to make of them."

"I am afraid we'll have to wait quite a while for an answer," returned
Dick.

"Oh, I don't know. They can telephone the messages up to the seminary
from the telegraph office."

"They'll find the ring just as I said unless somebuddy cleaned out the
inkwell and took it," declared Andy Royce, who was rapidly sobering up
because of the turn of affairs.

As it was getting late, it was decided that Dick should go to dinner
with Dora as usual, while Tom and Sam took the former gardener to a
corner of the restaurant for something to eat.

"I don't feel much like filling up," said Sam. "I'm on pins and
needles about an answer to those messages you sent, Tom."

"Exactly the way I feel, Sam. But we'll have to have patience, I
suppose."

The meal at an end, Dora went upstairs, and Dick rejoined his brothers
and Andy Royce in the smoking room. Tom had left word at the hotel
telegraph office that any message which might come in for hire must be
delivered at once.

"Here comes a bellboy now!" cried Dick, presently.

"Mr. Rover! Mr. Rover!" cried the boy, walking from one group of
persons to another.

"Here you are! here you are, boy!" cried Tom, leaping up; and in
another moment he had a telegram in his hand and was tearing it open
to see what it contained.

  CHAPTER XXV

 MORE TELEGRAMS

"Who is it from, Tom?"

"Read it out loud!"

Such were the exclamations from Sam and Dick as their brother scanned
the telegram in haste.

"Hurrah! they've found it!" broke out Tom. "This is the best yet!"

"Good!"

"Fine!"

"This is from Miss Clara Parsons," went on Tom, "the teacher who owned
the ring. Here, you can read the telegram if you want to," and he
passed the sheet over. The message ran as follows:

  "Ring found in inkwell. Perfect condition. Did Miss Laning put it
  there?

                                                     "Clara Parsons."

"Short and sweet, but it tells the story," was Dick's comment. "Say,
I'm mighty glad of this," he added, and his face showed his pleasure.
"That clears Nellie, Tom. You'll have to let her know at once."

"I sure will!" exclaimed the brother. "But say, did you notice what
Miss Parsons wants to know-- if Nellie put the ring in the inkwell?
Talk about nerve!"

"You can't exactly blame her, Tom, because she knew nothing of Royce's
visit to the office; and as you sent the message, and you and Nellie
are so intimate

"Oh, I understand, Dick; and I shan't blame her. I'm too happy to
blame anybody," and Tom's face broke into a broad smile. "I'm going to
send a telegram to Cedarville this minute."

"Didn't I tell you gents the ring was there?" broke in Andy Royce. "I
told you the truth, didn't I?"

"You did, Royce," answered Dick.

"A'n' wot about it, are you goin' to lemme go?" questioned the former
gardener, eagerly.

"Not just yet," broke in Tom.

"Why not? You can't hold me for stealin' when there wasn't nuthin'
taken."

"That is true, Royce, but we want you to sign a confession as to just
how that ring got in the inkwell. If you don't do that, the seminary
authorities may still think it was placed there by Miss Laning."

"Oh, I don't want to put nuthin' off on Miss Laning's shoulders,"
answered the former gardener. "If you want a confession from me so as
you can clear her, go ahead!"

"Wait here until I've sent that telegram," Tom said, hastily; and
rushed off once more to the telegraph office, where he sent the
following to Nellie:

  "Ring recovered. Was hidden in inkwell by Royce. We have gardener's
  confession. Hurrah! Will write particulars.

                                                               "Tom."

"I hope she gets that before she goes to bed to-night," mused the
youth. "If she does it will make her sleep so much better."

There was a stenographer's office attached to the Outlook Hotel, and
late as it was, the young lady was found at her typewriter, pounding
out a letter for a commercial traveler. As soon as this was finished,
the stenographer was asked to take down whatever Andy Royce might have
to tell. The former gardener was brought in, and repeated the
confession he had previously made. This was typewritten as speedily as
possible, and then Andy Royce signed the confession in the presence of
one of the hotel clerks and a notary who lived at the hotel.

"Now I think that fixes it," said Tom. "Miss Parsons won't be able to
go behind that confession."

"Are you goin' to let me go now?" asked the former gardener of Hope.

"Yes, you can go, Royce," answered Tom. "But wait a minute. How much
money have you left of that ten dollars my brother's wife let you
have?"

For reply the man dove down in his pocket, and brought out some
change.

"Eighty-five cents."

"That's all?"

"Yes."

"See here, if I stake you with another ten dollars, will you give me
your word not to drink it up?"

"I will, Mr. Rover, I will!" exclaimed Andy Royce, earnestly.

"All right, then, here's the money;" and Tom brought out two
five-dollar bills and placed them in the man's hands. "Now look here,
unless you can find something to do, you come here and see me again in
a few days."

"But see here, Tom," interposed Dick, in a low voice, "I don't think
we can use Royce in anyway. Why not let him go? As a gardener he is
out of place in a big city like New York."

"I want him to stay here for two reasons," answered Tom. "In the first
place I want him on hand in case the authorities at the seminary need
him. In the second place, I am going to put the matter squarely up to
Miss Harrow. She thought Nellie guilty, and she may have thought Royce
worse than he really was. Perhaps I can get her to give Royce another
chance. I think he would be all right if he would only let drink
alone."

"The same old warm-hearted Tom as of old!" responded Dick. "All right,
have your own way about it."

After the former gardener had departed the boys went upstairs to join
Dora, and then Tom and Sam sat down to write letters of explanation to
Nellie and Grace; and these epistles were posted before the youths
retired for the night.

"Oh, how glad Nellie must be to have this weight off her shoulders!"
exclaimed Dora. "It must have been awful to be suspected of taking a
ring."

"I guess Miss Harrow will be relieved, too," answered Tom. "I wonder
where she is stopping in Asbury Park."

"I think I know," returned Dick's wife. "She and some of the other
teachers usually go to the Claravale House."

"I'll take a chance and telegraph to her," went on Tom. "It won't cost
much and it may relieve her mind. Those folks up at the seminary may
wait to send a letter." And going downstairs once more, Tom wrote out
another brief telegram, and asked that it be sent off immediately.

"If only we could clear up this mystery of the missing bonds as easily
as we did this ring business!" came from Sam, when he and Tom had said
good-night to Dick and his wife.

"I'm afraid that's not going to be so easy, Sam. Sometimes I think
that we'll never hear a word more about those bonds;" and Tom heaved a
deep sigh.

"Oh, but, Tom, if we don't get those bonds back we'll be in a hole!"
cried the youngest Rover, in dismay.

"We may not be in a hole exactly, Sam; but we'll have a tough job of
it pulling through," was the grim response.

Tom had worried more about the missing ring than he had been willing
to admit to his brothers, and now that this was off his mind, he, on
the following morning, pitched into business with renewed vigor. He
and Dick had their hands full, going over a great mass of figures and
calculations, and in deciding the important question of how to take
care of certain investments. Sam did what he could to help them,
although, as he frankly admitted, he did not take to bookkeeping or
anything that smacked of high finances.

"I was not cut out for it, and that is all there is to it," he
declared. "But I am willing to help you all I can."

Sam had gone off on an errand, leaving his brothers deep in their
figures, when the office boy announced a visitor.

"Mr. Mallin Aronson," said Dick, glancing at the visitor's card. "Oh,
yes, I've heard of him before. He and father had some stock dealings a
year or so ago. Bring him in."

Mr. Aronson proved to be a small, dark-complexioned man, with heavy
eyebrows and a heavily-bearded face. He bowed profoundly as he
entered.

"Mr. Richard Rover, I believe?" he said, extending his hand.

"Yes, Mr. Aronson. And this is my brother Tom," returned Dick.

"Very glad to know you;" and the visitor bowed again. "I presume you
know what brought me here," he went on, with a bland smile.

"I can't say that I do," returned Dick.

"Your father-- is he not here?"

"No, he is at home sick."

"Is that so? I am very sorry to hear it. Then you are transacting his
business for him?"

"Yes, my brother and I are running this business now."

"And yet you said you did not know why I had called," continued Mr.
Aronson, in apparent astonishment. "That is strange. Did not your
father tell you about his investment in the Sharon Valley Land
Company?"

"I never heard of the company before," returned Dick, promptly.

"I heard my father mention it," put in Tom, "but I never knew that he
had made any investment in it."

"What? How surprising!" ejaculated the visitor. "He has something like
fifteen thousand dollars invested in that concern, for which I have
the honor to be the agent. He has another payment to make on the
investment, and that payment falls due just a week from to-day. Some
time ago he asked me if that payment might not be deferred. I put it
up to the managers of the company, and they have now sent me word that
the payment will have to be made on the day that it falls due."

"And how much is that payment?" faltered Dick.

"Twenty thousand dollars."

  CHAPTER XXVI

 IN WHICH THE GIRLS ARRIVE

Both of the Rover boys stared blankly at the visitor. His announcement
had come very much like a clap of thunder out of a clear sky. For the
moment neither of them knew what to say.

"I am sorry you did not know about this," pursued Mallin Aronson, when
he saw by their looks how much they were disturbed. "Perhaps your dear
father was taken sick so quickly that he did not have a chance to
explain the situation."

"He hasn't been well for a long while, but I thought he had turned
over all his business affairs to us," answered Dick. "It is queer that
we have no record of this Sharon Valley Land Company investment," he
added, turning to Tom.

"Have you gone over all the papers, Dick?" questioned the brother,
quickly.

"The most of them. That is, all that I thought were of any importance.
There are a great number that I haven't had time to look at yet. You
know how numerous father's investments are."

"If you have no record of the transaction here, can you not ask your
father about it?" questioned Mr. Aronson, smoothly.

"He is too sick to be disturbed, Mr. Aronson," answered Dick.

"Well, if you care to do so, you can stop at my office and look over
the account there," went on the visitor.

"And you say this twenty thousand dollars has got to be paid a week
from to-day?" asked Tom.

"Yes, Mr. Rover. The management will grant no extension of time."

"Supposing it isn't paid?" questioned Dick.

At this suggestion Mallin Aronson shrugged his shoulders and put up
his hands.

"I am sorry, but you know how some of these land company people are,"
he returned. "This money must be paid in order to clear the land. If
it is not cleared the company has the right to sell your father's
interest to others. As I said before, he has paid fifteen thousand
dollars. What his interest would bring if sold to somebody else, I do
not know."

"Probably not very much," returned Dick, quickly. "Probably some of
the land company people would buy it in for a song," he added,
bitterly.

"Well, Mr. Rover, that is not my affair," and Mr. Aronson shrugged his
shoulders. "I came in only to serve you notice that the twenty
thousand dollars will have to be paid one week from to-day."

"Where are your offices, Mr. Aronson?"

"You will find my address on the card," was the answer. "If you wish
any more information, I shall be pleased to give it to you;" and then
the visitor bowed himself out.

It was a great blow, and the two youths felt it keenly. Ever since the
loss of the sixty-four thousand dollars in bonds they had been
struggling with might and main to cover one obligation after another.
To do this had taxed about every resource that Dick could think of
aside from borrowing from friends without putting up any security--
something the youth shrank from doing.

"Say, Dick, this is fierce!" exclaimed Tom. "What are we going to do
about it?"

"I don't know yet," was the slow reply. can't understand why father
didn't mention this investment to me."

"He must have felt so sick that he forgot all about it. You don't
imagine that there is anything wrong about it?"

"Oh, no! I guess it is all straight enough. Aronson must know that he
couldn't get any such money out of us unless everything was as
straight as a string."

"Perhaps Mr. Powell could get the twenty thousand dollars for us."

"Maybe he could. But that isn't the point, Tom. A hundred ways Jo had
tried to rouse his memory. But the words Cote Dorion had no meaning
to him, and he listened blankly to all names and phrases once
so familiar.

Yet he spoke French and English in a slow, passive, involuntary way.
All was automatic, mechanical.

The weeks again wore on, and autumn became winter, and then at last one
day the Cure came, bringing his brother, a great Parisian surgeon
lately arrived from France on a short visit.

The Cure had told his brother the story, and had been met by a keen,
astonished interest in the unknown man on Vadrome Mountain.

A slight pressure on the brain from accident had before now produced
loss of memory--the great man's professional curiosity was aroused:
he saw a nice piece of surgical work ready to his hand; he asked
to be taken to Vadrome Mountain.

Now the Cure had lived long out of the world, and was not in touch
with the swift-minded action and adventuring intellects of such
men as his brother, Marcel Loisel.

Was it not tempting Providence, a surgical operation? He was so
used to people getting ill and getting well without a doctor--the nearest
was twenty miles distant--or getting ill and dying in what seemed
a natural and preordained way, that to cut open a man's head and
look into his brain, and do this or that to his skull, seemed almost
sinful.

Was it not better to wait and see if the poor man would not recover
in God's appointed time?

In answer to his sensitively eager and diverse questions, Marcel Loisel
replied that his dear Cure was merely mediaeval, and that he had
sacrificed his mental powers on the altar of a simple faith, which
might remove mountains but was of no value in a case like this,
where, clearly, surgery was the only providence.

At this the Cure got to his feet, came over, laid his hand on his
brother's shoulder, and said, with tears in his eyes:
"Marcel, you shock me.

Indeed you shock me!"
Then he twisted a knot in his cassock cords, and added "Come then,
Marcel.

We will go to him. And may God guide us aright!"
That afternoon the two grey-haired men visited Vadrome Mountain,
and there they found Charley at work in the little room that the
two men had built.

Charley nodded pleasantly when the Cure introduced his brother,
but showed no further interest at first.

He went on working at the cupboard under his hand. His cap was off
and his hair was a little rumpled where the wound had been, for
he had a habit of rubbing the place now and then--an abstracted,
sensitive motion--although he seemed to suffer no pain.

The surgeon's eyes fastened on the place, and as Charley worked and his
brother talked, he studied the man, the scar, the contour of the
head. At last he came up to Charley and softly placed his fingers
on the scar, feeling the skull. Charley turned quickly.

There was something in the long, piercing look of the surgeon which
seemed to come through limitless space to the sleeping and imprisoned
memory of Charley's sick mind.

A confused, anxious, half-fearful look crept into the wide blue eyes.
It was like a troubled ghost, flitting along the boundaries of
sight and sense, and leaving a chill and a horrified wonder behind.

The surgeon gazed on, and the trouble in Charley's eye passed to his
face, stayed an instant. Then he turned away to Jo Portugais.

"I am thirsty now," he said, and he touched his lips in the way he was
wont to do in those countless ages ago, when, millions upon
millions of miles away, people said: "There goes Charley Steele!"

"I am thirsty now," and that touch of the lip with the tongue, were a
revelation to the surgeon.

A half-hour later he was walking homeward with the Cure.

Jo accompanied them for a distance. As they emerged into the wider
road-paths that began half-way down the mountain, the Cure, who
had watched his brother's face for a long time in silence, said:
"What is in your mind, Marcel?"

The surgeon turned with a half-smile.

"He is happy now.

No memory, no conscience, no pain, no responsibility, no trouble--nothing
behind or before.

Is it good to bring him back?"
The Cure had thought it all over, and he had wholly changed his
mind since that first talk with his brother.

"To save a mind, Marcel!" he said.

"Then to save a soul?" suggested the surgeon. "Would he thank
me?"

"It is our duty to save him."
"Body and mind and soul, eh?

And if I look after the body and the mind?"
"His soul is in God's hands, Marcel."
"But will he thank me? How can you tell what sorrows, what troubles,
he has had? What struggles, temptations, sins?

He has none now, of any sort; not a stain, physical or moral."
"That is not life, Marcel."
"Well, well, you have changed. This morning it was I who would, and you
hesitated."
"I see differently now, Marcel."

The surgeon put a hand playfully on his brother's shoulder.

"Did you think, my dear Prosper, that I should hesitate?

Am I a sentimentalist? But what will he say?

"We need not think of that, Marcel."
"But yet suppose that with memory come again sin and shame--even
crime?"

"We will pray for him."
"But if he isn't a Catholic?"

"One must pray for sinners," said the Curb, after a silence.

This time the surgeon laid a hand on the shoulder of his brother
affectionately.

"Upon my soul, dear Prosper, you almost persuade me to be reactionary
and mediaeval."

The Curb turned half uneasily towards Jo, who was following at a little
distance. This seemed hardly the sort of thing for him to
hear.

"You had better return now, Jo," he said.

"As you wish, M'sieu'," Jo answered, then looked inquiringly at the
surgeon.

"In about five days, Portugais.

Have you a steady hand and a quick eye?"
Jo spread out his hands in deprecation, and turned to the Curb, as
though for him to answer.

  "Jo is something of a physician and surgeon too, Marcel.

 He has a gift.

He has cured many in the parish with his herbs and tinctures, and
he has set legs and arms successfully."
The surgeon eyed Jo humorously, but kindly. "He is probably as good a
doctor as some of us. Medicine is a gift, surgery is a gift and an
art.

You shall hear from me, Portugais." He looked again keenly at
Jo. "You have not given him 'herbs and tinctures'?"
"Nothing, M'sieu'."

"Very sensible. Good-day, Portugais."
"Good-day, my son," said the priest, and raised his fingers in
benediction, as Jo turned and quickly retraced his steps.

"Why did you ask him if he had given the poor man any herbs or tinctures,
Marcel?" said the priest.

"Because those quack tinctures have whiskey in them."
"What do you mean?"
"Whiskey in any form would be bad for him," the surgeon answered
evasively.

But to himself he kept saying: "The man was a drunkard--he was a
drunkard."

CHAPTER XI

  THE RAISING OF THE CURTAIN
  M.

Marcel Loisel did his work with a masterly precision, with the aid
of his brother and Portugais.

The man under the instruments, not wholly insensible, groaned once
or twice.

Once or twice, too, his eyes opened with a dumb hunted look, then
closed as with an irresistible weariness.

When the work was over, and every stain or sign of surgery removed,
sleep came down on the bed--a deep and saturating sleep, which seemed
to fill the room with peace.

For hours the surgeon sat beside the couch, now and again feeling the
pulse, wetting the hot lips, touching the forehead with his palm.

At last, with a look of satisfaction, he came forward to where Jo and
the Cure sat beside the fire.

"It is all right," he said. "Let him sleep as long as he will." He
turned again to the bed.

"I wish I could stay to see the end of it. Is there no chance, Prosper?"
he added to the priest.

"Impossible, Marcel. You must have sleep.

You have a seventy-mile drive before you to-morrow, and sixty the
next day. You can only reach the port now by starting at daylight
to-morrow."

So it was that Marcel Loisel, the great surgeon, was compelled to leave
Chaudiere before he knew that the memory of the man who had been
under his knife had actually returned to him.

He had, however, no doubt in his own mind, and he was confident that
there could be no physical harm from the operation. Sleep was the
all-important thing.

In it lay the strength for the shock of the awakening--if awakening of
memory there was to be.

Before he left he stooped over Charley and said musingly: "I wonder
what you will wake up to, my friend?"

Then he touched the wound with a light caressing finger. "It was well
done, well done," he murmured proudly.

A moment afterwards he was hurrying down the hill to the open road,
where a cariole awaited the Cure and himself.

For a day and a half Charley slept, and Jo watched him with an
affectionate solicitude. Once or twice, becoming anxious, because
of the heavy breathing and the motionless sleep, he had forced open the
teeth, and poured a little broth between.

Just before dawn on the second morning, worn out and heavy with slumber,
Jo lay down by the piled-up fire and dropped into a sleep that
wrapped him like a blanket, folding him away into a drenching
darkness.

For a time there was a deep silence, troubled only by Jo's deep
breathing, which seemed itself like the pulse of the silence. Charley
appeared not to be breathing at all. He was lying on his back,
seemingly lifeless. Suddenly on the snug silence there was a sharp
sound. A tree outside snapped with the frost.

Charley awoke. The body seemed not to awake, for it did not stir, but
the eyes opened wide and full, looking straight before them--straight
up to the brown smoke-stained rafters, along which were ranged
guns and fishing-tackle, axes and bear-traps. Full clear blue eyes,
healthy and untired as a child's fresh from an all-night's drowse,
they looked and looked.

Yet, at first, the body did not stir; only the mind seemed to be awakening,
the soul creeping out from slumber into the day. Presently, however,
as the eyes gazed, there stole into them a wonder, a trouble, an
anxiety.

For a moment they strained at the rafters and the crude weapons and
implements there, then the body moved, quickly, eagerly, and turned
to see the flickering shadows made by the fire and the simple order
of the room.

A minute more, and Charley was sitting on the side of his couch,
dazed and staring.

This hut, this fire, the figure by the hearth in a sound sleep-his
hand went to his head: it felt the bandage there!

He remembered now! Last night at the Cote Dorion! Last night he had
talked with Suzon Charlemagne at the Cote Dorion; last night he
had drunk harder than he had ever drunk in his life, he had defied,
chaffed, insulted the river-drivers.

The whole scene came back: the faces of Suzon and her father; Suzon's
fingers on his for an instant; the glass of brandy beside him; the
lanterns on the walls; the hymn he sang; the sermon he preached--he
shuddered a little; the rumble of angry noises round him; the tumbler
thrown; the crash of the lantern, and only one light left in the
place!

Then Jake Hough and his heavy hand, the flying monocle, and his disdainful,
insulting reply; the sight of the pistol in the hand of Suzon's
father; then a rush, a darkness, and his own fierce plunge towards
the door, beyond which were the stars and the cool night and the
dark river.

Curses, hands that battered and tore at him, the doorway reached, and
then a blow on the head and--falling, falling, falling, and distant
noises growing more distant, and suddenly and sweetly--absolute
silence.

Again he shuddered. Why? He remembered that scene in his office yesterday
with Kathleen, and the one later with Billy. A sensitive chill swept
all over him, making his flesh creep, and a flush sped over his face
from chin to brow. To-day he must pick up all these threads again,
must make things right for Billy, must replace the money he had
stolen, must face Kathleen again he shuddered.

Was he at the Cote Dorion still? He looked round him. No, this
was not the sort of house to be found at the Cote Dorion.

Clearly this was the hut of a hunter. Probably he had been fished
out of the river by this woodsman and brought here. He felt his head.
The wound was fresh and very sore.

He had played for death, with an insulting disdain, yet here he was
alive.

Certainly he was not intended to be drowned or knifed--he remembered
the knives he saw unsheathed--or kicked or pummelled into the hereafter.
It was about ten o'clock when he had had his "accident"--he affected
a smile, yet somehow he did not smile easily--it must be now about
five, for here was the morning creeping in behind the deer-skin
blind at the window.

Strange that he felt none the worse for his mishap, and his tongue
was as clean and fresh as if he had been drinking milk last night,
and not very doubtful brandy at the Cote Dorion.

No fever in his hands, no headache, only the sore skull, so well and
tightly bandaged but a wonderful thirst, and an intolerable hunger.
He smiled. When had he ever been hungry for breakfast before?

Here he was with a fine appetite: it was like coals of fire heaped
on his head by Nature for last night's business at the Cote Dorion.

How true it was that penalties did not always come with--indiscretions.

Yet, all at once, he flushed again to the forehead, for a curious sense
of shame flashed through his whole being, and one Charley Steele--the
Charley Steele of this morning, an unknown, unadventuring, onlooking
Charley Steele--was viewing with abashed eyes the Charley Steele
who had ended a doubtful career in the coarse and desperate proceedings
of last night.

With a nervous confusion he sought refuge in his eye-glass.

His fingers fumbled over his waistcoat, but did not find it.
The weapon of defence and attack, the symbol of interrogation and
incomprehensibility, was gone. Beauty Steele was under the eyes of
another self, and neither disdain, nor contempt, nor the passive
stare, were available.

He got suddenly to his feet, and started forward, as though to find
refuge from himself.

The abrupt action sent the blood to his head, and feeling a blindness
come over him, he put both hands up to his temples, and sank back
on the couch, dizzy and faint.

His motions waked Jo Portugais, who scrambled from the floor, and came
towards him.

"M'sieu'," he said, "you must not. You are faint." He dropped his hands
supportingly to Charley's shoulders.

Charley nodded, but did not yet look up. His head throbbed
sorely.
"Water--please!"

he said.

In an instant Jo was beside him again, with a bowl of fresh water at
his lips.

  He drank, drank, drank, until the great bowl was drained to the
last drop.

 "Whew! That was good!"

he said, and looked up at Jo with a smile. "Thank you, my friend; I
haven't the honour of your acquaintance, but--"
He stopped suddenly and stared at Jo. Inquiry, mystification, were in
his look.

"Have I ever seen you before?"

he said. "Who knows, M'sieu'!"
Since Jo had stood before Charley in the dock near six years ago he
had greatly changed. The marks of smallpox, a heavy beard, grey hair,
and solitary life had altered him beyond Charley's recognition.

Jo could hardly speak. His legs were trembling under him, for now he
knew that Charley Steele was himself again. He was no longer the
simple, quiet man-child of three days ago, and of these months past,
but the man who had saved him from hanging, to whom he owed a debt
he dare not acknowledge.

Jo's brain was in a muddle. Now that the great crisis was over, now
that the expected thing had come, and face to face with the cure,
he had neither tongue, nor strength, nor wit.

His words stuck in his throat where his heart was, and for a minute
his eyes had a kind of mist before them.

Meanwhile Charley's eyes were upon him, curious, fixed, abstracted.

"Is this your house?"
"It is, M'sieu'."
"You fished me out of the river by the Cote Dorion?"

He still held his head with his hands, for it throbbed so, but his
eyes were intent on his companion.

"Yes, M'sieu'."
Charley's hand mechanically fumbled for his monocle. Jo turned quickly
to the wall, and taking it by its cord from the nail where it had been
for these long months, handed it over.

Charley took it and mechanically put it in his eye. "Thank you, my
friend," he said. "Have I been conscious at all since you rescued
me last night?"

he asked.

"In a way, M'sieu'."
"Ah, well, I can't remember, but it was very kind of you--I do thank you
very much. Do you think you could find me something to eat? I beg your
pardon--it isn't breakfast-time, of course, but I was never so
hungry in my life!"

"In a minute, M'sieu'--in one minute. But lie down, you must lie
down a little.

You got up too quick, and it makes your head throb.

You have had nothing to eat."

"Nothing, since yesterday noon, and very little then.

I didn't eat anything at the Cote Dorion, I remember." He lay back on
the couch and closed his eyes.

The throbbing in his head presently stopped, and he felt that if
he ate something he could go to sleep again, it was so restful in
this place--a whole day's sleep and rest, how good it would be after
last night's racketing!

Here was primitive and material comfort, the secret of content, if
you liked!

Here was this poor hunter-fellow, with enough to eat and to drink,
earning it every day by every day's labour, and, like Robinson
Crusoe no doubt, living in a serene self-sufficiency and an elysian
retirement.

Probably he had no responsibilities in the world, with no one
to say him nay, himself only to consider in all the universe:
a divine conception of adequate life.

Yet himself, Charley Steele, an idler, a waster, with no purpose
in life, with scarcely the necessity to earn his bread-never, at
any rate, until lately--was the slave of the civilisation to which
he belonged.

Was civilisation worth the game?

His hand involuntarily went to his head.

It changed the course of his thoughts. He must go back to-day to put
Billy's crime right, to replace the trust-moneys Billy had taken
by forging his brother-in-law's name.
Not a moment must be lost. No doubt he was within driving distance of
his office, and, bandaged head or no bandaged head, last night's
disgraceful doings notwithstanding, it was his duty to face the
wondering eyes--what did he care for wondering eyes?

hadn't he been making eyes wonder all his life?--face the wondering
eyes in the little city, and set a crooked business straight. Fool
and scoundrel certainly Billy was, but there was Kathleen!

His lips tightened; he had a strange anxious flutter of the heart. When
had his heart fluttered like this?

When had he ever before considered Kathleen's feelings as to his
personal conduct so delicately? Well, since yesterday he did feel it,
and a sudden sense of pity sprang up in him--vague, shamefaced pity,
which belied the sudden egotistical flourish with which he put his
monocle to his eye and tried futilely to smile in the old way.

He had lain with his eyes closed. They opened now, and he saw his
host spreading a newspaper as a kind of cloth on a small rough
table, and putting some food upon it-bread, meat, and a bowl of soup.

It was thoughtful of this man to make his soup overnight-he saw Jo lift
it from beside the fire where it had been kept hot.

A good fellow-an excellent fellow, this woodsman.

His head did not throb now, and he drew himself up slowly on his
elbow-then, after a moment, lifted himself to a sitting posture.

"What is your name, my friend?" he said.

"Jo Portugais, M'sieu'," Jo answered, and brought a candle and put it
on the table, then lifted the tin-plate from over the bowl of
savoury soup.

Never before had Charley Steele sat down to such a breakfast. A roll and
a cup of coffee had been enough, and often too much, for him.

Yet now he could not wait to eat the soup with a spoon, but lifted
the bowl and took a long draught of it, and set it down with a
sigh of content.

Then he broke bread into the soup--large pieces of black oat
bread--until the bowl was a mass of luscious pulp. This he ate
almost ravenously, his eye wandering avidly the while to the small
piece of meat beside the bowl.

What meat was it? It looked like venison, yet summer was not the time
for venison.

What did it matter! Jo sat on a bench beside the fire, his face turned
towards his guest, dreading the moment when the man he had nursed
and cared for, with whom he had eaten and drunk for so long, should
know the truth about himself.

He could not tell him all there was to tell, he was taking another means
of letting him know.

Charley did not speak. Hunger was a new sensation, a
delicious thing, too good to be broken by talking.

He ate till he had cleared away the last crumbs of bread and meat
and drunk the last drop of soup.

He looked at the woodsman as though wondering if he would bring more.

Jo evidently thought he had had enough, for he did not move. Charley's
glance withdrew from Jo, and busied itself with the few crumbs
remaining upon the table.
He saw a little piece of bread on the floor.

He picked it up and ate it with relish, laughing to himself.

"How long will it take us to get to town?

Can we do it this morning?"

"Not this morning, M'sieu'," said Jo, in a sort of hoarse whisper.

"How many hours would it take?"
He was gathering the last crumbs of his feast with his hand, and looking
casually down at the newspaper spread as a table-cloth.

All at once his hand stopped, his eyes became fixed on a spot in
the paper.

He gave a hoarse, guttural cry, like an animal in agony. His
lips became dry, his hand wiped a blinding mist from his eyes.

Jo watched him with an intense alarm and a horrified curiosity.

He felt a base coward for not having told Charley what this paper
contained.

Never had he seen such a look as this.

He felt his beads, and told them over and over again, as Charley
Steele, in a dry, croaking sort of whisper, read, in letters that
seemed monstrous symbols of fire, a record of himself:
"To-day, by special license from the civil and ecclesiastical courts
[the paragraph in the paper began], was married, at St.

Theobald's Church, Mrs. Charles Steele, daughter of the late Hon.
Julien Wantage, and niece of the late Eustace Wantage, Esq., to Captain
Thomas Fairing, of the Royal Fusileers--"
Charley snatched at the top of the paper and read the date "Tenth
of February, 18-!"

It was August when he was at the Cote Dorion, the 5th August, 18-,
and this paper was February 10th, 18-.

He read on, in the month-old paper, with every nerve in his body
throbbing now: a fierce beating that seemed as if it must burst the
heart and the veins:

"--Captain Thomas Fairing, of the Royal Fusileers, whose career in
our midst has been marked by an honourable sense of public and
private duty.

Our fellow-citizens will unite with us in congratulating the
bride, whose previous misfortunes have only increased the respect
in which she is held.

They found that the
man lived quite a distance out, in the Germantown section.

"Let's hire a taxi, and get out there as fast as we can," suggested
Dick. Now that they were actually on the trail of the missing broker
he was anxious to bring the pursuit to an end.

Outside the railroad station taxicabs were numerous, and the boys
quickly hired one of the best of the machines and gave the driver
directions where to go.

"And don't lose any time," ordered Dick.

"I'll run as fast as I dare," returned the chauffeur.

The ride to Crowley Pelter's residence took a good three-quarters of
an hour. The place was a small but well-kept one on a corner.

"I guess I had better go in alone," suggested Dick. "If I need you
I'll whistle or wave my handkerchief;" and then he ran up the front
steps and rang the bell. A tall, angular woman, wearing large
spectacles, soon answered his summons.

"Good afternoon," said Dick, politely. "Is this Mr. Crowley Pelter's
residence?"

"Yes, sir."

"I believe Mr. Jesse Pelter is staying here. Can I see him?" went on
Dick.

"Mr. Jesse Pelter was staying here, but he has just gone-- he went
about an hour ago."

"Is that so!" cried Dick. "Can you tell me where he went to?"

"Well, I-- er-- I don't know," faltered the woman, and eyed Dick
sharply.

"I have a very important message for him," Dick hastened to say. "I
must see him at once."

"Oh, in that case you'll find him down at the docks. He has engaged
passage on the Princess Lenida bound for Liverpool."

"And when does the Princess Lenida sail?" asked Dick, quickly.

"I don't know exactly. Either this afternoon or to-morrow morning."

"And you are sure he has gone to the steamer?"

"Oh, yes. He sent his baggage off this morning, and he said he would
not be back."

"Thank you, Madam." And without another word Dick turned and left the
residence.

As he did this he saw a man he knew hurrying along the street. The man
stopped when he caught sight of Dick and the two boys in the taxicab.

"Why, you here, Mr. Bronson?" cried Dick.

"Hello! how in the world did you fellows get here!" exclaimed the
detective the Rovers had hired but a short time before. "Are you on
the trail of Pelter, too?"

"We are," answered Dick. "How did you learn he had been here?"

"Had been! Do you mean to say he has left?"

"Yes. The woman who came to the door told me he had left about an hour
ago. He is going to sail on the Princess Lenida for Liverpool either
this afternoon or to-morrow morning."

"Say, then we want to get after him at once!" cried the detective.

"I agree on that," answered Dick. He turned to the chauffeur. "Do you
know the dock from which the Princess Lenida sails?" he questioned.

"Sure I do! I've been there many a time," answered the taxicab driver.

"Then take us there just as quickly as you can," said Dick. "Never
mind the speed laws. If you are held up we will pay the fine."

"We won't be held up-- not if I show this," said the detective, and
exhibited the badge pinned to his vest. Then Dick and Mr. Bronson
jumped into the taxicab, and away the turnout went at top speed back
to the heart of the city.

"How did you get here?" questioned Tom, of the detective while riding
along.

"As I said I would, I got into communication with one of our men out
West, and he went after that Barton Pelter. He got him in Dayton, and
made him confess that he had sent that note to you. Then he told our
man that his uncle was most likely here in Philadelphia; so I came on
at once to see if I could locate the man."

"If only we can catch him before he sails!" cried Sam.

"Oh, we've got to do it!" put in Tom.

Soon the taxicab reached the crowded thoroughfares of Philadelphia.
They made several turns, crossing the track of the street cars, and
finally came to a halt near the river front.

"There's the dock you want," said the chauffeur, pointing with his
hand.

"Is that the Princess Lenida?" questioned Dick, quickly, indicating
the upper works of a steamer, which could be seen over the dock
buildings.

"I think so, sir."

"Come on, then!" cried Tom. "Sam, you pay the fellow, will you?"

"All right!" was the quick reply. And then Tom and Dick hurried after
Mr. Bronson, who was already entering the dock building.

Had they been alone the Rovers might have had some difficulty in
gaining entrance to the dock; but the detective led the way, showing
his badge; and soon the party found themselves at the gang-plank of
the steamer. Here Sam rejoined them.

From the purser they learned that Jesse Pelter had engaged stateroom
Number 148.

"But I can't say if he is aboard or not," said the steamer official.
"You see, we are not to sail until nine o'clock to-morrow morning.
There was some talk of sailing this afternoon, but we have been
delayed. Do you want me to send to the stateroom for you?"

"Oh, no, we'll go there ourselves," returned the detective, quickly.
"I don't want to alarm him if I can help it."

"I guess you are after him," said the purser, grimly.

"We certainly are!" answered Tom.

It was an easy matter to locate stateroom Number 148, which was on the
main deck forward. The entrance was in a narrow passageway, and close
at hand was a door opening on a narrow walkway between the staterooms
and the ship's rail.

"Wait a moment," whispered the detective, and stepped outside. He was
now close to a shuttered window of the stateroom engaged by Jesse
Pelter.

From the room came a murmur of voices, and without speaking further
the detective motioned for the Rover boys to join him beside the
window. Although the slatted shutter was up, evidently the glass of
the window had been let down its full length, for those outside could
hear what was said within with ease.

"That proposition is all right as far as it goes," they heard, in
Jesse Pelter's voice. "But I can't see, Haywood, where you ought to
have fifty per cent. of the returns."

"I do!" answered somebody else-- evidently the man called Haywood.
"I'm running all the risk, it seems to me."

"Not so very much of a risk," went on Jesse Pelter. "Sixty thousand
dollars' worth of those bonds are unregistered."

"All very true. But for all you know the numbers may be advertised as
stolen. If so, I may get pinched when I offer them."

"Not if you are careful and work the thing in the right kind of a
way," pursued the former broker.

"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do," returned Haywood. "I'll take a
third and not a dollar less. Now let us go over the bonds and check
them up," he continued. And then followed a rustling of numerous
papers.

"Don't you think we have heard enough?" whispered Dick, to the
detective.

"All that is necessary, Mr. Rover," was the answer. "Stand close by
me," the detective continued, "and be prepared to rush them the
instant the door is opened."

Having thus spoken, Mr. Bronson stepped back through the passageway,
and knocked sharply on the stateroom door.

"Who's there?" came in nervous tones from Jesse Pelter.

"A telegram for Mr. Pelter!" cried the detective, in a high-pitched,
boyish voice.

"Oh!" came from within; and then the key was turned in the lock, and
the door was opened several inches.

The next instant the detective threw his weight against the barrier,
and forced it back. He leaped into the stateroom, and the three Rover
boys followed him.

"Hi, what does this mean?" cried Jesse Pelter, as he was forced
backward against a washstand.

"It means that your game is up, Pelter!" cried Tom.

"We've caught you just as we wanted to!" added Dick.

"And you're not going to get away either," came from Sam, as he
managed to close the stateroom door and put his back against it.

Mr. Bronson had said nothing. He held the former broker with one hand,
and produced a pair of handcuffs with the other. Then came a double
click, and Jesse Pelter found himself handcuffed.

"See here, you let me out of this!" stormed the man named Haywood. "I
haven't done anything wrong. You let me go!" And he started for the
door.

"Not much! You stay where you are!" cried Tom, and gave the fellow a
shove which sent him sprawling backward over a berth.

In the meanwhile Dick's quick eyes had located the japanned box partly
filled with the missing bonds. Other bonds lay on the berth and on the
floor. The oldest Rover boy lost no time in gathering up the precious
documents, and placed them in the box.

"I tell you I want you to let me go!" spluttered Haywood. "I haven't
done anything wrong!"

"See here, Grimes," broke in the detective, sternly, "you sit right
where you are. I know you, and you ought to know me;" and the
detective took a step forward and looked the man full in the face.

"Oliver Bronson!" murmured the man who had agreed to dispose of the
stolen bonds. "How did you get onto this game?"

"You'll find out about that later, Grimes."

"Is his name Grimes?" questioned Tom.

"That's one of his names. He is also known as Haywood, and likewise
Slippery Peter. He used to work in Pittsburgh and Washington; but I
heard some time ago that he was trying his games on in Philadelphia."

"See here, Rover, can't we-- er-- fix this little matter up somehow?"
faltered Jesse Pelter.

"We can, and we will-- in court," answered Dick, coldly.

"Oh, but see here----"

"Don't waste your breath, Pelter. We let you go on those other
charges, but we are not going to let you go on this one," interrupted
Dick. "This was a downright steal, and you have got to take the
consequences. Mr. Bronson, what do you want to do with them?"

"One of you had better call in a policeman," returned the detective.
"Then we'll take them to headquarters. I think this is quite a catch,"
he continued. "The authorities have been trying to fasten something on
Grimes for a long while."

"Humph! You haven't fastened this on me yet," growled the sharper
mentioned.

"Don't worry. You'll get what's coming to you," returned the
detective.

Sam slipped out, and in a few minutes returned with a policeman. Then
a call was sent in for a patrol wagon, and in this the entire party
was taken to the police station. A formal charge was entered against
the two criminals, and they were led away to separate cells. Then came
several formalities before Dick and his brothers were allowed to take
possession of the japanned box with its precious contents. The bonds
were gone over with care, and it was ascertained that not one was
missing.

"Oh, this is great!" cried Tom, his face beaming. "I feel like dancing
a jig."

"So do I," returned Sam. "Dick, don't you think we had better send
word to New York?"

"Oh, we'll take the next train back, Sam, and surprise the girls,"
answered the oldest brother.

"I'll remain behind in Philadelphia, and take charge of this case,"
said Mr. Bronson. "Now that you have your bonds back, I suppose you'll
want to fix up some of those financial matters that you mentioned."

"We certainly do," answered Dick.

And after a few words more, the boys bade the detective good-bye, and
hurried to take a train back to the metropolis.

  CHAPTER XXX

 MRS. TOM ROVER-- CONCLUSION

"And you got back all the bonds, Dick? How, splendid!"

It was Dora who uttered the words, shortly after the arrival at the
Outlook Hotel of the three Rovers. Dick had had the japanned box under
his arm, and now held it up in triumph.

"Yes, we've got them all back, and those that don't go to the bank as
collateral security for a loan are going to a safe deposit box,"
answered Dick. "I won't take any more chances with an office safe."

"Especially not that office safe," put in Sam, pointedly.

"And what are you going to do with Jesse Pelter?" questioned Nellie.

"We are going to put him where he belongs-- in prison," answered Tom.
And it may be as well to state here that in due course of time Jesse
Pelter and his partner in crime, Grimes, alias Haywood, were tried and
sentenced to long terms in prison. At this trial it was brought to
light that Barton Pelter had known about the hole in the back of the
safe, but had had absolutely nothing to do with the taking of the
bonds. Jesse Pelter was very bitter against his nephew for exposing
him, but the Rovers told the young man that he had done exactly right,
and he said that he thought so, too. As soon as the trial was over
Barton Pelter returned to the Middle West, where he did fairly well as
a traveling salesman for the cracker company.

The next few days following the recovery of the bonds proved busy ones
for the Rovers. Some of the bonds were put up at a bank as collateral
security for a substantial loan, and with this money Dick took care of
the Sharon Valley Land Company investment, and also the investment
brought to his attention by Mr. Powell.

"Now we are on the straight road once more!" declared Dick, after
these matters and a number of others had been cleared up.

"And I'm mighty glad of it," returned Tom, with a beaming face. "I
think we all ought to go off and celebrate. What's the matter with a
trip to Coney Island, or something like that?"

"Wow! I thought he was going to suggest a honeymoon trip for himself
and Nellie," cried Sam, mischievously.

"Say, young man, don't get so previous!" retorted Tom, growing red in
the face. "Just the same, that's coming a little later," he added,
quickly.

"Provided Nellie is willing," went on the youngest Rover, teasingly.

"Oh, don't you worry about that, Sam. By the looks of things you'll be
in the same boat some day."

"Well, a fellow might do worse," answered Sam, coolly.

The days to follow were full of combined business and pleasure for the
boys. When they were not at the office they were with the girls, and
all took numerous trips to various places of amusement in and out of
the metropolis. As was to be expected, Tom was the life of the party,
and the way he "cut up" was "simply awful," as Nellie declared.

"Well, I can't help it," was the way the fun-loving Rover explained
his actions. "I've got to let off steam or 'bust,'" and then he did a
few steps of a jig, finishing by catching Nellie up in his arms and
whirling her around in the air.

Of course the boys had lost no time in sending word to the folks at
Valley Brook Farm that all business complications had been
straightened out, and that everything at the offices was running
smoothly. In return came back word that Mr. Anderson Rover was feeling
stronger than ever, and hoped ere long to be well enough to visit the
city.

  "But I don't expect to do much in business," wrote Mr. Rover. "I am
  going to leave that entirely to Dick and Tom. I understand that Tom
  expects before a great while to get married, and when that happens
  I want to form The Rover Company, and take him and Dick in with me,
  Sam, of course, to come in later, after he has finished at college,
  although he won't have to take an active part unless he wishes to
  do so. My best love to all of you, and may you have no more
  trouble."

"Dear old dad!" murmured Tom, when he had perused this communication,
and for a moment his voice grew husky and his eyes moist.

Now that it had been definitely settled that Tom and Nellie were going
to be married, Sam wanted to know if the date couldn't be set early
enough so that he could be on hand before returning to Brill. This
bolstered up Tom's plea for an early ceremony, and it was decided that
the wedding should come off the first week in September.

Then followed great preparations on the part of Nellie and the others.
Mrs. Laning and Mrs. Stanhope came down to New York, and numerous
shopping tours were instituted, in which the boys had no part. Then
the Lanings and Mrs. Stanhope returned to Cedarville, and Tom and Sam
went back to the farm.

During those days, as busy as they were, Nellie and Tom had not
forgotten Andy Royce. Letters had been exchanged between the young
folks and those in authority at Hope Seminary, and at last it was
arranged that the gardener should be taken back and given another
chance. He promised faithfully to give up drinking.

The Rover boys had also had several visits from Josiah Crabtree. They
had found out that the former teacher of Putnam Hall was practically
down and out, and, although he was not deserving of their sympathy,
all felt sorry for him, and so not only did they give him the fifty
dollars as Dick had promised, but they also presented him with a new
outfit of clothing. Then Josiah Crabtree departed, to accept the
position as a teacher which had been offered to him.

"Where are you going to live after you are married, Tom?" questioned
Sam. "Are you going to the Outlook Hotel, too?"

"Not much, no hotel life for me!" returned Tom. "Nellie and I talked
it over with Dora and Dick, and we have taken an apartment together on
Riverside Drive, a pretty spot overlooking the Hudson River. We are
going to keep house together, and we'll all be 'as snug as a bug in a
rug.'"

"Oh, that will be fine!"

"Some day, Sam, I suppose we'll be taking in you and Grace," went on
Tom, with a grin. "Well, we'll do it even if we have to get a larger
apartment."

It had been decided that the wedding should take place in the
Cedarville Union Church-- a little stone edifice where Dick and Dora
had been married, and which for years had been the church home of the
Lanings and the Stanhopes. Nellie and Tom had a host of friends, and
it was a question how so many could be accommodated in such a small
building.

"Well, if they can't get in, they'll have to stand outside," said Tom,
when talking the matter over. "We'll do the best we can." And then the
invitations to the affair were addressed and sent out.

As was to be expected, the wedding presents were both numerous and
costly, rivalling those received by Dora and Dick. Mr. Anderson Rover
duplicated the silver service given to his oldest son, and Dick and
Sam joined in forwarding a handsomely decorated dinner set. As Uncle
Randolph and Aunt Martha had given Dick a set of encyclopedias, they
sent other books to Nellie, but not forgetting a specially-bound
volume of the uncle's book on scientific farming. In addition to all
this came a bankbook from Mr. Anderson Rover with an amount written
therein that was the duplicate of the amount he had presented to Dora
and Dick.

"I knew he'd do it, Nellie," said Tom, when, with their heads close
together, the pair looked at the bankbook. "It's just like dad."

"It's too perfectly splendid for anything, Tom!" returned the girl,
her eyes beaming. "When I get the chance I'm just going to hug him to
death!"

Nellie and Grace had always been Mrs. Stanhope's favorite nieces, and
now that lady sent a set of beautifully embroidered linen, some of
which had been in the Stanhope family for several generations. And to
this gift Mr. and Mrs. Laning added some cut glass dishes of the
latest design. Then came from Captain Putnam of the school which the
boys had attended so many years, a revolving bookstand, and with it a
box of books, each volume from some particular youth who in the past
had been a cadet at Putnam Hall-- twenty-four volumes in all, each
with a name in it that brought up all sorts of memories to Tom as he
read it.

"One of the nicest gifts the Old Guard could have given me!" was Tom's
comment. "It must have been some job to get that set of books
together. Why, some of those fellows are miles and miles away! They
are scattered all over the United States."

Many of the students at Hope had remembered Nellie, and even Miss
Harrow sent her a small water-color picture. From the boys of Brill
came half a dozen presents-- some useful and some ornamental. Even
Tom's former enemy, Dan Baxter, who was now his friend, had not
forgotten him, and sent a pair of napkin rings, suitably engraved.
Tom's own present to his bride was a magnificent diamond brooch, which
pleased Nellie immensely.

And then came the great day, full of sunshine and with a gentle breeze
blowing from the West. Tom and his family, including his father, who
now felt almost as strong as ever, were located at the old Stanhope
home with a number of their friends, while many of Nellie's relatives
and friends were stopping with the Lanings at their farm. Other
friends of both the young folks were located at the Cedarville Hotel.

To follow the time set by Dick and Dora, it had been decided to hold
the wedding at high noon. As before, the church was decorated with
palms brought up from Ithaca. Soon the guests began to assemble, until
the little edifice was crowded to its capacity. Captain Putnam was
there in full uniform, and with him over a score of cadets. From Brill
came at least a dozen collegians led by Spud and Stanley. Even
William, Philander Tubbs was on hand, in a full-dress suit of the
latest pattern, and with a big chrysanthemum in his buttonhole. There
were several bridesmaids led by Grace, while Sam was Tom's best man.
The wedding party was preceded by, a little flower girl, and a little
boy beside her who carried the wedding rings on a pillow.

Nellie was on her father's arm, daintily attired in white charmeuse
with her tulle veil trimmed in orange blossoms, and her girl friends
declared that she was the prettiest bride they had ever seen. The
ceremony was a short one, and at the conclusion Tom gave his bride
such a hearty smack that every one present had to smile.

"A fine wedding, don't you know!" was William Philander Tubbs'
comment, when a number of the guests were on their way to the Laning
home, in carriages and automobiles.

"Yes. And Tom has got a fine girl!" answered Songbird.

"Where's the poetry for the occasion, Songbird?" queried Stanley.

"Oh, I am reserving that for the wedding dinner," was the answer. And
it may be mentioned here that at the proper time the would-be poet
recited an original poem of half a dozen verses, written in honor of
the occasion.

"Say, Dick, we've got to give Tom a send-off," whispered Sam to his
big brother, after the Laning home had been reached.

"We sure will give him a send-off!" returned Dick, who had not
forgotten what had taken place when he and Dora had departed on their
honeymoon.

"I wish I didn't have to go back to Brill," went on the youngest
Rover, rather wistfully, and with a sigh.

"Oh, your term at college will soon come to an end, Sam. You may have
lots of fun." What fun Sam did have, and what further befell the boys
will be related in the next volume of this series, to be entitled "The
Rover Boys on a Tour; Or, Last Days at Brill College."

"His bed is empty there, M'sieu'," she said, impressively, and
pointing.

"I suppose I should trust you in this matter; I suppose you should
know.

But, Dauphin--what does Dauphin say?"

The saddler laughed outright. Maximilian Cour suddenly blushed
in sympathy with Madame Dauphin, who now saw the drift of the
Seigneur's remarks, and was sensibly agitated, as the Seigneur had
meant her to be.
Had she not turned Dauphin's human sympathies into a crime?"They are going to slip away if they can," was Sam's comment to half a
dozen of his chums, a little later. "We'll have to be on our guard."

All of the young folks had provided themselves with rice, confetti,
old shoes, and strips of white ribbon with which to celebrate the
occasion-- the ribbon being for the purpose of decorating the young
couple's baggage. Sam had also provided a placard which read: "Are we
happy? We are!" and this was nailed to Tom's trunk.

"Where are they?"

This was the cry that went up in the middle of one of the dances. Tom
had slipped off into a side room, and Nellie had followed. Now both of
the young folks were missing.

"They are going out the back way!" cried Dick.

"Everybody watch the stairs and the doors!" exclaimed Sam. "We mustn't
let them get away from us!"

There was a general scramble, commingled with shrieks of laughter as
the young folks did their best to locate the missing couple. Then of a
sudden came a wild toot from an automobile horn.

"There they are!"

"Come on, everybody!"

There followed a wild scramble from the house to the lane leading to
the roadway. In the lane was an automobile belonging to the Cedarville
garage, and run by a chauffeur. On the back seat were Tom and Nellie,
waving their hands gaily.

"Good-bye, everybody! Sorry we have to leave you so soon!" yelled Tom.

"We'll be back some day! Good-bye!" added Nellie.

"After them! After them!" yelled Dick and Sam; and then all of the
young folks hurried up the lane, pelting those in the automobile with
rice and old shoes.

"We might go after them in another auto," suggested Spud.

"You'll never catch that machine," returned one of the Putnam Hall
cadets. "That's the fastest car around Cedarville. Tom knew what he
was doing when he hired it."

The automobile with the newly-married pair had already reached the
highway. "Jo," said Charley Steele, "do you honestly think there's
a river like that?"
'M'sieu', I know it. I saw Ignace Latoile, who robbed a priest and
got drunk on the communion wine--I saw him with the devil in the
Black Canoe at the Saguenay.

I could see Ignace; I could see the devil; I could see the Kimash River.
I shall ride myself some day.

"Ride where?"
"What does it matter where?" 
"Why should you ride?"
"Because you ride fast with the devil."
"What is the good of riding fast?"I do hope
they get along in life!"

"Come on back and finish the dance," said Sam to Grace. And then
catching her arm tightly, he whispered: "It is our turn next, isn't
it?"

"Maybe, Sam," she returned, in a low voice Already the band was
striking up, and soon the young folks had resumed their dancing; and
here for the time being we will leave them, and say good-bye.

 THE END
