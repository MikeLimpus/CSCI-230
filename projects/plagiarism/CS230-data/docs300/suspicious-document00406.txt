   XIX.  At this time he carried sketch-books in which he jotted everything--all
manner of drawings and outlines of nature and architecture, notes
of local gossip, chemical memoranda, notes of expenses, tavern
bills, views of coasts and cities, ruins, castles, manufacturing
works, and detached figures.

One book gives views about the Simplon Pass, another the sea-coast
from Nice to Genoa, another contains countless jottings from the
pictures in the Vatican, another is taken up with views in Paris
and Rouen, and several are devoted to Scottish scenery.

In 1806 Turner began his _Liber Studiorum_, in rivalship of Claude's
_Liber Veritatis_; it was issued in parts in dark blue covers, each
part containing five plates.

It was discontinued in 1814, after seventy plates had been issued. Although
not remunerative at the time, in later days as high as three thousand
pounds has been paid for a single copy of the _Liber_, while the subscription
price was only seventeen pounds ten shillings; even before Turner died
a copy of it was worth over thirty guineas. Charles Turner, the engraver,
used the proofs for kindling-paper; but some years later Colnaghi, the
print dealer, paid him fifteen hundred pounds for his remaining
"rubbish," as he considered it.

"Good God!" cried the old engraver; "I have been burning bank-notes all
my life!" In 1878 Professor Norton, of Harvard University, published
a set of thirty-three of the best of the _Liber_ studies, reproduced in
Boston by the heliotype process. The _Liber Studiorum_ was intended
to manifest Turner's command of the whole compass of the landscape art,
and was divided into six heads:
historical, pastoral, elegant pastoral, mountain, marine, and
architectural.

In 1808 Turner was appointed Professor of Perspective in the Royal
Academy. During two or three years only, out of the thirty in which
he held the professorship, did he deliver lectures. He spoke in a deep
and mumbling voice, was confused and tedious in manner, and
frequently became hopelessly entangled in blind mazes of obscure
words.

Sometimes when he had written out his lectures he was unable to
read them.

Once, after fumbling in his pockets, he exclaimed: "Gentlemen, I've been
and left my lecture in the hackney-coach." Still he was interested in
this work, and Ruskin says: "The zealous care with which Turner
endeavored to do his duty is proved by a large existing series of
drawings, exquisitely tinted, and often completely colored, all by
his own hand, of the most difficult perspective subjects--illustrating
not only directions of light, but effects of light, with a care and
completion which would put the work of any ordinary teacher to utter
shame."

During this year he took a house at Hammersmith, Upper Mall, the garden of
which ran down to the Thames, but still retained his residence in Harley
Street. In 1812 he first occupied the house No. 47 Queen Anne Street,
and this house he retained for forty years.

It was dull, dingy, unpainted, weather-beaten, sooty, with unwashed
windows and shaky doors, and seemed the very abode of poverty, and
yet when Turner died his estate was sworn as under one hundred and
forty thousand pounds--seven hundred thousand dollars.

When Turner's father died in 1830 he was succeeded by a withered and
sluttish old woman named Danby.
The whole house was dreary, dirty, damp, and full of litter. The master
had a fancy for tailless--Manx--cats, and these made their beds everywhere
without disturbance. In the gallery were thirty thousand fine proofs
of engravings piled up and rotting. His studio had a fair north light from
two windows, and was surrounded by water-color drawings. His sherry-bottle
was kept in an old second-hand buffet.

About 1813 or 1814 Turner purchased a place at Twickenham; he rebuilt the
house, and called it Solus Lodge. The rooms were small, and contained
models of rigged ships which he used in his marine views; in his
jungle-like garden he grew aquatic plants which he often copied in
foregrounds.

He kept a boat for fishing and marine sketching; also a gig and an old
cropped-eared horse, with which he made sketching excursions.
He made at this time the acquaintance of Rev.

Mr. Trimmer, the rector of the church at Heston, who was a lover of art,
and often took journeys with Turner. While visiting at the rectory Turner
regularly attended church in proper form; and finally he wrote a note
to Mr. Trimmer, alluding to his affection for one of the rector's
kinswomen, and suggesting: "If Miss ---- would but waive bashfulness,
or in other words make an offer instead of expecting one, the same [Lodge]
might change occupiers." But Turner was doomed to disappointment, and
never made another attempt at matrimony. In 1814 Turner commenced his
contributions of drawings to illustrate "Cook's Southern Coast,"
and continued this congenial work for twelve years, making forty
drawings at the rate of about twenty guineas each; the drawings
were returned to the artist after being engraved.

In 1815 he exhibited the "Dido Building Carthage," and in 1817 a
companion picture, the "Decline of the Carthaginian Empire," and for these
two pictures the artist refused five thousand pounds, having secretly
willed them to the National Gallery.

Ruskin divides Turner's art life into three periods: that of study,
from 1800 to 1820; that of working out art theories toward an ideal,
from 1820 to 1835; and that of recording his own impressions of
nature, from 1835 to 1845, preceded by a period of development, and
followed by a period of decline, from 1845 to 1850.

Besides his pictures painted on private commission, Turner exhibited two
hundred and seventy-five pictures at the Academy.

The "Rivers of England" was published in 1824, with sixteen engravings
after Turner; another series contained six illustrations of the "Ports of
England"--second-class cities. In 1826 the "Provincial Antiquities
of Scotland" was published, with thirteen illustrations by Turner.

The same year he sold his house at Twickenham, because, he said, "Dad"
was always working in the garden, and catching abominable colds. In
1827 Turner commenced the "England and Wales" on his own account, and
continued it for eleven years. It consisted of a hundred plates,
illustrating ports, castles, abbeys, cathedrals, palaces, coast views, and
lakes. In 1828 Turner went to Rome by way of Nismes, Avignon, Marseilles,
Nice, and Genoa; and this year painted his "Ulysses Dividing
Polyphemus," of which Thornbury says: "For color, for life and
shade, for composition, this seems to me to be the most wonderful
and admirable of Turner's realisms."

Ruskin calls it his central picture, illustrating his perfect power.

Of Turner's wonderful versatility, Ruskin says: "There is architecture,
including a large number of formal 'gentlemen's seats;' then lowland
pastoral scenery of every kind, including nearly all farming
operations, plowing, harrowing, hedging and ditching, felling trees,
sheep-washing, and I know not what else; there are all kinds of
town life, court-yards of inns, starting of mail coaches, interiors
of shops, house-buildings, fairs, and elections; then all kinds of
inner domestic life, interiors of rooms, studies of costumes, of
still-life and heraldry, including multitudes of symbolical vignettes;
then marine scenery of every kind, full of local incident--every
kind of boat, and the methods of fishing for particular fish being
specifically drawn--round the whole coast of England; pilchard-fishing
at St.

Ives, whiting-fishing at Margate, herring at Loch Fyne, and all kinds
of shipping, including studies of every separate part of the
vessels, and many marine battle-pieces; then all kinds of mountain
scenery, some idealized into compositions, others of definite
localities, together with classical compositions; Romes and Carthages,
and such others by the myriad, with mythological, historical, or
allegorical figures; nymphs, monsters, and spectres, heroes and
divinities....

Throughout the whole period with which we are at present concerned,
Turner appears as a man of sympathy absolutely infinite--a sympathy so
all-embracing that I know nothing but that of Shakespeare comparable
with it. A soldier's wife resting by the roadside is not beneath
it; Rizpah watching the dead bodies of her sons, not above it.
Nothing can possibly be so mean as that it will not interest his
whole mind and carry his whole heart; nothing so great or solemn but
that he can raise himself into harmony with it; and it is impossible
to prophesy of him at any moment whether the next he will be in
laughter or tears."

In 1832 Turner made a will in which he bequeathed the bulk of his
estate for the founding of an institution "for the Maintenance and
Support of Poor and Decayed Male Artists being born in England and of
English parents only, and of lawful issue." It was to be called "Turner's
Gift," and for the next twenty years the artist pinched, and economized
to increase the fund for his noble purpose.

At this time he was entering upon his third manner--that of his highest
excellence, when he "went to the cataract for its iris, and the conflagration
for its flames; asked of the sky its intensest azure, of the sun
its clearest gold."

It is remarked by Ruskin, who has made most profound study of Turner's
works, that he had an underlying meaning or moral in his groups of foreign
pictures; in Carthage, he illustrated the danger of the pursuit of
wealth; in Rome, the fate of unbridled ambition; and in Venice, the
vanity of pleasure and luxury. The Venetian pictures began in 1833,
with a painting of the Doge's Palace, Dogana, Campanile, and Bridge
of Sighs; and with these were exhibited "Van Tromp Returning from
Battle," the "Rotterdam Ferry-boat," and the "Mouth of the Seine."

In 1830 or 1831 he made, on commission from the publisher Cadell,
twenty-four sketches to illustrate Walter Scott's poems--published in
1834--and while doing this he was entertained royally at Abbotsford,
and made excursions with Scott and Lockhart to Dryburgh Abbey and other
points of interest. He went as far north as the Isle of Skye, where he
drew Loch Corriskin, and nearly lost his life by a fall.
About this time he made a series of illustrations for Scott's "Life
of Napoleon."

Turner spent some time in Edinburgh, frequently sketching with Thomson,
a clergyman and local artist, who was preferred by some of the Scotch
amateurs to Turner.

He one day called at Thomson's house to examine his paintings, but instead
of expected praises he merely remarked, "You beat me in frames." Turner
made thirty-three illustrations for Rogers's "Poems" (Fig. 75),
and seventeen for an extended edition of Byron.

He was in the habit at this time of frequently walking to Cowley Hall, the
residence of a Mr. Rose, where he was kindly welcomed.

He was there called "Old Pogey." One day Mrs. Rose asked him to paint her
favorite spaniel; in amazement he cried, "My dear madam, you do
not know what you ask;" and always after this the lady went by the
title of "My dear madam."

Mr. Rose tells how he and Turner sat up one night until two o'clock drinking
cognac and water, and talking of their travels.

When Mrs. Rose and a lady, a friend, visited Turner in a house in Harley
Street, in mid-winter, they were entertained with wine and biscuits
in a cold room, without a fire, where they saw seven tailless
cats, which Turner said were brought from the Isle of Man.

For three years Turner travelled in France, and made studies and
sketches up and down its rivers. These were first published as "Turner's
Annual Tour," but were afterward brought out by Bohn as "Liber Fluviorum."
These sketches have been highly praised by Ruskin; but Hammerton,
who certainly knows French scenery far more accurately than Ruskin, while
praising the exquisite beauty of Turner's work, challenges its accuracy,
and especially as to color, saying that "Turner, as a colorist, was
splendid and powerful, but utterly unfaithful." Leitch Ritchie, who was
associated with Turner in this work, could not travel with him, their
tastes were so unlike; and he says that Turner's drawings were
marvellously exaggerated, that he would make a splendid picture of
a place without a single correct detail, trebling the height of
spires and throwing in imaginary accessories.

Turner always claimed the right to change the groupings of his landscapes
and architecture at will, preferring to give a general and idealized
view of the landscape rather than a precise copy thereof.

In 1835 he exhibited "Heidelberg Castle in the Olden Time," "Ehrenbreitstein,"
"Venice from the Salute Church," and "Line-fishing off Hastings." In
1836 he exhibited a "View of Rome from the Aventine Hill," and the
"Burning of the House of Lords and Commons," which last was almost
entirely painted on the walls of the exhibition.

At this time it was the custom to have what were called "varnishing
days" at the exhibition, during which time artists retouched, and
finished up their pictures.

They were periods of fun and practical jokes, and Turner always enjoyed,
and made the most of them. He frequently sent his canvas to the Academy
merely sketched out and grounded, and then coming in as early as
four in the morning on varnishing days, he would put his nose to
the sketch and work steadily with thousands of imperceptible touches
until nightfall, while his picture would begin to glow as by magic.

About this time he exhibited many pictures founded on classical subjects,
or with the scenes laid in Italy or Greece, as "Apollo and Daphne
in the Vale of Tempe," "Regulus Leaving Rome to Return to Carthage,"
the "Parting of Hero and Leander," "Phryne Going to the Public
Baths as Venus," the "Banishment of Ovid from Rome, with Views of
the Bridge and Castle of St.

Angelo." A year later he exhibited pictures of "Ancient Rome," a vast
dreamy pile of palaces, and "Modern Rome," with a view of the "Forum
in Ruins."
One of the most celebrated of Turner's pictures was that of the "Old
Téméraire," an old and famous line-of-battle ship, which in the battle
of Trafalgar ran in between and captured the French frigates Redoubtable
and Fougueux. Turner saw the Téméraire in the Thames after she had
become old, and was condemned to be dismantled. The scene is laid at
sunset, when the smouldering, red light is vividly reflected on the
river, and contrasts with the quiet, gray and pearly tints about the
low-hung moon.
The majestic old ship looms up through these changing lights, bathed in
splendor. The artist refused a large price for this picture by Mr.
Lennox, of New York, and finally bequeathed it to the nation. In 1840
Turner exhibited the "Bacchus and Ariadne," two marine scenes, and two
views in Venice; also the well-known "Slavers Throwing Overboard the
Dead and Dying, a Typhoon Coming On" (Fig. 76), which is now in the Museum
of Fine Arts of Boston. Of this picture Thackeray says: "I don't know
whether it is sublime or ridiculous."

But Ruskin, in "Modern Painters," says: "I believe if I were reduced
to test Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose the
'Slave Ship.' Its daring conception, ideal in the highest sense of the
word, is based on the purest truth, and wrought out with the concentrated
knowledge of a life. Its color is absolutely perfect, not one false or
morbid hue in any part or line, and so modulated that every square inch
of canvas is a perfect composition; its drawing as accurate as
fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of motion; its tones as
true as they are wonderful; and the whole picture dedicated to the most
sublime of subjects and impressions (completing thus the perfect system
of all truth which we have shown to be formed by Turner's works), the
power, majesty, and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable sea."

[Illustration: FIG. 76.--THE SLAVE SHIP. _By Turner._]
No painter of modern times, or perhaps of any time, has ever provoked the
discussion of his merits which Turner did. When he was at his best his
great merits and his originality procured for him the strongest defenders,
and finally brought his pictures into favor with the wealthy middle
class of England, so that he obtained high prices, and since his death
these prices have doubled, and even quadrupled.

At a sale of Mr. Bicknell's collection in 1836, ten of Turner's pictures,
which had been bought for three thousand seven hundred and forty-nine
pounds, were sold for seventeen thousand and ninety-four pounds. As
Turner grew older and his manner deteriorated he was assailed by the wits,
the art critics, and the amateurs with cruel badinage, and to these
censures Turner was morbidly sensitive. But even Ruskin admits that
the pictures of his last five years are of "wholly inferior value," with
unsatisfactory foliage, chalky faces, and general indications of feebleness
of hand.

Wornum, in his _Epochs of Painting_, said: "In the last ten years of his
career, and occasionally before, Turner was extravagant to an
extreme degree; he played equally with nature and with his colors.

Light, with all its prismatic varieties, seems to have been the chief object
of his studies; individuality of form or color he was wholly indifferent
to.

The looseness of execution in his latest works has not even the
apology of having been attempted on scientific principles; he did not
work upon a particular point of a picture as a focus and leave the rest
obscure, as a foil to enhance it, on a principle of unity; on the contrary,
all is equally obscure and wild alike. These last productions are a
calamity to his reputation; yet we may, perhaps, safely assert that
since Rembrandt there has been no painter of such originality and power
as Turner." Dr.

Waagen says in his _Treasury of Art in Great Britain_: "No landscape
painter has yet appeared with such versatility of talent.

His historical landscapes exhibit the most exquisite feeling for
beauty of hues and effect of lighting, at the same time that he has the
power of making them express the most varied moods of nature."

Toward the last part of his life Turner's peculiarities increased; he
became more morose, more jealous. He was always unwilling to have even
his most intimate friends visit his studio, but he finally withdrew from
his own house and home. Of late years he had frequently left his house
for months at a time, and secreted himself in some distant quarter,
taking care that he should not be followed or known. When the great
Exhibition of 1851 opened, Turner left orders with his housekeeper that
no one should be admitted to see his pictures. For twenty years the rain
had been streaming in upon them through the leaky roof,
and many were hopelessly ruined.

The half-breed pocketed the coins as the other buttoned his shirt and
took another long pull at the bottle.

"Wer' you goin' now?" he asked as the cowpuncher started for the door.
The man paused and regarded him critically.  "First off, I'm goin' to get
my horse.  An' then me an' you is goin' down to the depot an' you're
a-goin' to buy that there ticket.  I'm a-goin' to see that you get it
ironclad an' onredeemable, I ain't got no confidence in no gambler an'
bein' as I've took a sort of likin' to you, I hate to think of you
a-walkin' clean to Montana in them high-heeled boots.  After that I'm
a-goin' to start out an' examine this here town of Las Vegas lengthways,
crossways, down through the middle, an' both sides of the crick.  An'
when that's off my mind, I'm a-goin' to begin on the rest of the world."
He moved his arm comprehensively and reached for the bottle.

"You wait right here till I get old Ace of Spades," he continued solemnly
when he had rasped the raw liquor from his throat.  "If you ain't here
when I come back I'll swallow-fork your ears with this here gat just to
see if my shootin' eye is in practice.  The last time I done any fancy
shootin' I was kind of wild--kep' a-hittin' a little to one side an' the
other--not much, only about an inch or so--but it wasn't right good
shootin'."

The half-breed grinned: "A'm stay here till you com' back.  A'm fin' dat
you ma frien'.  A'm lak' you, _bien_!"

When the Texan returned, fifteen minutes later, the man of many names was
gone.  "It's just like I said, you can't trust no gambler," he muttered,
with a doleful nod of the head.  "He's pulled out on me, but he better
not infest the usual marts of midnight.  'Cause I'm a-goin' to start out
an' take in everything that's open in this man's town, an' if I find him
I'll just nachelly show him the onprincipledness of lyin' to a friend."

Stepping to the bar he bought a drink and a moment later swung onto the
big rangy black and clattered down the street.  At the edge of the town
he turned and started slowly back, dismounting wherever the lights of a
saloon illumined the dingy street, but never once catching a glimpse of
the figure that followed in the thick blackness of the shadows.  Before
the saloon of the surly proprietor the cowpuncher brought his big black
to a stand and sat contemplating the sorrel that stood dejectedly with
ears adroop and one hind foot resting lightly upon the toe.

"So that's the cayuse Fatty wanted to trade me for Ace of Spades!" he
snorted.  "That dog-legged, pot-gutted, lop-eared patch of red he offers
to trade to _me_ fer _Ace of Spades_!  It's a doggone insult!  I didn't
know it at the time, havin' only a couple of drinks, an' too sober to
judge a insult when I seen one.  But it's different now, I can see it in
the dark.  I'm a-goin' in there an'--an' twist his nose off an' feed it
to him.  But first I got to find old Bat.  He's an Injun, but he's a good
old scout, an' I hate to think of him walkin' all the way to Montana
while some damn Greaser is spendin' my hard earned samolians that I give
him for carfare.  It's a long walk to Montana.  Plumb through Colorado
an' Wyomin' an'--an' New Jersey, or somewheres.  Mebbe he's in there now.
As they say in the Bible, or somewheres, you got to hunt for a thing
where you find it, or something.  Hold still, there you black devil you!
What you want to stand there spinnin' 'round like a top for?  You be'n
drinkin', you doggone old ringtail!  What was I goin' to do, now.  Oh,
yes, twist Patty's nose, an' find Bat an' shoot at his ears a while, an'
make him get his ticket to New Jersey an'----

"This is a blame slow old town, she needs wakin' up, anyhow.  If I ride
in that door I'll get scraped off like mud off a boot."

He spurred the black and brought him up with a jerk beside the sorrel
which snorted and reared back, snapping the reins with which he had been
tied, and stood with distended nostrils sniffing inquiringly at Ace of
Spades as the cowpuncher swung to the ground.

"Woke up, didn't you, you old stager?  Y'ain't so bad lookin' when you're
alive.  Patty'll have to get him a new pair of bridle reins.  Mebbe the
whole town'll look better if it's woke up some.

"Y-e-e-e-e-o-w!  Cowboys a-comin'!"

A citizen or two paused on the street corner, a few Mexicans grinned as
they drew back to allow the Gringo free access to the saloon, and a
swarthy figure slipped unobserved across the street and blended into the
shadow of the adobe wall.

"O-o-o-o-o-h, the yaller r-o-s-e of Texas!" sang the cowpuncher, with
joyous vehemence.  As he stepped into the room, his eyes swept the faces
of the gamblers and again he burst into vociferous song:

"O-o-o-o-o-h, w-h-e-r-e is my wanderin' b-o-y tonight?"

"Hey, you!  Whad'ye think this is, a camp meetin'?"

The Texan faced the speaker.  "Well, if it ain't my old college chum!
Fatty, I stopped in a purpose to see you.  An' besides which, by the
unalien rights of the Constitution an' By-laws of this here United States
of Texas, a man's got a right to sing whatever song suits him
irregardless of sex or opportunity."  The other glared malevolently as
the cowpuncher approached the bar with a grin.  "Don't bite yourself an'
die of hydrophobia before your eggication is complete, which it ain't
till you've learnt never to insult no Texas man by offerin' to trade no
rat-tailed, ewe-necked old buzzard fodder fer a top Texas horse.

"Drop that mallet!  An' don't go reachin-' around in under that bar,
'cause if you find what you're huntin' fer you're a-goin' to see fer
yourself if every cloud's got a silver linin'.  'Tend to business now,
an' set out a bottle of your famous ol' Las Vegas stummick shellac an'
while I'm imbibin' of its umbilical ambrosier, I'll jest onscrew your
nose an' feed it to the cat."

Sweat stood out upon the forehead of the heavy-paunched proprietor as
with a flabby-faced grin he set out the bottle.  But the Texan caught the
snake-like flash of the eyes with which the man signalled to the croupier
across the room.  Gun in hand, he whirled:

"No, you don't, Toney!"  An ugly blue-black automatic dropped to the
floor and the croupier's hands flew ceilingward.

"I never seen such an outfit to be always a-reachin'," grinned the
cowpuncher.  "Well, if there ain't the ol' eagle-bird wheel!  Give her a
spin, Toney!  They say you can't hit an eagle on the fly with a six-gun,
but I'm willin' to try!  Spin her good, 'cause I don't want no onfair
advantage of that there noble bird.  Stand back, Greasers, so you don't
get nicked!"

As the croupier spun the wheel, three shots rang in an almost continuous
explosion and the gamblers fell over each other in an effort to dodge the
flying splinters that filled the powder-fogged air.

  "Little black bull slid down the mountain,
  L-o-n-g t-i-m-e ago!"

roared the Texan as he threw open the cylinder of his gun.

  "H-e-e-e-e scraped his horn on a hickory saplin',
  L-o-n-g t-i-m-e ago----"

There was a sudden commotion behind him, a swift rush of feet, a muffled
thud, and a gasping, agonized grunt.  The next instant the huge acetelyne
lamp that lighted the room fell to the floor with a crash and the place
was plunged in darkness.

"Queek, m's'u, dees way!" a hand grasped his wrist and the cowpuncher
felt himself drawn swiftly toward the door.  From all sides sounded the
scuffling of straining men who breathed heavily as they fought in the
blackness.

A thin red flame cut the air and a shot rang sharp.  Someone screamed and
a string of Spanish curses blended into the hubbub of turmoil.

"De hosses, queek, m's'u!"

The cool air of the street fanned the Texan's face as he leaped across
the sidewalk, and vaulted into the saddle.  The next moment the big black
was pounding the roadway neck and neck with another, smaller horse upon
which the half-breed swayed in the saddle with the ease and grace of the
loose-rein rider born.

It was broad daylight when the cowpuncher opened his eyes in an arroyo
deep among the hills far, far from Las Vegas.  He rubbed his forehead
tenderly, and crawling to a spring a few feet distant, buried his face in
the tiny pool and drank deeply of the refreshing liquid.  Very
deliberately he dried his face on a blue handkerchief, and fumbled in his
pockets for papers and tobacco.  As he blew the grey smoke from his
nostrils he watched the half-breed who sat nearby industriously splicing
a pair of broken bridle reins.

"Did you get that ticket, Bat?" he asked, with a hand pressed tightly
against his aching forehead.

The other grinned.  "Me, A'm no wan' no ticket.  A'm lak A'm stay wit'
you, an' mebbe-so we git de job togedder."

The cowpuncher smoked for a time in silence.

"What was the rookus last night?" he asked, indifferently.  Then,
suddenly, his eye fell upon the sorrel that snipped grass at the end of a
lariat rope near the picketed black, and he leaped to his feet.  "Where'd
you get that horse?" he exclaimed sharply.  "It's Fatty's!  There's the
reins he busted when he snorted loose!"

Again the half-breed grinned.  "A'm bor' dat hoss for com' 'long wit'
you.  Dat Fatty, she damn bad man.  She try for keel you w'en you tak' de
shot at de wheel.  A'm com' 'long dat time an' A'm keek heem in de guts
an' he roll 'roun' on de floor, an' A'm t'row de bottle of wheesky an'
smash de beeg lamp an' we com' 'long out of dere."  The cowpuncher tossed
his cigarette away and spat upon the ground.

"How'd you happen to come in there so handy just at the right time?" he
asked with a sidewise glance at the half-breed.

"Oh, A'm fol' you long tam'.  A'm t'ink mebbe-so you git l'il too mooch
hooch an' som'one try for do you oop.  A'm p'ek in de door an' seen Fatty
gon' shoot you.  Dat mak' me mad lak hell, an' A'm run oop an' keek heem
so hard I kin on hees belly.  You ma frien'.  A'm no lak I seen you git
keel."

The Texan nodded.  "I see.  You're a damn good Injun, Bat, an' I ain't
got no kick comin' onto the way you took charge of proceedin's.  But you
sure raised hell when you stole that horse.  They's prob'ly about
thirty-seven men an' a sheriff a-combin' these here hills fer us at this
partic'lar minute an' when they catch us----"

The half-breed laughed.  "Dem no ketch.  We com' feefty mile.  Dat leetle
hoss she damn good hoss.  We got de two bes' hoss.  We ke'p goin' dey no
ketch.  'Spose dey do ketch.  Me, A'm tell 'em A'm steal dat hoss an' you
not know nuthin' 'bout dat."

There was a twinkle in the Texan's eye as he yawned and stretched
prodigiously.  "An' I'll tell 'em you're the damnedest liar in the state
of Texas an' North America throw'd in.  Come on, now, you throw the
shells on them horses an' we'll be scratchin' gravel.  Fifty miles ain't
no hell of a ways--my throat's beginnin' to feel kind of draw'd already."

"W'er' we goin'?" asked the half-breed as they swung into the saddles.

"Bat," said the other, solemnly, "me an' you is goin' fast, an' we're
goin' a long time.  You mentioned somethin' about Montana bein'
considerable of a cow country.  Well, me an' you is a-goin' North--as far
North as cattle is--an' we're right now on our way!"


CHAPTER I

THE TRAIN STOPS

"I don't see why they had to build their old railroad down in the
bottom of this river bed."  With deft fingers Alice Marcum caught back
a wind-tossed whisp of hair.  "It's like travelling through a trough."

"Line of the least resistance," answered her companion as he rested an
arm upon the polished brass guard rail of the observation car.  "This
river bed, running east and west, saved them millions in bridges."

The girl's eyes sought the sky-line of the bench that rose on both
sides of the mile-wide valley through which the track of the great
transcontinental railroad wound like a yellow serpent.

"It's level up there.  Why couldn't they have built it along the edge?"

The man smiled: "And bridged all those ravines!" he pointed to gaps and
notches in the level sky-line where the mouths of creek beds and
coulees flashed glimpses of far mountains.  "Each one of those ravines
would have meant a trestle and trestles run into big money."

"And so they built the railroad down here in this ditch where people
have to sit and swelter and look at their old shiny rails and scraggly
green bushes and dirt walls, while up there only a half a mile away the
great rolling plains stretch away to the mountains that seem so near
you could walk to them in an hour."

"But, my dear girl, it would not be practical.  Railroads are built
primarily with an eye to dividends and--"  The girl interrupted him
with a gesture of impatience.

"I hate things that are practical--hate even the word.  There is
nothing in all the world so deadly as practicability.  It is ruthless
and ugly.  It disregards art and beauty and all the higher things that
make life worth living.  It is a monster whose god is dollars--and who
serves that god well.  What does any tourist know of the real West--the
West that lies beyond those level rims of dirt?  How much do you or I
know of it?  The West to us is a thin row of scrub bushes along a
narrow, shallow river, with a few little white-painted towns sprinkled
along, that for all we can see might be in Illinois or Ohio.  I've been
away a whole winter and for all the West I've seen I might as well have
stayed in Brooklyn."

"But certainly you enjoyed California!"

"California!  Yes, as California.  But California isn't the _West_!
California is New York with a few orange groves thrown in.  It is a
tourist's paradise.  A combination of New York and Palm Beach.  The
real West lies east of the Rockies, the uncommercialized,
unexploited--I suppose you would add, the unpractical West.  A New
Yorker gets as good an idea of the West when he travels by train to
California as a Californian would get of New York were he to arrive by
way of the tube and spend the winter in the Fritz-Waldmore."

"I rather liked California, what little I saw of it.  A business trip
does not afford an ideal opportunity for sight seeing."

"You like Newport and Palm Beach, too."

The man ignored the interruption.

"But, at least, this trip has combined a good bit of business with a
very big bit of pleasure.  It is two years since I have seen you
and----"

"And so you're going to tell me for the twenty-sixth time in three days
that you still love me, and that you want me to marry you, and I'll
have to say 'no' again, and explain that I'm not ready to marry
anybody."  She regarded him with an air of mock solemnity.  "But really
Mr. Winthrop Adams Endicott I think you _have_ improved since you
struck out for yourself into the wilds of--where was it, Ohio, or some
place."

"Cincinnati," answered the man a trifle stiffly.  The girl shuddered.
"I had to change cars there once."  Again she eyed him critically.
"Yes, two years have made a really noticeable improvement.  Do the
Cincinnati newspapers always remember to use your whole name or do they
dare to refer to Winthrop A. Endicott.  If I were a reporter I really
believe I'd try it once.  If you keep on improving, some day somebody
is going to call you Win."

The man flushed: "Are you never serious?" he asked.

"Never more so than this minute."

"You say you are not ready to many.  You expect to marry, then,
sometime?"

"I don't _expect_ to.  I'm _going_ to."

"Will you marry me when you are ready?"

The girl laughed.  "Yes, if I can't find the man I want, I think I
shall.  But he must be somewhere," she continued, after a pause during
which her eyes centred upon the point where the two gleaming rails
vanished into the distance.  "He must be impractical, and human,
and--and _elemental_.  I'd rather be smashed to pieces in the Grand
Canyon, than live for ever on the Erie Canal!"

"Aren't you rather unconventional in your tastes----?"

"If I'm not, I'm a total failure!  I hate conventionality!  And lines
of least resistance!  And practical things!  It is the _men_ who are
the real sticklers for convention.  The same kind of men that follow
the lines of least resistance and build their railroads along
them--because it is practical!

"I don't see why you want to marry me!" she burst out resentfully.
"I'm not conventional, nor practical.  And I'm not a line of least
resistance!"

"But I love you.  I have always loved you, and----"

The girl interrupted him with a quick little laugh, which held no trace
of resentment.  "Yes, yes, I know.  I believe you do.  And I'm glad
because really, Winthrop, you're a dear.  There are lots of things
about you I admire.  Your teeth, and eyes, and the way you wear your
clothes.  If you weren't so terribly conventional, so cut and dried,
and matter of fact, and _safe_, I might fall really and truly in love
with you.  But--Oh, I don't know!  Here I am, twenty-three.  And I
suppose I'm a little fool and have never grown up.  I like to read
stories about knights errant, and burglars, and fair ladies, and
pirates, and mysterious dark oriental-looking men.  And I like to go to
places where everybody don't go--only Dad won't let me and----  Why
just think!" she exclaimed in sudden wrath, "I've been in California
for three months and I've ridden over the same trails everybody else
has ridden over, and motored over the same roads and climbed the same
mountains, and bathed at the same beach, and I've met everybody I ever
knew in New York, just as I would have met them in Newport or Palm
Beach or in Paris or Venice or Naples for that matter!"

"But why go off the beaten track where everything is arranged for your
convenience?  These people are experienced travellers.  They know that
by keeping to the conventional routes-----"

"Winthrop Adams Endicott, if you say that word again I'll shriek!  Or
I'll go in from this platform and not speak to you again--ever!  You
know very well that there isn't a traveller among them.  They're just
tourists--professional goers.  They do the same things, and say the
same things, and if they could think, they'd think the same things
every place they go.  And I don't want things arranged for my
convenience--so there!"

Winthrop Adams Endicott lighted a cigarette, brushed some white dust
from his sleeve, and smiled.

"If I were a man and loved a girl so very, very much I wouldn't just
sit around and grin.  I'd do something!"

"But, my dear Alice, what would you have me do?  I'm not a knight
errant, nor a burglar, nor a pirate, nor a dark mysterious
oriental--I'm just a plain ordinary business man and----"

"Well, I'd do something--even if it was something awful like getting
drunk or shooting somebody.  Why, if you even had a past you wouldn't
be so hopeless.  I could love a man with a past.  It would show at
least, that he hadn't followed the line of the least resistance.  The
world is full of canals--but there are only a few canyons.  Look!  I
believe we're stopping!  Oh, I hope it's a hold-up!  What will you do
if it is?"  The train slowed to a standstill and Winthrop Adams
Endicott leaned out and gazed along the line of the coaches.

"There is a little town here.  Seems to be some commotion up
ahead--quite a crowd.  If I can get this blamed gate open we can go up
and see what the trouble is."

"And if you can't get it open you can climb over and lift me down.  I'm
just dying to know what's the matter.  And if you dare to say it
wouldn't be conventional I'll--I'll jump!"


CHAPTER II

WOLF RIVER

A uniformed flagman, with his flag and a handful of torpedoes swung
from the platform and started up the track.

"What's the trouble up in front?" asked the girl as Endicott assisted
her to the ground.

"Cloud busted back in the mountains, an' washed out the trussle, an'
Second Seventy-six piled up in the river."

"Oh, a wreck?" she exclaimed.  "Will we have time to go up and see it?"

"I'd say it's a wreck," grinned the trainman.  "An' you've got all the
time you want.  We're a-goin' to pull in on the sidin' an' let the
wrecker an' bridge crew at it.  But even with 'em a-workin' from both
ends it'll be tomorrow sometime 'fore they c'n get them box cars drug
out an' a temp'ry trussle throw'd acrost."

"What town is this?"

"Town!  Call it a town if you want to.  It's Wolf River.  It's a
shippin' point fer cattle, but it hain't no more a town 'n what the
crick's a river.  The trussle that washed out crosses the crick just
above where it empties into Milk River.  I've railroaded through here
goin' on three years an' I never seen no water in it to speak of
before, an' mostly it's plumb dry."

The man sauntered slowly up the track as one who performs a merely
nominal duty, and the girl turned to follow Endicott.  "It would have
been easier to walk through the train," he ventured, as he picked his
way over the rough track ballast.

"Still seeking the line of least resistance," mocked the girl.  "We can
walk through a train any time.  But we can't breathe air like this,
and, see,--through that gap--the blue of the distant mountains!"

The man removed his hat and dabbed at his forehead with a handkerchief.
"It's awfully hot, and I have managed to secrete a considerable portion
of the railroad company's gravel in my shoes."

"Don't mind a little thing like that," retorted the girl sweetly.
"I've peeled the toes of both of mine.  They look like they had scarlet
fever."

Passengers were alighting all along the train and hurrying forward to
join those who crowded the scene of the wreck.

"It was a narrow escape for us," said Endicott as the two looked down
upon the mass of broken cars about which the rapidly falling waters of
the stream gurgled and swirled.  "Had we not been running an hour late
this train would in all probability, have plunged through the trestle."

"Was anybody hurt?" asked the girl.  The train conductor nodded toward
the heap of debris.

"No'm, the crew jumped.  The fireman an' head brakeman broke a leg
apiece, an' the rest got bunged up a little; but they wasn't no one
hurt.

"I was just tellin' these folks," he continued, "that they'll be a
train along on the other side in a couple of hours for to transfer the
passengers an' mail."

The girl turned to Endicott.  "There isn't much to see here," she said.
"Let's look around.  It's such a funny little town.  I want to buy
something at the store.  And, there's a livery stable!  Maybe we can
hire horses and ride out where we can get a view of the mountains."

As the two turned toward the little cluster of frame buildings, a tall,
horse-faced man clambered onto the pilot of the passenger locomotive
and, removing his hat, proceeded to harangue the crowd.  As they paused
to listen Alice stared in fascination at the enormous Adam's apple that
worked, piston-like above the neckband of the collarless shirt of vivid
checks.

"Ladies an' gents," he began, with a comprehensive wave of the
soft-brimmed hat.  "Wolf River welcomes you in our town.  An' while
you're amongst us we aim to show you one an' all a good time.  This
here desastorious wreck may turn out to be a blessin' in disguise.  As
the Good Book says, it come at a most provincial time.  Wolf River,
ladies an' gents, is celebratin', this afternoon an' evenin', a event
that marks an' epykak in our historious career: The openin' of the Wolf
River Citizen's Bank, a reg'lar bonyfido bank with vaults, cashier, an'
a board of directors consistin' of her leadinist citizens, with the
Honorable Mayor Maloney president, which I introdoose myself as.

"In concludin' I repeet that this here is ondoubtfully the luckiest
wreck in the lives of any one of you, which it gives you a
unpressagented chanct to see with your own eyes a hustlin' Western town
that hain't ashamed to stand on her own legs an' lead the world along
the trail to prosperity.

"Wolf River hain't a braggin' town, ladies an' gents, but I defy any
one of you to name another town that's got more adjacent an' contigitus
territory over which to grow onto.  We freely admit they's a few
onconsequential improvements which is possessed by some bigger an' more
notorious cities such as sidewalks, sewers, street-gradin', an' lights
that we hain't got yet.  But Wolf River is a day an' night town, ladies
an' gents, combinin' business with pleasure in just the right
perportion, which it's plain to anyone that takes the trouble to
investigate our shippin' corrals, four general stores, one _ho_tel, an'
seven saloons, all of which runs wide open twenty-four hours a day an'
is accommodated with faro, roulette, an' poker outfits fer the benefit
of them that's so inclined to back their judgment with a little money.

"In concloodin' I'll say that owin' to the openin' of the bank about
which I was tellin' you of, Wolf River is holdin' the followin'
programme which it's free to everyone to enter into or to look on at.

"They'll be a ropin' contest, in which some of our most notorious
ropers will rope, throw, an' hog-tie a steer, in the least shortness of
time.  The prizes fer this here contest is: First prize, ten dollars,
doneated by the directors of the bank fer which's openin' this
celebration is held in honour of.  Second prize, one pair of pants
doneated by the Montana Mercantile Company.  Third prize, one quart of
bottle in bond whiskey doneated by our pop'lar townsman an' leadin'
citizen, Mr. Jake Grimshaw, proprietor of The Long Horn Saloon.

"The next contest is a buckin' contest, in which some of our most
notorious riders will ride or get bucked offen some of our most fameous
outlaw horses.  The prizes fer this here contest is: First, a pair of
angory chaps, doneated by the directors of the bank about which I have
spoke of before.  Second prize, a pair of spurs doneated by the Wolf
River Tradin' Company.  Third prize, a coffin that was ordered by Sam
Long's wife from the Valley Outfittin' Company, when Sam had the
apendiceetis of the stummick, an' fer which Sam refused to pay fer when
he got well contrary to expectations.

"Both these here contests is open to ladies an' gents, both of which is
invited to enter.  They will also be hoss racin', fancy an' trick
ridin', an' shootin', fer all of which sootable prizes has be'n
pervided, as well as fer the best lookin' man an' the homliest lady an'
vicy versy.  Any lady or gent attendin' these here contests will be
gave out a ticket good fer one drink at any saloon in town.  These
drinks is on the directors of the bank of which I have before referred
to.

"An', ladies an' gents, in concloodin' I'll say that that hain't all!
Follerin' these here contests, after each an' every lady an' gent has
had time to git their drink they'll be a supper dished out at the
_ho_otel fer which the directors of the bank of which you have already
heard mention of has put up fifty cents a plate.  This here supper is
as free as gratis to all who care to percipitate an' which will
incloode a speech by the Honorable Mayor Maloney, part of which I have
already spoke, but will repeat fer the benefit of them that hain't here.

"Followin' the supper a dance will be pulled off in Curly Hardee's
dance-hall, the music fer which will be furnished by some of our most
notorious fiddlers incloodin' Mrs. Slim Maloney, wife of the Honorable
Mayor Maloney, who will lead the grand march, an' who I consider one of
the top pyanoists of Choteau County, if not in the hull United States.
It is a personal fact ladies an' gents, that I've heard her set down to
a pyano an' play _Old Black Joe_ so natural you'd swear it was _Home
Sweet Home_.  An' when she gits het up to it, I'll promise she'll
loosen up an' tear off some of the liveliest music any one of you's
ever shook a leg to.

"An' now, ladies an' gents, you can transfer an' go on when the train
pulls in on t'other side, or yon can stay an' enjoy yourselves amongst
us Wolf River folks an' go on tomorrow when the trussle gits fixed----"

"Ye-e-e-e-o-o-w!  W-h-e-e-e-e."

Bang, bang, bang!  Bang, bang, bang!  A chorus of wild yells, a
fusillade of shots, and the thud of horses' hoofs close at hand drew
all eyes toward the group of riders that, spreading fan-like over the
flat that lay between the town and the railway, approached at top speed.

"The cowboys is comin'!  Them's the Circle J," cried the Mayor.
"Things'll lively up a bit when the T U an' the I X an' the Bear Paw
Pool boys gits in."  The cowboys were close, now, and the laughing,
cheering passengers surged back as the horses swerved at full speed
with the stirrups of their riders almost brushing the outermost rank of
the crowd.  A long thin rope shot out, a loop settled gently about the
shoulders of the Mayor of Wolf River, and a cowhorse stopped so
abruptly that a cloud of alkali dust spurted up and settled in a grey
powder over the clothing of the assembled passengers.

"Come on, Slim, an' give these folks a chance to get their second wind
while you let a little licker into that system of yours."

The Mayor grinned; "Tex Benton, hain't you had no bringin' up whatever?
That was a pretty throw but it's onrespectable, no mor'n what it's
respectable to call the Mayor of a place by his first name to a public
meetin'."

"I plumb ferget myself, your Honour," laughed the cowpuncher as he
coiled his rope.  "Fact is, I learnt to rope mares back in Texas, an' I
ain't----"

"Yip-e-i-e!"

"Ropin' mares!"  The cowboys broke into a coyote chorus that drowned
the laughter of the crowd.

"The drinks is on me!" sputtered the Mayor, when he was able to make
himself heard.  "Jest you boys high-tail over to the Long Horn an' I'll
be along d'rectly."  He turned once more to the crowd of passengers.

"Come on, gents, an' have a drink on me.  An' the ladies is welcome,
too.  Wolf River is broad in her idees.  We hain't got no sexual
restrictions, an' a lady's got as good a right to front a bar an'
nominate her licker as what a man has."

Standing beside Endicott upon the edge of the crowd Alice Marcum had
enjoyed herself hugely.  The little wooden town with its high fenced
cattle corrals, and its row of one story buildings that faced the
alkali flat had interested her from the first, and she had joined with
hearty goodwill in the rounds of applause that at frequent intervals
had interrupted the speech of the little town's Mayor.  A born
horsewoman, she had watched with breathless admiration the onrush of
the loose-rein riders--the graceful swaying of their bodies, and the
flapping of soft hat brims, as their horses approached with a thunder
of pounding hoofs.  Her eyes had sparkled at the reckless swerving of
the horses when it seemed that the next moment the back-surging crowd
would be trampled into the ground.  She had wondered at the precision
with which the Texan's loop fell; and had joined heartily in the
laughter that greeted the ludicrous and red-faced indignation with
which a fat woman had crawled from beneath a coach whither she had
sought refuge from the onrush of thundering hoofs.

In the mind of the girl, cowboys had always been associated with motion
picture theatres, where concourses of circus riders in impossible
regalia performed impossible feats of horsemanship in the unravelling
of impossible plots.  She had never thought of them as real--or, if she
had, it was as a vanished race, like the Aztec and the buffalo.

But here were real cowboys in the flesh: Open-throated, bronzed man,
free and unrestrained as the air they breathed--men whose very
appearance called to mind boundless open spaces, purple sage, blue
mountains, and herds of bellowing cattle.  Here were men bound by no
petty and meaningless conventions--men the very sight of whom served to
stimulate and intensify the longing to see for herself the land beyond
the valley rims--to slip into a saddle and ride, and ride, and ride--to
feel the beat of the rain against her face, and the whip of the wind,
and the burning rays of the sun, and at night to lie under the winking
stars and listen to the howl of the coyotes.

"Disgusting rowdies!" wheezed the fat woman as, dishevelled and
perspiring, she waddled toward the steps of her coach; while the Mayor,
his Adam's apple fairly pumping importance, led a sturdy band of
thirsters recruited from among the train passengers across the flat
toward a building over the door of which was fixed a pair of horns of
prodigious spread.  Lest some pilgrim of erring judgment should mistake
the horns for short ones, or misapprehend the nature of the business
conducted within, the white false front of the building proclaimed in
letters of black a foot high: LONG HORN SALOON.  While beneath the
legend was depicted a fat, vermilion clad cowboy mounted upon a
tarantula-bodied, ass-eared horse of pink, in the act of hurling a
cable-like rope which by some prodigy of dexterity was made to describe
three double-bows and a latigo knot before its loop managed to poise in
mid-air above the head of a rabbit-sized baby-blue steer whose horns
exceeded in length the pair of Texas monstrosities that graced the
doorway.

"We're goin' to back onto the sidin' now," announced the conductor,
"where dinner will be served in the dinin' car as ushool."

The cowboys had moved along to view the wreck and were grouped about
the broken end of the trestle where they lolled in their saddles, some
with a leg thrown carelessly about the horn and others lying back over
the cantle, while the horses which a few moments before had dashed
across the common at top speed now stood with lowered heads and
drooping ears, dreaming cayuse dreams.

The engine bell was ringing monotonously and the whistle sounded three
short blasts, while the passengers clambered up the steps of the
coaches or backed away from the track.

"Let's walk to the side track, it's only a little way."

Alice pointed to where the flagman stood beside the open switch.
Endicott nodded acquiescence and as he turned to follow, the girl's
handkerchief dropped from her hand and, before it touched the ground,
was caught by a gust of wind that swept beneath the coaches and whirled
out onto the flat where it lay, a tiny square of white against the
trampled buffalo grass.

Endicott started to retrieve it, but before he had taken a half-dozen
steps there was a swift pounding of hoofs and two horses shot out from
the group of cowboys and dashed at full speed, their riders low in the
saddle and each with his gaze fixed on the tiny bit of white fabric.
Nose and nose the horses ran, their hoofs raising a cloud of white
alkali dust in their wake.  Suddenly, just as they reached the
handkerchief, the girl who watched with breathless interest gasped.
The saddles were empty!  From the madly racing horses her glance flew
to the cloud of dust which concealed the spot where a moment before had
lain that little patch of white.  Her fingers clenched as she steeled
herself to the sight of the two limp, twisted forms that the lifting
dust cloud must reveal.  Scarcely daring to wink she fixed her eyes
upon the ground--but the dust cloud had drifted away and there were no
limp, twisted forms.  Even the little square of white was gone.  In
bewilderment she heard cries of approval and loud shouts of applause
from the passengers.  Once more her ears caught the sound of pounding
hoofs, and circling toward her in a wide curve were the two riders,
erect and firm in their saddles, as a gauntleted hand held high a
fluttering scrap of white.

The horses brought up directly before her, a Stetson was swept from a
thick shock of curly black hair, the gauntleted hand extended the
recalcitrant handkerchief, and she found herself blushing furiously for
no reason at all beneath the direct gaze of a pair of very black eyes
that looked out from a face tanned to the colour of old mahogany.

"Oh, thank you!  It was splendid--the horsemanship."  She stammered.
"I've seen it in the movies, but I didn't know it was actually done in
real life."

"Yes, mom, it is.  It's owin' to the horse yeh've got, an' yer cinch.
Yeh'll see a heap better'n that this afternoon right on this here flat.
An' would yeh be layin' over fer the dance tonight, mom?"

The abrupt question was even more disconcerting than the compelling
directness of his gaze.

For an instant, the girl hesitated as her eyes swept from the
cowpuncher's face to the brilliant scarf loosely knotted about his
throat, the blue flannel shirt, the bright yellow angora chaps against
which the ivory butt of a revolver showed a splotch of white, and the
boots jammed into the broad wooden stirrups, to their high heels from
which protruded a pair of enormously rowelled spurs inlaid with silver.
By her side Endicott moved impatiently and cleared his throat.

She answered without hesitation.  "Yes, I think I shall."

"I'd admire fer a dance with yeh, then," persisted the cowpuncher.

"Why--certainly.  That is, if I really decide to stay."

"We'll try fer to show yeh a good time, mom.  They'll be some right
lively fiddlin', an' she don't bust up till daylight."

With a smile the girl glanced toward the other rider who sat with an
air of tolerant amusement.  She recognized him as the man called
Tex--the one who had so deftly dropped his loop over the shoulders of
the Mayor, and noted that, in comparison with the other, he presented
rather a sorry appearance.  The heels of his boots were slightly run
over.  His spurs were of dingy steel and his leather chaps, laced up
the sides with rawhide thongs looked as though they had seen much
service.  The scarf at his throat, however, was as vivid as his
companion's and something in the flash of the grey eyes that looked
into hers from beneath the broad brim of the Stetson caused an
inexplicable feeling of discomfort.  Their gaze held a suspicion of
veiled mockery, and the clean cut lips twisted at their comers into the
semblance of a cynical, smiling sneer.

"I want to thank you, too," she smiled, "it wasn't your fault your
friend----"

"Jack Purdy's my name, mom," interrupted the other, importantly.

"--that Mr. Purdy beat you, I am sure.  And are you always as accurate
as when you lassoed the honourable Mayor of Wolf River?"

"I always get what I go after--sometimes," answered the man meeting her
gaze with a flash of the baffling grey eyes.  A subtle something, in
look or words, seemed a challenge.  Instinctively she realized that
despite his rough exterior here was a man infinitely less crude than
the other.  An ordinary cowpuncher, to all appearance, and
yet--something in the flash of the eyes, the downward curve of the
corners of the lips aroused the girl's interest.  He was speaking again:

"I'll dance with you, too--if you stay.  But I won't mortgage none of
your time in advance."  The man's glance shifted deliberately from the
girl to Endicott and back to the girl again.  Then, without waiting for
her to reply, he whirled his horse and swung off at top speed to join
the other cowpunchers who were racing in the wake of the Mayor.


CHAPTER III

PURDY

Some moments later, Jack Purdy nosed his horse into the group of
cayuses that stood with reins hanging, "tied to the ground," in front
of the Long Horn Saloon.  Beyond the open doors sounded a babel of
voices and he could see the men lined two deep before the bar.

Swinging from the saddle he threw the stirrup over the seat and became
immediately absorbed in the readjustment of his latigo strap.  Close
beside him Tex Benton's horse dozed with drooping head.  Swiftly a hand
whose palm concealed an open jack-knife slipped beneath the Texan's
right stirrup-leather and a moment later was withdrawn as the cayuse,
suspicious of the fumbling on the wrong side of the saddle, snorted
nervously and sheered sharply against another horse which with an angry
squeal, a laying back of the ears, and a vicious snap of the teeth,
resented the intrusion.  Purdy jerked sharply at the reins of his own
horse which caused that animal to rear back and pull away.

"Whoa, there!  Yeh imp of hell!" he rasped, in tones loud enough to
account for the commotion among the horses, and slipping the knife into
his pocket, entered the saloon from which he emerged unobserved while
the boisterous crowd was refilling its glasses at the solicitation of a
white goods drummer who had been among the first to accept the
invitation of the Mayor.

Three doors up the street he entered a rival saloon where the bartender
was idly arranging his glasses on the back-bar in anticipation of the
inevitable rush of business which would descend upon him when the
spirit should move the crowd in the Long Horn to start "going the
rounds."

"Hello, Cinnabar!"  The cowpuncher leaned an elbow on the bar, elevated
a foot to the rail, and producing tobacco and a book of brown papers,
proceeded to roll a cigarette.  The bartender returned the greeting and
shot the other a keen glance from the corner of his eye as he set out a
bottle and a couple of glasses.

"Be'n down to the wreck?" he asked, with professional
disinterestedness.  The cowpuncher nodded, lighted his cigarette, and
picking the bottle up by the neck, poured a few drops into his glass.
"Pretty bad pile-up," persisted the bartender as he measured out his
own drink.  "Two or three of the train crew got busted up pretty bad.
They say----

"Aw, choke off!  What the hell do I care what they say?  Nor how bad
the train crew got busted up, nor how bad they didn't?"  Purdy tapped
the bar with his glass as his black eyes fixed the other with a level
stare.  "I came over fer a little talk with yeh, private.  I'm a-goin'
to win that buckin' contest--an' yer goin' to help me--_sabe_?"

The bartender shook his head: "I don't know how I c'n help you none."

"Well yeh will know when I git through--same as Doc Godkins'll know
when I have a little talk with him.  Yer both a-goin' to help, you an'
Doc.  Yeh see, they was a nester's gal died, a year back, over on
Beaver Crick, an' Doc tended her.  'Tarford fever,' says Doc.  But ol'
Lazy Y Freeman paid the freight, an' he thinks about as much of the
nesters as what he does of a rattlesnake.  I was ridin' fer the Lazy Y
outfit, an' fer quite a spell 'fore this tarford fever business the ol'
man use to ride the barb wire along Beaver, reg'lar.  Yeh know how
loose ol' Lazy Y is with his change?  A dollar don't loom no bigger to
him than the side of Sugar Loaf Butte, an' it slips through his fingers
as easy as a porkypine could back out of a gunnysack.  Well, that there
dose of tarford fever that the nester gal died of cost ol' Lazy Y jest
a even thousan' bucks.  An' Doc Godkins got it."

The cowpuncher paused and the bartender picked up his glass.  "Drink
up," he said, "an' have another.  I do'no what yer talkin' about but
it's jest as bad to not have enough red licker in under yer belt when
y' go to make a ride as 'tis to have too much."

"Never yeh mind about the licker.  I c'n reg'late my own drinks to suit
me.  Mebbe I got more'n a ride a-comin' to me 'fore tonight's over."

The bartender eyed him questioningly: "You usta win 'em all--buckin',
an' ropin', an'----"

"Yes, I usta!" sneered the other.  "An' I could now if it wasn't fer
that Texas son of a ----!  Fer three years hand runnin' he's drug down
everything he's went into.  He c'n out-rope me an' out-ride me, but he
can't out-guess me!  An' some day he's goin' to have to out-shoot me.
I'm goin' to win the buckin' contest, an' the ropin', too.  See?"  The
man's fist pounded the bar.

The bartender nodded; "Well, here's _to_ you."

Once more Purdy fixed the man with his black-eyed stare.  "Yes.  But
they's a heap more a-comin' from you than a 'here's _to_ yeh.'"

"Meanin'?" asked the other, as he mechanically swabbed the bar.

"Meanin' that you an' Doc's goin' to help me do it.  An' that hain't
all.  Tonight 'long 'bout dance time I want that saddle horse o' yourn
an' yer sideways saddle, too.  They's a gal o' mine come in on the
train, which she'll be wantin', mebbe, to take a ride, an' hain't
fetched no split-up clothes fer to straddle a real saddle.  That
sideways contraption you sent fer 'fore yer gal got to ridin' man-ways
is the only one in Wolf River, an' likewise hern's the only horse
that'll stand fer bein' rigged up in it."

"Sure.  You're welcome to the horse an' saddle, Jack.  The outfit's in
the livery barn.  Jest tell Ross to have him saddled agin' you want
him.  He's gentled down so's a woman c'n handle him all right."

"Uh, huh.  An' how about the other?  Y'goin' to do as I say 'bout that,
too?"

The bartender opened a box behind him and selected a cigar which he
lighted with extreme deliberation.  "I told you onct I don't know what
yer talkin' about.  Lazy Y Freeman an' Doc Godkins's dirty work ain't
none of my business.  If you win, you win, an' that's all there is to
it."

The cowpuncher laughed shortly, and his black eyes narrowed, as he
leaned closer.  "Oh, that's all, is it?  Well, Mr. Cinnabar Joe, let me
tell yeh that hain't all--by a damn sight!"  He paused, but the other
never took his eyes from his face.  "Do yeh know what chloral is?"  The
man's voice lowered to a whisper and the words seemed to hiss from
between his lips.  The other shook his head.  "Well, it's somethin' yeh
slip into a man's licker that puts him to sleep."

"You mean drug?  Dope!"  The bartender's eyes narrowed and the corner
of his mouth whitened where it gripped the cigar.

Purdy nodded: "Yes.  It don't hurt no one, only it puts 'em to sleep
fer mebbe it's three er four hours.  I'll get some from Doc an' yer
goin' to slip a little into Tex Benton's booze.  Then he jest nach'lly
dozes off an' the boys thinks he's spliflicated an' takes him down to
the hotel an' puts him to bed, an' before he wakes up I'll have the
buckin' contest, an' the ropin' contest, an' most of the rest of it in
my war-bag.  I hain't afraid of none of the rest of the boys hornin' in
on the money--an' 'tain't the money I want neither; I want to win them
contests particular--an' I'm a-goin' to."

Without removing his elbows from the bar, Cinnabar Joe nodded toward
the door: "You git to hell out o' here!" he said, quietly.  "I don't
set in no game with you, see?  I don't want none o' your chips.  Of all
the God-damned low-lived----"

"If I was you," broke in the cowpuncher with a meaning look, "I'd choke
off 'fore I'd got in too fer to back out."  Something in the glint of
the black eyes caused the bartender to pause.  Purdy laughed, tossed
the butt of his cigarette to the floor, and began irrelevantly: "It's
hell--jest hell with the knots an' bark left on--that Nevada wild horse
range is."  The cowpuncher noted that Cinnabar Joe ceased suddenly to
puff his cigar.  "It's about seven year, mebbe it's eight," he
continued, "that an outfit got the idee that mebbe Pete Barnum had the
wild horse business to hisself long enough.  Four of 'em was pretty
rough hands, an' the Kid was headed that way.

"Them that was there knows a heap more'n what I do about what they went
through 'fore they got out o' the desert where water-holes was about as
common as good Injuns.  Anyways, this outfit didn't git no wild horses.
They was good an' damn glad to git out with what horses they'd took in,
an' a whole hide.  They'd blow'd in all they had on their projec' an'
they was broke when they headed fer Idaho."  The bartender's cigar had
gone out and the cowpuncher saw that his face was a shade paler.  "Then
a train stopped sudden one evenin' where they wasn't no station, an'
after that the outfit busted up.  But they wasn't broke no more, all
but the Kid.  They left him shift fer hisself.  Couple o' years later
two of the outfit drifted together in Cinnabar an' there they found the
Kid drivin' a dude-wagon.  Drivin' a dude-wagon through the park is a
damn sight easier than huntin' wild horses, an' a damn sight safer than
railroadin' with a Colt, so when the two hard hands stops the Kid's
dude-wagon in the park, thinkin' they'd have a cinch goin' through the
Kid's passengers, they got fooled good an' proper when the Kid pumps
'em full of .45 pills.  After that the Kid come to be know'd as
Cinnabar Joe, an' when the last of the dude-wagons was throw'd out fer
automobiles the Kid drifted up into the cow country.  But they's a
certain express company that's still huntin' fer the gang--not knowin'
o' course that the Cinnabar Joe that got notorious fer defendin' his
dudes was one of 'em.'"

The cowpuncher ceased speaking and produced his "makings" while the
other stood gazing straight before him, the dead cigar still gripped in
the corner of his mouth.  The scratch of the match roused him and quick
as a flash he reached beneath the bar and the next instant had Purdy
covered with a six-shooter.  With his finger on the trigger Cinnabar
Joe hesitated, and in that instant he learned that the man that faced
him across the bar was as brave as he was unscrupulous.  The fingers
that twisted the little cylinder of paper never faltered and the black
eyes looked straight into the muzzle of the gun.

Now, in the cow country the drawing of a gun is one and the same
movement with the firing of it, and why Cinnabar Joe hesitated he did
not know.

Purdy laughed: "Put her down, Cinnabar.  Yeh won't shoot, now.  Yeh
see, I kind of figgered yeh might be sort o' riled up, so I left my gun
in my slicker.  Shootin' a unarmed man don't git yeh nothin' but a
chanct to stretch a rope."

The bartender returned the gun to its place.  "Where'd you git that
dope, Jack?" he asked, in a dull voice.

"Well, seein' as yeh hain't so blood-thirsty no more, I'll tell yeh.  I
swung down into the bad lands couple weeks ago huntin' a bunch of mares
that strayed off the south slope.  I was follerin' down a mud-crack
that opens into Big Dry when all to onct my horse jumps sideways an'
like to got me.  The reason fer which was a feller layin' on the ground
where his horse had busted him agin' a rock.  His back was broke an' he
was mumblin'; which he must of laid there a day, mebbe two, cause his
tongue an' lips was dried up till I couldn't hardly make out what he
was sayin'.  I catched here an' there a word about holdin' up a train
an' he was mumblin' your name now an' agin so I fetched some water from
a hole a mile away an' camped.  He et a little bacon later but he was
half crazy with the pain in his back.  He'd yell when I walked near him
on the ground, said it jarred him, an' when I tried to move him a
little he fainted plumb away.  But he come to agin an' begged me fer to
hand him his Colt that had lit about ten feet away so he could finish
the job.  I seen they wasn't no use tryin' to git him nowheres.  He was
all in.  But his mutterin' had interested me consid'ble.  I figgers if
he's a hold-up, chances is he's got a nice fat _cache_ hid away
somewheres, an' seein' he hain't never goin' to need it I might's well
have the handlin' of it as let it rot where it's at.  I tells him so
an' agrees that if he tips off his _cache_ to me I'll retaliate by
givin' him the gun.  He swears he ain't got no _cache_.  He's blow'd
everything he had, his nerve's gone, an' he's headin' fer Wolf River
fer to gouge yeh out of some _dinero_.  He claims yeh collected reward
on them two yeh got in the Yellowstone an' what's more the dudes tuk up
a collection of a thousan' bucks an' give it to yeh besides.  _You_ was
his _cache_.  So he handed me the dope I just sprung on yeh, an' he
says besides that you an' him's the only ones left.  The other one got
his'n down in Mexico where he'd throw'd in with some Greaser bandits."

"An' what----  Did you give him the gun?" asked the bartender.

Purdy nodded: "Sure.  He' done a good job, too.  He was game, all
right, never whimpered nor hung back on the halter.  Jest stuck the gun
in his mouth an' pulled the trigger.  I was goin' to bury him but I
heard them mares whinner down to the water-hole so I left him fer the
buzzards an' the coyotes.

"About that there chloral.  I'll slip over an' git it from Doc.  An'
say, I'm doin' the right thing by yeh.  I could horn yeh fer a chunk o'
that reward money, but I won't do a friend that way.  An' more'n that,"
he paused and leaned closer.  "I'll let you in on somethin' worth while
one of these days.  That there thousan' that ol' Lazy Y paid Doc hain't
a patchin' to what he's goin' to fork over to me.  See?"

Cinnabar Joe nodded, slowly, as he mouthed his dead cigar, and when he
spoke it was more to himself than to Purdy.  "I've played a square game
ever since that time back on the edge of the desert.  I don't want to
have to do time fer that.  It wouldn't be a square deal nohow, I was
only a Kid then an' never got a cent of the money.  Then, there's
Jennie over to the hotel.  We'd about decided that bartendin' an'
hash-slingin' wasn't gittin' us nowheres an' we was goin' to hitch up
an' turn nesters on a little yak outfit I've bought over on Eagle."  He
stopped abruptly and looked the cowpuncher squarely in the eye.  "If it
wasn't fer her, by God! I'd tell you jest as I did before, to git to
hell out of here an' do your damnedest.  But it would bust her all up
if I had to do time fer a hold-up.  You've got me where you want me, I
guess.  But I don't want in on no dirty money from old Lazy Y, nor no
one else.  You go it alone--it's your kind of a job.

"This here chloride, or whatever you call it, you sure it won't kill a
man?"

Purdy laughed: "Course it won't.  It'll only put him to sleep till I've
had a chanct to win out.  I'll git the stuff from Doc an' find out how
much is a dost, an' you kin' slip it in his booze."

As the cowpuncher disappeared through the door, Cinnabar Joe's eyes
narrowed.  "You damn skunk!" he muttered, biting viciously upon the
stump of his cigar.  "If you was drinkin' anything I'd switch glasses
on _you_, an' then shoot it out with you when you come to.  From now on
it's you or me.  You've got your hooks into me an' this is only the
beginnin'."  The man stopped abruptly and stared for a long time at the
stove-pipe hole in the opposite wall.  Then, turning, he studied his
reflection in the mirror behind the bottles and glasses.  He tossed
away his cigar, straightened his necktie, and surveyed himself from a
new angle.

"This here Tex, now," he mused.  "He sure is a rantankerous cuss when
he's lickered up.  He'd jest as soon ride his horse through that door
as he would to walk through, an' he's always puttin' somethin' over on
someone.  But he's a man.  He'd go through hell an' high water fer a
friend.  He was the only one of the whole outfit had the guts to tend
Jimmy Trimble when he got the spotted fever--nursed him back to good as
ever, too, after the Doc had him billed through fer yonder."  Cinnabar
Joe turned and brought his fist down on the bar.  "I'll do it!" he
gritted.  "Purdy'll think Tex switched the drinks on me.  Only I hope
he wasn't lyin' about that there stuff.  Anyways, even if he was, it's
one of them things a man's got to do.  An' I'll rest a whole lot easier
in my six by two than what I would if I give Tex the long good-bye
first."  Unconsciously, the man began to croon the dismal wail of the
plains:


  "O bury me not on the lone praire-e-e
  In a narrow grave six foot by three,
  Where the buzzard waits and the wind blows free,
  Then bury me not on the lone praire-e-e.

  Yes, we buried him there on the lone praire-e-e
  Where the owl all night hoots mournfulle-e-e
  And the blizzard beats and the wind blows free
  O'er his lonely grave on the lone praire-e-e.

  And the cowboys now as they roam the plain"----


"Hey, choke off on that!" growled Purdy as he advanced with rattling
spurs.  "Puts me in mind of _him_--back there in Big Dry.  'Spose I ort
to buried him, but it don't make no difference, now."  He passed a
small phial across the bar.  "Fifteen or twenty drops," he said
laconically, and laughed.  "Nothin' like keepin' yer eyes an' ears
open.  Doc kicked like a steer first, but he seen I had his hide hung
on the fence onless he loosened up.  But he sure wouldn't weep none at
my demise.  If ever I git sick I'll have some other Doc.  I'd as soon
send fer a rattlesnake."  The man glanced at the clock.  "It's workin'
'long to'ards noon, I'll jest slip down to the Long Horn an' stampede
the bunch over here."


CHAPTER IV

CINNABAR JOE

In the dining car of the side-tracked train Alice Marcum's glance
strayed from the face of her table companion to the window.  Another
cavalcade of riders had swept into town and with a chorus of wild yells
the crowd in the Long Horn surged out to greet them.  A moment later
the dismounted ones rushed to their horses, leaped into the saddles
and, joined by the newcomers, dashed at top speed for perhaps thirty
yards and dismounted to crowd into another saloon across whose front
the word HEADQUARTERS was emblazoned in letters of flaming red.

"They're just like a lot of boys," exclaimed the girl with a smile,
"The idea of anybody mounting a horse to ride _that_ distance!"

"They're a rough lot, I guess."  Winthrop Adams Endicott studied his
menu card.

"Rough!  Of course they're rough!  Why shouldn't they be rough?  Think
of the work they do--rain or shine, riding out there on the plains.
When they get to town they've earned the right to play as they want to
play!  I'd be rough, too, if I lived the life they live.  And if I were
a man I'd be right over there with them this minute."

"Why be a man?" smiled Endicott.  "You have the Mayor's own word for
the breadth of Wolf River's ideas.  As for myself, I don't drink and
wouldn't enjoy that sort of thing.  Besides, if I were over there I
would have to forgo----"

"No pretty little speeches, _please_.  At least you can spare me that."

"But, Alice, I mean it, really.  And----"

"Save 'em for the Cincinnati girls.  They'll believe 'em.  Who do you
think will win this afternoon.  Let's bet!  I'll bet you a--an umbrella
against a pair of gloves, that my cavalier of the yellow fur trousers
will win the bucking contest, and----"

"Our train may pull out before the thing is over, and we would never
know who won."

"Oh, yes we will, because we're going to stay for the finish.  Why, I
wouldn't miss this afternoon's fun if forty trains pulled out!"

"I ought to be in Chicago day after tomorrow," objected the man.

"I ought to be, too.  But I'm not going to be.  For Heaven's sake,
Winthrop, for once in your life, do something you oughtn't to do!"

"All right," laughed the man with a gesture of surrender.  "And for the
rope throwing contest I'll pick the other."

"What other?"  The girl's eyes strayed past the little wooden buildings
of the town to the clean-cut rim of the bench.

"Why the other who rode after your handkerchief.  The fellow who
lassoed the honourable Mayor and was guilty of springing the pun."

The girl nodded with her eyes still on the skyline.  "Oh, yes.  He
seemed--somehow--different.  As if people amused him.  As if everything
were a joke and he were the only one who knew it was a joke.  I could
_hate_ a man like that.  The other, Mr. Purdy, hates him."

The man regarded her with an amused smile: "You keep a sort of mental
card index.  I should like to have just a peep at my card."

"Cards sometimes have to be rewritten--and sometimes it really isn't
worth while to fill them out again.  Come on, let's go.  People are
beginning to gather for the fun and I want a good seat.  There's a
lumber pile over there that'll be just the place, if we hurry."

In the Headquarters saloon Tex Benton leaned against the end of the bar
and listened to a Bear Paw Pool man relate how they took in a bunch of
pilgrims with a badger game down in Glasgow.  Little knots of
cowpunchers stood about drinking at the bar or discussing the coming
celebration.

"They've got a bunch of bad ones down in the corral," someone said.
"That ol' roman nose, an' the wall-eyed pinto, besides a lot of snorty
lookin' young broncs.  I tell yeh if Tex draws either one of them ol'
outlaws it hain't no cinch he'll grab off this ride.  The _hombre_ that
throws his kak on one of them is a-goin' to do a little sky-ballin'
'fore he hits the dirt, you bet.  But jest the same I'm here to bet ten
to eight on him before the drawin'."

Purdy who had joined the next group turned at the words.

"I'll jest take that," he snapped.  "Because Tex has drug down the last
two buckin' contests hain't no sign he c'n go south with 'em all."  At
the end of the bar Tex grinned as he saw Purdy produce a roll of bills.

"An', by gosh!" the Bear Paw Pool man was saying, "when they'd all got
their money down an' the bull dog was a-clawin' the floor to git at the
badger, an' the pilgrims was crowded around with their eyes a-bungin'
out of their heads, ol' Two Dot Wilson, he shoves the barrel over an'
they wasn't a doggone thing in under it but a----"

"What yeh goin' to have, youse?"  Purdy had caught sight of Tex who
stood between the Bear Paw Pool man and Bat Lajune.  "I'm bettin' agin'
yeh winnin' the buckin' contest, but I'll buy yeh a drink."

Tex grinned as his eyes travelled with slow insolence over the other's
outfit.

"You're sure got up some colourful, Jack," he drawled.  "If you sh'd
happen to crawl up into the middle of one of them real outlaws they got
down in the corral, an' quit him on the top end of a high one, you're
a-goin' to look like a rainbow before you git back."

The other scowled: "I guess if I tie onto one of them outlaws yeh'll
see me climb off 'bout the time the money's ready.  Yeh Texas fellers
comes up here an' makes yer brag about showin' us Montana boys how to
ride our own horses.  But it's real money talks!  I don't notice you
backin' up yer brag with no real _dinero_."

Tex was still smiling.  "That's because I ain't found anyone damn fool
enough to bet agin' me."

"Didn't I jest tell yeh I was bettin' agin' you?"

"Don't bet enough to hurt you none.  How much you got, three dollars?
An' how much odds you got to get before you'll risk 'em?"

Purdy reached for his hip pocket.  "Jest to show yeh what I think of
yer ridin' I'll bet yeh even yeh don't win."

"Well," drawled the Texan, "seein' as they won't be only about ten
fellows ride, that makes the odds somewhere around ten to one, which is
about right.  How much you want to bet?"

With his fingers clutching his roll of bills, Purdy's eyes sought the
face of Cinnabar Joe.  For an instant he hesitated and then slammed the
roll onto the bar.

"She goes as she lays.  Count it!"

The bartender picked up the money and ran it through.  "Eighty-five,"
he announced, laconically.

"That's more'n I got on me," said Tex ruefully, as he smoothed out
three or four crumpled bills and capped the pile with a gold piece.

Purdy sneered: "It's money talks," he repeated truculently.  "'Tain't
hardly worth while foolin' with no piker bets but if that's the best
yeh c'n do I'll drag down to it."  He reached for his roll.

"Hold on!" The Texan was still smiling but there was a hard note in his
voice.  "She goes as she lays."  He turned to the half-breed who stood
close at his elbow.

"Bat.  D'you recollect one night back in Las Vegas them four bits I
loant you?  Well, just you shell out about forty dollars interest on
them four bits an' we'll call it square for a while."  The half-breed
smiled broadly and handed over his roll.

"Forty-five, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty--" counted Tex, and with a
five-dollar bill between his thumb and forefinger, eyed Purdy
condescendingly: "I'm a-goin' to let you drag down that five if you
want to," he said, "'cause you've sure kissed good-bye to the rest of
it.  They ain't any of your doggoned Montana school-ma'm-cayuses but
what I c'n ride slick-heeled, an' with my spurs on--" he paused;
"better drag down the five.  You might need a little loose change if
that girl should happen to get thirsty between dances."

"Jest leave it lay," retorted Purdy; "an' at that, I'll bet I buy her
more drinks than what you do."

Tex laughed: "Sure.  But there ain't nothin' in buyin' 'em drinks.
I've bought 'em drinks all night an' then some other _hombre_'d step in
an'----"

"I'd bet yeh on _that_, too.  I didn't notice her fallin' no hell of a
ways fer you."

"Mebbe not.  I wasn't noticin' her much.  I was kind of studyin' the
pilgrim that was along with her."

"What's he got to do with it?"

"That's what I was tryin' to figger out.  But, hey, Cinnabar, how about
that drink?  I'm dry as a post-hole."

"Fill 'em up, Cinnabar.  I'm makin' this noise," seconded Purdy.  And
as the Texan turned to greet an acquaintance, he caught out of the tail
of his eye the glance that flashed between Purdy and the bartender.
Noticed, also out of the tail of his eye, that, contrary to custom,
Cinnabar filled the glasses himself and that a few drops of colourless
liquid splashed from the man's palm into the liquor that was shoved
toward him.  The Texan knew that Purdy had watched the operation
interestedly and that he straightened with an audible sigh of relief at
its conclusion.  "Come on, drink up!"  Purdy raised his glass as Tex
faced the bar with narrowed eyes.

"What's them fellows up to?" cried Cinnabar Joe, and as Purdy turned,
glass in hand, to follow his glance Tex saw the bartender swiftly
substitute his own glass for the one into which he had dropped the
liquid.

The next instant Purdy was again facing him.  "What fellers?" he asked
sharply.

Cinnabar Joe laughed: "Oh, that Bear Paw Pool bunch.  Fellow's got to
keep his eye peeled whenever they git their heads together.  Here's
luck."

For only an instant did Tex hesitate while his brain worked rapidly.
"There's somethin' bein' pulled off here," he reasoned, "that I ain't
next to.  If that booze was doped why did Cinnabar drink it?  Anyways,
he pulled that stall on Purdy fer some reason an' it's up to me to see
him through with it.  But if I do git doped it won't kill me an' when I
come alive they's a couple of fellows goin' to have to ride like hell
to keep ahead of me."

He drank the liquor and as he returned the glass to the bar he noted
the glance of satisfaction that flashed into Purdy's eyes.

"Come on, boys, let's git things a-goin'!"  Mayor Maloney stood in the
doorway and beamed good humouredly: "'Tain't every cowtown's got a bank
an' us Wolf Riverites has got to do ourself proud.  Every rancher an'
nester in forty mile around has drove in.  The flat's rimmed with
wagons an' them train folks is cocked up on the lumber piles
a-chickerin' like a prairie-dog town.  We'll pull off the racin' an'
trick ridin' an' shootin' first an' save the ropin' an' buckin'
contests to finish off on.  Come on, you've all had enough to drink.
Jump on your horses an' ride out on the flat like hell was tore loose
fer recess.  Then when I denounce what's a-comin', them that's goin' to
complete goes at it, an' the rest pulls off to one side an' looks on
'til their turn comes."

A six-shooter roared and a bullet crashed into the ceiling.

"Git out of the way we're a-goin' by!" howled someone, and instantly
the chorus drowned the rattle of spurs and the clatter of high-heeled
boots as the men crowded to the door.

  "Cowboys out on a yip ti yi!
  Coyotes howl and night birds cry
  And we'll be cowboys 'til we die!"

Out in the street horses snorted and whirled against each other, spurs
rattled, and leather creaked as the men leaped into their saddles.
With a thunder of hoofs, a whirl of white dust, the slapping of quirts
and ropes against horses' flanks, the wicked bark of forty-fives, and a
series of Comanche-like yells the cowboys dashed out onto the flat.
Once more Tex Benton found himself drawn up side by side with Jack
Purdy before the girl, for whose handkerchief they had raced.   Both
waved their hats, and Alice smiled as she waved her handkerchief in
return.

"Looks like I was settin' back with an ace in the hole, so far,"
muttered Tex, audibly.

Purdy scowled: "Ace in the hole's all right _sometimes_.  But it's the
lad that trails along with a pair of deuces back to back that comes up
with the chips, cashin' in time."

Slim Maloney announced a quarter-mile dash and when Purdy lined up with
the starters, Tex quietly eased his horse between two wagons, and,
slipping around behind the lumber-piles, rode back to the Headquarters
Saloon.  The place was deserted and in a chair beside a card table,
with his head buried in his arms, sat Cinnabar Joe, asleep.  The
cowpuncher crossed the room and shook him roughly by the shoulder:

"Hey, Joe--wake up!"

The man rolled uneasily and his eyelids drew heavily apart.  He mumbled
incoherently.

"Wake up, Joe!"  The Texan redoubled his efforts but the other relapsed
into a stupor from which it was impossible to rouse him.

A man hurrying past in the direction of the flats paused for a moment
to peer into the open door.  Tex glanced up as he hurried on.

"Doc!"  There was no response and the cowpuncher crossed to the door at
a bound.  The street was deserted, and without an instant's hesitation
he dashed into the livery and feed barn next door whose wide aperture
yawned deserted save for the switching of tails and the stamping of
horses' feet in the stalls.  The door of the harness room stood
slightly ajar and Tex jerked it open and entered.  Harness and saddles
littered the floor and depended from long wooden pegs set into the wall
while upon racks hung sweatpads and saddle blankets of every known kind
and description.  Between the floor and the lower edge of the blankets
that occupied a rack at the farther side of the room a pair of black
leather shoes showed.

"Come on, Doc, let's go get a drink."  The shoes remained motionless.
"Gosh!  There's a rat over in under them blankets!"  A forty-five
hammer was drawn back with a sharp click.  The shoes left the floor
simultaneously and the head and shoulders of a man appeared above the
rack.

"Eh!  Was someone calling me?"

"Yeh, I was speakin' of rats----"

"My hearing's getting bad.  I was fishing around for my saddle blanket.
Those barn dogs never put anything where it belongs."

"That's right.  I said let's go get a drink.  C'n you hear that?"  Tex
noted that the man's face was white and that he was eyeing him
intently, as he approached through the litter.

"Just had one, thanks.  Was on my way down to the flats to see the fun,
and thought I'd see if my blanket had dried out all right."

"Yes?  Didn't you hear me when I hollered at you in the saloon a minute
ago?"

"No.  Didn't know any one was in there."

"You're in a hell of a fix with your eyesight an' hearin' all shot to
pieces, ain't you?  But I reckon they're goin' to be the best part of
you if you don't come along with me.  Cinnabar Joe's be'n doped."

"_Cinnabar Joe_!"  The doctor's surprise was genuine.

"Yes.  Cinnabar Joe.  An' you better get on the job an' bring him to,
or they'll be tossin' dry ones in on top of you about tomorrow.  Sold
any drugs that w'd do a man that way, lately?"

The doctor knitted his brow.  "Why let's see.  I don't remember----"

"Your mem'ry ain't no better'n what your eyesight an' hearin' is, is
it?  I reckon mebbe a little jolt might get it to workin'."  As Tex
talked even on, his fist shot out and landed squarely upon the other's
nose and the doctor found himself stretched at full length among the
saddles and odds and ends of harness.  Blood gushed from his nose and
flowed in a broad wet stream across his cheek.  He struggled weakly to
his feet and interposed a shaking arm.

"I didn't do anything to you," he whimpered.

"No.  I'm the one that's doin'.  Is your parts workin' better?  'Cause
if they ain't----"

"What do you want to know?  I'll tell you!"  The man spoke hurriedly as
he cringed from the doubling fist.

"I know you sold the dope, 'cause when I told you about Cinnabar you
wasn't none surprised at the dope--but at who'd got it.  You sold it to
Jack Purdy an' you knew he aimed to give it to me.  What's more, your
eyesight an' hearin' is as good as mine.  You seen me an' heard me in
the saloon an' you was scairt an' run an' hid in the harness room.
You're a coward, an' a crook, an' a damn liar!  Wolf River don't need
you no more.  You're a-comin' along with me an' fix Cinnabar up an'
then you're a-goin' to go down to the depot an' pick you out a train
that don't make no local stops an' climb onto it an' ride 'til you get
where the buffalo grass don't grow.  That is, onless Cinnabar should
happen to cash in.  If he does----"

"He won't!  He won't!  It's only chloral.  A little strychnine will fix
him up."

"Better get busy then.  'Cause if he ain't to in an hour or so you're
a-goin' to flutter on the down end of a tight one.  These here
cross-arms on the railroad's telegraph poles is good an' stout an' has
the added advantage of affordin' good observation for all, which if you
use a cottonwood there's always some that can't see good on account of
limbs an' branches bein' in the road----"

"Come over to the office 'til I get what I need and I'll bring him
around all right!" broke in the doctor and hurried away, with the
cowpuncher close at his heels.


CHAPTER V

ON THE FLAT

As Mayor Maloney had said, every rancher and nester within forty miles
of Wolf River had driven into town for the celebration.  Farm wagons,
spring wagons, and automobiles were drawn wheel to wheel upon both
sides of the flat.  From the vehicles women and children in holiday
attire applauded the feats of the cowboys with cheers and the waving of
handkerchiefs, while the men stood about in groups and watched with
apparent indifference as they talked of fences and flumes.

From the top of the lumber piles, and the long low roof of the wool
warehouse, the train passengers entered into the spirit of the fun
gasping in horror at some seemingly miraculous escape from death
beneath the pounding hoofs of the cow-horses, only to cheer themselves
hoarse when they saw that the apparent misadventure had been purposely
staged for their benefit.

Races were won by noses.  Hats, handkerchiefs, and even coins were
snatched from the ground by riders who hung head and shoulder below
their horses' bellies.  Mounts were exchanged at full gallop.  Playing
cards were pierced by the bullets of riders who dashed past them at
full speed.  And men emptied their guns in the space of seconds without
missing a shot.

In each event the gaudily caparisoned Jack Purdy was at the fore,
either winning or crowding the winner to his supremest effort.  And it
was Purdy who furnished the real thrill of the shooting tournament
when, with a six-shooter in each hand, he jumped an empty tomato can
into the air at fifteen paces by sending a bullet into the ground
beneath its base and pierced it with a bullet from each gun before it
returned to earth.

A half-dozen times he managed to slip over for a few words with Alice
Marcum--a bit of explanation of a coming event, or a comment upon the
fine points of a completed one, until unconsciously the girl's interest
centred upon the dashing figure to an extent that she found herself
following his every movement, straining forward when his supremacy hung
in the balance, keenly disappointed when another wrested the honours
from him, and jubilantly exultant at his victories.  Most of his important
pictures are in public galleries.

Hogarth was a fine engraver, and left many plates after his own works,
which are far better and more spirited than another artist could have
made them. The pictures of Hogarth have good qualities aside from
their peculiar features.

He made his interiors spacious, and the furniture and all the
details were well arranged; his costumes were exact, as was also the
expression of his faces; his painting was good, and his color
excellent. In 1753 he published a book called the "Analysis of
Beauty."

Ever after his first success his career was a prosperous one. He rode
in his carriage, and was the associate and friend of men in good
positions.

Hogarth was buried in Chiswick Churchyard, and on his tombstone are these
lines, written by David Garrick:

"Farewell, great painter of mankind!
Who reach'd the noblest point of Art, Whose pictur'd morals charm the
mind, And through the eye, correct the heart.

If Genius fire thee, reader, stay; If Nature touch thee, drop a tear;
If neither move thee, turn away, For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies
here."
The next important English painter was RICHARD WILSON (1713-1782), and
he was important not so much for what he painted as for the fact that
he was one of the earliest landscape-painters among English artists.

He never attained wealth or great reputation, although after his
return from studying in Italy he was made a member of the Royal
Academy.

We come now to Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS (1723-1792), born at Plympton,
in Devonshire. His father was a clergyman and the master of the grammar
school at Plympton. Joshua was destined for the medical profession by
his parents; but his love of drawing was so marked that, as the
opportunity offered for him to go to London and study under Hudson,
his father allowed him to do so. After various changes, in 1749
he was able to go to Rome, and remained in Italy three years (Fig.
70).

When he returned to England he soon attracted attention to his pictures,
and it was not long before both fame and fortune were secured to him.
His life was a very quiet one, with little of incident that
can be related here. His sister kept his house for him, and he lived
generously, having company to dinner almost daily.

His friends were among the best people of the time, including such persons
as Dr. Johnson, Percy, Goldsmith, Garrick, the Burkes, and many
others.

The day before Johnson died he told Reynolds that he had three
requests to make of him: that he would forgive him thirty pounds which
he had lent him, would read the Scriptures daily, and would not paint
on Sunday. Sir Joshua promised to do these things, and remembered
his promise.

Sir Joshua was skilful in compliments. When he painted his famous
picture of Mrs. Siddons as the "Tragic Muse" he put his name on the
border of her garment.

The actress went near the picture to examine it, and when she saw the
name she smiled. The artist said: "I could not lose the opportunity
of sending my name to posterity on the hem of your garment."
[Illustration: FIG. 72.--"MUSCIPULA." _By Reynolds._]
Sir Joshua Reynolds' fame rests upon his portraits, and in these
he is almost unrivalled. His pictures of children are especially
fine.

It was his custom to receive six sitters daily. He kept a list of
those who were sitting and of others who waited for an opportunity
to have their portraits made by him.

He also had sketches of the different portraits he had painted, and
when new-comers had looked them over and chosen the position they
wished, he sketched it on canvas and then made the likeness to correspond.
In this way, when at his best, he was able to paint a portrait in
about four hours.

His sitters' chairs moved on casters, and were placed on a platform a
foot and a half above the floor. He worked standing, and used brushes
with handles eighteen inches long, moving them with great rapidity.

In 1768 Sir Joshua was made the first President of the Royal Academy,
and it was then that he was knighted by the king. He read lectures at
the Academy until 1790, when he took his leave. During these years
he sent two hundred and forty-four pictures to the various exhibitions.
In 1782 he had a slight shock of paralysis, but was quite well
until 1789, when he feared that he should be blind, and from this
time he did not paint. He was ill about three months before his
death, which occurred in February, 1792.

His remains were laid in state at the Royal Academy, and then buried
in St.
Paul's Cathedral, near the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren.

It is to be regretted that the colors used by Sir Joshua Reynolds are
now much faded in many of his pictures. Those in the National Gallery,
in London, are, however, in good preservation. Naturally, since so many
of his pictures were portraits they are in the collections of
private families in England, and but few of them are seen in European
galleries.

There is an excellent opportunity to study his manner in the pictures
at the South Kensington Museum, where there are several portraits,
some pictures of children, and the "Graces Decorating a Statue of
Hymen."

It is very satisfactory to think of a great artist as a genial,
happy man, who is dear to his friends, and has a full, rich life
outside of his profession.

Such a life had Sir Joshua Reynolds, and one writer says of him: "They
made him a knight--this famous painter; they buried him 'with an
empire's lamentation;' but nothing honors him more than the 'folio
English dictionary of the last revision' which Johnson left to him
in his will, the dedication that poor, loving Goldsmith placed in
the 'Deserted Village,' and the tears which five years after his
death even Burke could not forbear to shed over his memory."

THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH (1727-1788) was born in Sudbury, in Suffolk, and
when still quite young went to London, and studied under Francis
Hayman, who was not an eminent painter.

Gainsborough became one of the most important masters of the English
school, especially in landscape painting and the representation of
rustic figures. His portraits were not as good in color as those of
Sir Joshua Reynolds; they have a bluish-gray hue in the flesh
tints; but they are always graceful and charming. His landscapes
are not like those of any other master. They are not exact in the
detail of leaves and flowers--a botanist could find many faults in
them--but they are like nature in spirit: they seem to have the
air blowing through them, they are fresh and dewy when it is morning
in them, and quiet and peaceful when evening comes under his brush.
In many of his pictures he put a cart and a white animal.

His rustic figures have the true country life in them: they seem to
have fed upon the air, and warmed themselves in the sun until they are
plump and rosy as country lads and lasses should be. His best _genre_
pictures are the "Cottage Girl," the "Woodman and Dog in a Storm," the
"Cottage Door," and the "Shepherd Boy in a Shower." He painted a picture
of a "Girl and Pigs," for which Sir Joshua Reynolds paid him one
hundred guineas.

In character Gainsborough was very attractive, though somewhat
contradictory in his moods.

He was generous and genial, lovable and affectionate; he was also
contradictory and impulsive, not to say capricious. His wife and he
had little quarrels which they settled in this wise: When Gainsborough
had spoken to her unkindly, he would quickly repent, and write a
note to say so, and address it to his wife's spaniel, called
"Tristram," and sign it with the name of his pet dog, "Fox."

Then Margaret Gainsborough would answer: "My own, dear Fox, you are
always loving and good, and I am a naughty little female ever to
worry you as I too often do, so we will kiss, and say no more about it;
your own affectionate Tris." Like Reynolds, Gainsborough had many warm
friends, and when he died Sir Joshua himself watched by his bedside, and
bent to catch his last word, which was the name of Vandyck.

JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY (1737-1815) was born in Boston, Mass., U. S., to
which place his parents are said to have immigrated from Limerick,
Ireland. The father was descended from the Copleys of Yorkshire,
England, and the mother from the Singletons of County Clare, both
families of note.
When young Copley was eleven years old his mother was married to Peter
Pelham, a widower with three sons--Peter, Charles, and William--and who
subsequently became the father of another son, Henry, by this second
marriage. Mr. Pelham was a portrait painter and a mezzotint engraver
of unusual merit. One authority calls him "the founder of those arts in
New England." Mr. Pelham was also a man of education, a land surveyor,
and a mathematician. He was thus well qualified to educate, assist,
and stimulate young Copley in the pursuit of studies so natural
and congenial to him.

He is said to have been studious and quiet, and to have made rapid
advances.

When he was fifteen years old he painted a portrait of his step-brother,
Charles Pelham, now in the family of a great-grandson, Mr.
Charles Pelham Curtis, of Boston. At sixteen he published an engraving
of Rev. William Welsteed, from a portrait painted by himself. The same
year he painted the portrait of a child--afterward Dr. de Mountfort--now
owned in Detroit. In 1754 he painted an allegorical picture of Mars,
Venus, and Vulcan, thirty inches long by twenty-five wide, now owned in
Bridgewater, Mass. The next year he painted a miniature of George
Washington, who was on a visit to Governor Shirley at the time.
This picture now belongs to the family of the late George P. Putnam, of
New York City.

In 1756 he painted a three-quarters length portrait of General
William Brattle, life size, signed and dated, and now owned by Mr.

William S. Appleton. He now improved rapidly. A crayon portrait of Miss
Rebecca Gardiner, afterward Mrs. Philip Dumaresq, an oil painting
of Mrs.

Edmund Perkins, a portrait of Rebecca Boylston, afterward wife of Governor
Gill, portraits of Colonel and Mrs.

Lee, grandparents of General William Raymond Lee, all exist and attest
the continued growth of his powers. These date between 1763 and 1769.
During this time he had access to and was a visitor in houses where were
portraits by Saribest, Blackburn, Liopoldt, and even by Vandyck and Sir
Godfrey Kneller. Mr. Augustus Thorndike Perkins, in his carefully
written monograph on Copley, says that our artist must have seen all
these pictures, since, as Dr. Gardiner says, "his genial disposition
and his courtly manners make him a welcome guest everywhere." Mr.
Perkins remarks that Copley must have studied with Blackburn; that he
imitated, but in some respects surpassed him.

"Both frequently used, either as the lining of a dress or as drapery,
a certain shade of mauve pink; Blackburn uses this shade feebly,
while Copley dashes it on with the hand of a master."

On November 16, 1769, Copley married Susan (or Susannah, as it is sometimes
written), the daughter of Mr. Richard Clarke, a distinguished merchant
of Boston, to whom, as agent of the East India Company of London, was
consigned the tea thrown overboard in Boston harbor. From all accounts
he soon began to live in good style; and as, in 1771, Colonel Trumbull
found him living opposite the Common, it is probable that he purchased
at about that time the property which afterward became so valuable,
although long after Copley had ceased to be the owner. In 1773, says
the late eminent conveyancer, Nathaniel Ingersoll Bowditch, "Copley
owned all the land bounded on the west by Charles River, thence by
Beacon Street to Walnut Street, thence by Walnut Street to Mt.

Vernon Street, thence by Mt.
Vernon Street to Louisburg Square, thence by Louisburg Square
to Pinckney Street, thence by Pinckney Street to the water, containing
about eleven acres of land." This land is now covered with handsome
residences, and is of great value. An agent of Copley's sold his property
after he went abroad without being authorized to do so, and,
although his son came over in 1795 to look into the matter, he was
only able to secure a compromise by which a further sum of three
thousand guineas was paid in final settlement.

Soon after his marriage Copley painted his picture of a "Boy with a
Squirrel," which he sent anonymously to Benjamin West, in London, for
exhibition. West judged from the wood on which the picture was
stretched and from the kind of squirrel that the work was American,
and so excellent was the painting that a rule of the institution
was set aside, and the picture exhibited.

This picture is now in the possession of Mrs. James S.
Amory, of Boston, a granddaughter of the artist. The boy in the picture
was his half-brother Henry. The picture was so favorably received
that Copley was advised to go to England. He sailed in 1774, and never
returned.

Mr. Copley, soon after his arrival in London, passed over to the
Continent, and through Italy, studying in Parma and in Rome. He visited
Naples and Pæstum also. It is said that he studied so diligently that
he was with difficulty persuaded to paint two portraits in Rome.

In 1775 he travelled and studied in Germany, in Holland, and in France.
This same year his wife and family joined him in England. These consisted
of his wife, his son, John Singleton, who afterward became the
famous Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst; his daughter Elizabeth, afterward
married to a distinguished merchant in Boston, and who survived to
a great age; Mary Copley, who lived unmarried to the great age of
ninety-four; and another son who died young.

In 1777 he was made an Associate of the Royal Academy, and six years
later an Academician.

He was now in the full tide of success.

He was offered five hundred guineas to paint a family group of six
persons.

The well-known group of Copley's family, called the "Family Picture,"
the "Death of Lord Chatham," and "Watson and the Shark," were on
his easel in 1780.

The picture of Lord Chatham falling senseless in the House of Lords
was commenced soon after his death in 1778. It was engraved by Bartolozzi,
and twenty-five hundred copies were sold in a few weeks.

Copley exhibited the picture, to his own profit as well as fame.

In 1781 occurred the death of Major Pierson, shot in the moment of victory
over the French troops who had invaded the island of Jersey.

His death was instantly avenged by his black servant, and of this
scene Copley made one of his finest pictures.

He took pains, with his usual honesty, to go to St.

Helier's, and make a drawing of the locality. The picture is thoroughly
realistic, although painful.

His large picture of the "Repulse and Defeat of the Spanish Floating
Batteries at Gibraltar" was painted on commission from the city
of London.

It is twenty-five feet long by twenty-two and a half feet high; but
there are so many figures and so much distance to be shown in the
painting that the artist really needed more room. Of the commander, Lord
Heathfield, Sir Robert Royd, Sir William Green, and some twelve or
fifteen others, the artist made careful portraits.

The story told by Elkanah Watson shows Copley's strong sympathy for
America.

In 1782 Watson was in London, and Copley made a full-length portrait
of him, and in his journal Watson says: "The painting was finished
in most exquisite style in every part, except the background,
which Copley and I designed to represent a ship bearing to America
the acknowledgments of our independence. The sun was just rising upon
the stripes of the Union streaming from her gaff.

All was complete save the flag, which Copley did not deem proper
to hoist under the present circumstances, as his gallery was
the constant resort of the royal family and the nobility. I dined
with the artist on the glorious 5th of December, 1782. After listening
with him to the speech of the king formally recognizing the United
States of America as in the rank of nations, previous to dinner, and
immediately after our return from the House of Lords, he invited
me into his studio, and there, with a bold hand, a master's touch, and,
I believe, an American heart, he attached to the ship the stars and
stripes.

This was, I imagine, the first American flag hoisted in Old England."

Copley purchased, for a London residence, the mansion-house in George
Street belonging to Lord Fauconburg. It afterward became more widely
known as the residence of his son, Lord Lyndhurst. Lord Mansfield's
residence was near by, and among the many commissions from public
men was one to paint his lordship's portrait.

Perhaps one of the most interesting of all his commissions was one to
paint the picture of Charles I. demanding the five obnoxious members
from the Long Parliament, for which a number of gentlemen in Boston
paid one thousand five hundred pounds.

It is said that every face in this great picture was taken from a
portrait at that time extant; and Mrs. Gardiner Greene narrates that
she and her father were driven in a post-chaise over a considerable
part of England, visiting every house in which there was a picture
of a member of the famous Parliament, and were always received as
honored guests.

Copley's painting of the death of Lord Chatham was much admired. So
numerous were the subscriptions for the engraving that it is said Copley
must have received nearly, or quite, eleven thousand pounds for the
picture and the engraved copies. It was quite natural for Copley to
be popular with New Englanders; indeed, almost every Bostonian, at one
time, on visiting London, made a point to bring home his portrait
by Copley, if possible.

There are known to exist in this country two hundred and sixty-nine
oil-paintings, thirty-five crayons, and fourteen miniatures by him.
These pictures are carefully cherished, as are indeed all memorials
of this generous and kindly gentleman. Although his life was mostly
passed in England, where he obtained wealth and renown, yet in a strong
sense he could be claimed for Boston, as it was there he was born; it
was there he received his artistic bias and education; it was there
he was married, and had three children born to him; and, finally, it
was there that he acquired a fair amount of fame and property
solely by his brush.

It will be worth while for the readers of this volume to take pains
to see some of the more noteworthy Copleys.

A portrait of John Adams, full length, painted in London in 1783,
is now in possession of Harvard College.

A portrait of Samuel Adams, three-quarters length, spirited and beautiful,
standing by a table, and holding a paper, hangs in Faneuil Hall.

Another picture of Samuel Adams is in Harvard College, which also owns
several other Copleys. A portrait of James Allen, a man of
fortune, a patriot, and a scholar, is now owned by the Massachusetts
Historical Society.

The "Copley Family," one of the artist's very best pictures, is now owned
in Boston by Mr. Amory, and, in fact, Mrs. James S. Amory owns a number
of his best works.

Copley was a man of elegance and dignity, fond of the beautiful, particular
in his dress, hospitable, and a lover of poetry and the arts.
His favorite book was said to be "Paradise Lost." His last picture was
on the subject of the Resurrection.

BENJAMIN WEST (1738-1820) was born at Springfield, Pennsylvania,
of Quaker parentage.

In the various narratives of his successful life many stories are told
which appear somewhat fabulous, and most of which have nothing to do
with his subsequent career.

He is said to have made a pen-and-ink portrait of his little niece
at the age of seven years; to have shaved the cat's tail for paint
brushes; to have received instruction in painting and archery from
the Indians; to have so far conquered the prejudices of his relatives
and their co-religionists to his adoption of an artist's life that
he was solemnly consecrated to it by the laying on of hands by the
men, and the simultaneous kissing of the women.

His love for art must have been very strong, and he was finally
indulged, and assisted in it by his relatives, so that at the age
of eighteen he was established as a portrait-painter in Philadelphia.

By the kindness of friends in that city and in New York he was enabled
to go to Italy, where he remained three years, making friends and
reputation everywhere. Parma, Florence, and Bologna elected him a member
of their Academies. He was only twenty-five years old when he went
to England, on his way back to America.

But he was so well received that he finally determined to remain in
England, and a young lady named Elizabeth Shewell, to whom he had
become engaged before going abroad, was kind and judicious enough to
join him in London, where she became his wife, and was his faithful
helpmate for fifty years.

In 1766 he exhibited his "Orestes and Pylades," which on account
of its novelty and merit produced a sensation.

He painted "Agrippina weeping over the Urn of Germanicus," and by
the Archbishop of York was introduced to George III. as its author.

He immediately gained favor with the king, and was installed at
Windsor as the court-painter with a salary of one thousand pounds
per annum.

This salary and position was continued for thirty-three years.

He painted a series of subjects on a grand scale from the life of
Edward III. for St.

George's Hall, and twenty-eight scriptural subjects, besides nine portrait
pictures of the royal family. In 1792, on the death of Reynolds,
he was elected President of the Royal Academy, a position which, except
a brief interregnum, he held until his death in March, 1820. He was
greatly praised in his day, and doubtless thought himself a great artist.
He painted a vast number of portraits and quite a number of pictures
of classical and historical subjects. His "Lear" is in the Boston
Athenæum; his "Hamlet and Ophelia" is in the Longworth collection in
Cincinnati; "Christ Healing the Sick" is in the Pennsylvania
Hospital; and the "Rejected Christ" is or was owned by Mr.

Harrison, of Philadelphia.

There are two portraits of West, one by Allston and one by Leslie,
in the Boston Athenæum, and a full-length, by Sir Thomas Lawrence,
in the Wadsworth Gallery in Hartford, Conn.

One of West's pictures did a great deal for his reputation, although
it was quite a departure from the treatment and ideas then in
vogue; this was the "Death of General Wolfe" on the Plains of
Abraham. When it was known to artists and amateurs that his purpose
was to depict the scene as it really might have happened he was
greatly ridiculed. Even Sir Joshua Reynolds expressed an opinion
against it; but when he saw the picture he owned that West was
right.
Hitherto no one had painted a scene from contemporary history with
figures dressed in the costume of the day. But West depicted each officer
and soldier in his uniform, and gave every man his pig-tail who wore
one. The picture is spirited and well grouped. West was just such a
practical, thoughtful, and kindly man as we might expect from his ancestry
and surroundings.

GEORGE ROMNEY (1734-1802), born in Beckside, near Dalton, in Cumberland.

He married when he was twenty-two, and in his twenty-seventh year went
to London with only thirty pounds in his pocket, leaving his wife
with seventy pounds and two young children.

He returned home to die in 1799, and in the meantime saw his wife but
twice. The year after his arrival in London he carried off the fifty-guinea
prize on the subject of the "Death of Wolfe" from the Society of
Arts.

Through the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds this was reconsidered, and
the fifty-guinea prize was awarded to Mortimer for his "Edward the
Confessor," while Romney was put off with a gratuity of twenty-five
guineas. This produced a feud between the two artists. Romney showed
his resentment by exhibiting in a house in Spring Gardens, and
never sending a picture to the Academy, while Reynolds would not
so much as mention his name, but spoke of him as "the man in Cavendish
Square."

"No.  But I have never lived in a country where it is done.  I have
always understood that cowboys were proficient along those lines, but
why shouldn't they be?  It's their business----"

"There you go--reducing everything to terms of business!  Can't you see
the romance of it--what it stands for?  The wild free life of the
plains, the daily battling with the elements, and the mastery of nerve
and skill over blind brute force and fury!  I love it!  And tonight I'm
going to a real cowboy dance."

"Alice!"  The word carried a note of grave disapproval.  "Surely you
were not serious about attending that orgy!"

The girl stared at him in surprise.  "Serious!  Of course I'm serious!
When will I ever get another chance to attend a cowboy dance--and with
a real cowboy, too?"

"The whole thing is preposterous!  Perfectly absurd!  If you are bound
to attend that affair I will take you there, and we can look on and----"

"I don't want to look on.  I want to dance--to be in it all.  It will
be an experience I'll never forget."

The man nodded: "And one you may never cease to regret.  What do you
know of that man?  Of his character; of his antecedents?  He may be the
veriest desperado for all you know."

The girl clapped her hands in mock delight: "Oh, wouldn't that be
grand!  I hadn't thought of that.  To attend a dance with just a plain
cowboy doesn't fall to every girl's lot, but one who is a cowboy and a
desperado, too!"  She rolled her eyes to express the seventh heavendom
of delight.

Endicott ignored the mockery.  "I am sure neither your mother nor your
father----"

"No, neither of them would approve, of course.  But really, Winthrop,
I'm way past the short petticoat stage--though the way they're making
them now nobody would guess it.  I know it's improper and
unconventional and that it isn't done east of the Mississippi nor west
of the Rocky Mountains.  But when in Rome do as the roamers do, as
someone has said.  And as for Mr. Purdy," she paused and looked
Endicott squarely in the eyes.  "Do you know why he didn't shoot that
disgusting Tex when he insulted him?"

Endicott nodded.  "Yes," he answered.  "Because he was afraid to."

Colour suffused the girl's face and she arose abruptly from the table.
"At least," she said haughtily, "you and Wolf River are thoroughly in
accord on _that_ point."

As the man watched her disappear through the doorway he became aware
that the fat woman who had sought refuge under the coach was staring at
him through her lorgnette from her seat across the aisle.

"Young man, I believe you insulted that girl!" she wheezed indignantly.

"You should be a detective, madam.  Not even a great one could be
farther from the truth," he replied dryly, and rising, passed into the
smoking compartment of his Pullman where he consumed innumerable
cigarettes as he stared out into the gathering night.

Seated in her own section of the same Pullman, Alice Marcum sat and
watched the twilight deepen and the lights of the little town twinkle
one by one from the windows.  Alone in the darkening coach the girl was
not nearly so sure she was going to enjoy her forthcoming adventure.
Loud shouts, accompanied by hilarious laughter and an occasional pistol
shot, floated across the flat.  She pressed her lips tighter and
heartily wished that she had declined Purdy's invitation.  It was not
too late, yet.  She could plead a headache, or a slight indisposition.
She knew perfectly well that Endicott had been right and she wrong but,
with the thought, the very feminine perversity of her strengthened her
determination to see the adventure through.

"Men are such fools!" she muttered angrily.  "I'll only stay a little
while, of course, but I'm going to that dance if it is the last thing I
ever do--just to show him that--that--" her words trailed into silence
without expressing just what it was she intended to show him.

As the minutes passed the girl's eyes glowed with a spark of hope.
"Maybe," she muttered, "maybe Mr. Purdy has forgotten, or--" the
sentence broke off shortly.  Across the flat a rider was approaching
and beside him trotted a lead-horse upon whose back was an empty
saddle.  For just an instant she hesitated, then rose from her seat and
walked boldly to the door of the coach.

"Good evenin', mom," the cowboy smiled as he dismounted to assist her
from the steps of the coach.

"Good evening," returned the girl.  "But, you needn't to have gone to
the trouble of bringing a horse just to ride that little way."

"'Twasn't no trouble, mom, an' he's woman broke.  I figured yeh
wouldn't have no ridin' outfit along so I loant a sideways saddle offen
a friend of mine which his gal usta use before she learnt to ride
straddle.  The horse is hern, too, an' gentle as a dog.  Here I'll give
yeh a h'ist."  The lead-horse nickered softly, and reaching up, the
girl stroked his velvet nose.

"He's woman broke," repeated the cowboy, and as Alice looked up her
eyes strayed past him to the window of the coach where they met
Endicott's steady gaze.

The next moment Purdy was lifting her into the saddle, and without a
backward glance the two rode out across the flat.

The girl was a devoted horsewoman and with the feel of the horse under
her, her spirits revived and she drew in a long breath of the fragrant
night.  There was a living tang to the air, soft with the balm of June,
and as they rode side by side the cowboy pointed toward the east where
the sharp edge of the bench cut the rim of the rising moon.  Alice
gasped at the beauty of it.  The horses stopped and the two watched in
silence until the great red disc rose clear of the clean-cut sky-line.

About the wreck torches flared and the night was torn by the clang and
rattle of gears as the great crane swung a boxcar to the side.  The
single street was filled with people--women and men from the wagons,
and cowboys who dashed past on their horses or clumped along the wooden
sidewalk with a musical jangle of spurs.

The dance-hall was a blaze of light toward which the people flocked
like moths to a candle flame.  As they pushed the horses past, the girl
glanced in.  Framed in the doorway stood a man whose eyes met hers
squarely--eyes that, in the lamplight seemed to smile cynically as they
strayed past her and rested for a moment upon her companion, even as
the thin lips were drawn downward at their corners in a sardonic grin.

Unconsciously she brought her quirt down sharply, and her horse, glad
of the chance to stretch his legs after several days in the stall,
bounded forward and taking the bit in his teeth shot past the little
cluster of stores and saloons, past the straggling row of houses and
headed out on the trail that wound in and out among the cottonwood
clumps of the valley.  At first, the girl tried vainly to check the
pace, but as the animal settled to a steady run a spirit of wild
exhilaration took possession of her--the feel of the horse bounding
beneath her, the muffled thud of his hoofs in the soft sand of the
trail, the alternating patches of moonlight and shadow, and the keen
tang of the night air--all seemed calling her, urging her on.

At the point where the trail rose abruptly in its ascent to the bench,
the horse slackened his pace and she brought him to a stand, and for
the first time since she left the town, realized she was not alone.
The realization gave her a momentary start, as Purdy reined in close
beside her; but a glance into the man's face reassured her.

"Oh, isn't it just grand!  I feel as if I could ride on, and on, and
on."

The man nodded and pointed upward where the surface of the bench cut
the sky-line sharply.

"Yes, mom," he answered respectfully.  "If yeh'd admire to, we c'n
foller the trail to the top an' ride a ways along the rim of the bench.
If you like scenes, that ort to be worth while lookin' at.  The dance
won't git a-goin' good fer an hour yet 'til the folks gits het up to
it."

For a moment Alice hesitated.  The romance of the night was upon her.
Every nerve tingled, with the feel of the wild.  Her glance wandered
from the rim of the bench to the cowboy, a picturesque figure as he sat
easily in his saddle, a figure toned by the soft touch of the moonlight
to an intrinsic symbolism of vast open spaces.

Something warned her to go back, but--what harm could there be in just
riding to the top?  Only for a moment--a moment in which she could
feast her eyes upon the widespread panorama of moonlit wonder--and
then, they would be in the little town again before the dance was in
full swing.  In her mind's eye she saw Endicott's disapproving frown,
and with a tightening of the lips she started her horse up the hill and
the cowboy drew in beside her, the soft brim of his Stetson concealing
the glance of triumph that flashed from his eyes.

The trail slanted upward through a narrow coulee that reached the bench
level a half-mile back from the valley.  As the two came out into the
open the girl once more reined her horse to a standstill.  Before her,
far away across the moonlit plain the Bear Paws loomed in mysterious
grandeur.  The clean-cut outline of Miles Butte, standing apart from
the main range, might have been an Egyptian pyramid rising abruptly
from the desert.  From the very centre of the sea of peaks the
snow-capped summit of Big Baldy towered high above Tiger Ridge, and Saw
Tooth projected its serried crown until it seemed to merge into the
Little Rockies which rose indistinct out of the dim beyond.

The cowboy turned abruptly from the trail and the two headed their
horses for the valley rim, the animals picking their way through the
patches of prickly pears and clumps of low sage whose fragrant aroma
rose as a delicate incense to the nostrils of the girl.

Upon the very brink of the valley they halted, and in awed silence
Alice sat drinking in the exquisite beauty of the scene.

Before her as far as the eye could see spread the broad reach of the
Milk River Valley, its obfusk depths relieved here and there by bright
patches of moonlight, while down the centre, twisting in and out among
the dark clumps of cottonwoods, the river wound like a ribbon of
gleaming silver.  At widely scattered intervals the tiny lights of
ranch houses glowed dull yellow in the distance, and almost at her feet
the clustering lights of the town shone from the open windows and doors
of buildings which stood out distinctly in the moonlight, like a
village in miniature.  Faint sounds, scarcely audible in the stillness
of the night floated upward--the thin whine of fiddles, a shot now and
then from the pistol of an exuberant cowboy sounding tiny and far away
like the report of a boy's pop-gun.

The torches of the wrecking crew flickered feebly and the drone of
their hoisting gears scarce broke the spell of the silence.

Minutes passed as the girl's eyes feasted upon the details of the scene.

"Oh, isn't it wonderful!" she breathed, and then in swift alarm,
glanced suddenly into the man's face.  Unnoticed he had edged his horse
close so that his leg brushed hers in the saddle.  The hat brim did not
conceal the eyes now, that stared boldly into her face and in sudden
terror the girl attempted to whirl her horse toward the trail.  But the
man's arm shot out and encircled her waist and his hot breath was upon
her cheek.  With all the strength of her arm she swung her quirt, but
Purdy held her close; the blow served only to frighten the horses which
leaped apart, and the girl felt herself dragged from the saddle.


In the smoking compartment of the Pullman, Endicott finished a
cigarette as he watched the girl ride toward the town in company with
Purdy.

"She's a--a headstrong _little fool_!" he growled under his breath.  He
straightened out his legs and stared gloomily at the brass cuspidor.
"Well, I'm through.  I vowed once before I'd never have anything more
to do with her--and yet--"  He hurled the cigarette at the cuspidor and
took a turn up and down the cramped quarters of the little room.  Then
he stalked to his seat, met the fat lady's outraged stare with an
ungentlemanly scowl, procured his hat, and stamped off across the flat
in the direction of the dance-hall.  As he entered the room a feeling
of repugnance came over him.  The floor was filled with noisy dancers,
and upon a low platform at the opposite end of the room three
shirt-sleeved, collarless fiddlers sawed away at their instruments, as
they marked time with boots and bodies, pausing at intervals to mop
their sweat-glistening faces, or to swig from a bottle proffered by a
passing dancer.  Rows of onlookers of both sexes crowded the walls and
Endicott's glance travelled from face to face in a vain search for the
girl.

A little apart from the others the Texan leaned against the wall.  The
smoke from a limp cigarette which dangled from the corner of his lips
curled upward, and through the haze of it Endicott saw that the man was
smiling unpleasantly.  Their eyes met and Endicott turned toward the
door in hope of finding the girl among the crowd that thronged the
street.

Hardly had he reached the sidewalk when he felt a hand upon his arm,
and turned to stare in surprise into the dark features of a
half-breed,--the same, he remembered, who had helped the Texan to
saddle the outlaw.  With a swift motion of the head the man signalled
him to follow, and turned abruptly into the deep shadow of an alley
that led along the side of the livery bam.  Something in the
half-breed's manner caused Endicott to obey without hesitation and a
moment later the man turned and faced him.

"You hont you 'oman?" Endicott nodded impatiently and the half-breed
continued: "She gon' ridin' wit Purdy."  He pointed toward the winding
trail.  "Mebbe-so you hur' oop, you ketch."  Without waiting for a
reply the man slipped the revolver from his holster and pressed it into
the astonished Endicott's hand, and catching him by the sleeve, hurried
him to the rear of the stable where, tied to the fence of the corral,
two horses stood saddled.  Loosing one, the man passed him the bridle
reins.  "Dat hoss, she damn good hoss.  Mebbe-so you ride lak' hell you
com' long in tam'.  Dat Purdy, she not t'ink you got de gun, mebbe-so
you git chance to kill um good."  As the full significance of the man's
words dawned upon him Endicott leaped into the saddle and, dashing from
the alley, headed at full speed out upon the winding, sandy trail.  On
and on he sped, flashing in and out among the clumps of cottonwood.  At
the rise of the trail he halted suddenly to peer ahead and listen.  A
full minute he stood while in his ears sounded only the low hum of
mosquitoes and the far-off grind of derrick wheels.

He glanced upward and for a moment his heart stood still.  Far above,
on the rim of the bench, silhouetted clearly against the moonlight sky
were two figures on horseback.  Even as he looked the figures blended
together--there was a swift commotion, a riderless horse dashed from
view, and the next moment the sky-line showed only the rim of the bench.

The moon turned blood-red.  And with a curse that sounded in his ears
like the snarl of a beast, Winthrop Adams Endicott tightened his grip
upon the revolver and headed the horse up the steep ascent.

The feel of his horse labouring up the trail held nothing of
exhilaration for Endicott.  He had galloped out of Wolf River with the
words of the half-breed ringing in his ears: "Mebbe-so you ride lak'
hell you com' long in tam'!"  But, would he "com' long in tam'"?  There
had been something of sinister portent in that swift merging together
of the two figures upon the sky-line, and in the flash-like glimpse of
the riderless horse.  Frantically he dug his spurless heels into the
labouring sides of his mount.

"Mebbe-so you kill um good," the man had said at parting, and as
Endicott rode he knew that he would kill, and for him the knowledge
held nothing of repugnance--only a wild fierce joy.  He looked at the
revolver in his hand.  Never before had the hand held a lethal weapon,
yet no slightest doubt as to his ability to use it entered his brain.
Above him, somewhere upon the plain beyond the bench rim, the woman he
loved was at the mercy of a man whom Endicott instinctively knew would
stop at nothing to gain an end.  The thought that the man he intended
to kill was armed and that he was a dead shot never entered his head,
nor did he remember that the woman had mocked and ignored him, and
against his advice had wilfully placed herself in the man's power.  She
had harried and exasperated him beyond measure--and yet he loved her.

The trail grew suddenly lighter.  The walls of the coulee flattened
into a wide expanse of open.  Mountains loomed in the distance and in
the white moonlight a riderless horse ceased snipping grass, raised his
head, and with ears cocked forward, stared at him.  In a fever of
suspense Endicott gazed about him, straining his eyes to penetrate the
half-light, but the plain stretched endlessly away, and upon its
surface was no living, moving thing.

Suddenly his horse pricked his ears and sniffed.  Out of a near-by
depression that did not show in the moonlight another horse appeared.
It, too, was riderless, and the next instant, from the same direction
sounded a low, muffled cry and, leaping from his saddle, he dashed
toward the spot.  The sage grew higher in the depression which was the
head of a branch of the coulee by means of which the trail gained the
bench, and as he plunged in, the head and shoulders of a man appeared
above a bush.  Endicott was very close when the man pushed something
fiercely from him, and the body of a woman crashed heavily into the
sage.  Levelling the gun, he fired.  The shot rang loud, and upon the
edge of the depression a horse snorted nervously.  The man pitched
forward and lay sprawled grotesquely upon the ground and Endicott saw
that his extended hand grasped a revolver.

Dully he stared at the thing on the ground at his feet.  There was a
movement in the scrub and Alice Marcum stood beside him.  He glanced
into her face.  And as her eyes strayed from the sprawling figure to
meet his, Endicott read in their depths that which caused his heart to
race madly.  She stepped toward him and suddenly both paused to listen.
The girl's face turned chalk-white in the moonlight.  From the
direction of the coulee came the sound of horses' hoofs pounding the
trail!


CHAPTER VII

THE ARREST

Bat Lajune grinned into the dark as the galloping cow-horse carried
Endicott out upon the trail of Purdy and the girl.  "A'm t'ink dat wan
good job.  Mebbe-so de pilgrim keel Purdy, _bien_!  Mebbe-so Purdy keel
de pilgrim, den de sheriff ketch Purdy an' she got for git hang--dat
pret' good, too.  Anyhow, Tex, she don' got for bodder 'bout keel Purdy
no mor'.  Tex kin keel him all right, but dat Purdy she damn good shot,
too.  Mebbe-so she git de drop on Tex.  Den afterwards, me--A'm got to
fool 'roun' an' keel Purdy, an' mebbe-so A'm hang for dat, too.  Wat de
hell!"

A man rode up to the corral and tied his horse to the fence.  The
half-breed drew into the shadow.  "Dat Sam Moore," he muttered.  "She
dipity sher'ff, an' she goin' try for git 'lect for de beeg sher'ff dis
fall.  Mebbe-so she lak' for git chanct for 'rest som'one.  A'm goin'
see 'bout dat."  He stepped to the side of the man, who started
nervously and peered into his face.

"Hello, Bat, what the devil you doin' prowlin' around here?  Why hain't
you in dancin'?"

The half-breed shrugged: "Me, A'm no lak' for dance mooch.  She don' do
no good.  Anyhow, A'm hont 'roun' for fin' you.  A'm t'ink mebbe-so you
better com' 'long wit' me."

"Come along with you!  What's on yer mind?"  Suddenly the man
straightened: "Say, look a here, if you're up to helpin' Tex Benton
pull off any gag on me, you've picked the wrong hand, see!"

The other shook his head vigorously: "_Non_!  Tex, she goin' in de
dance-hall.  She don' know nuthin' 'bout w'at A'm know."

"What you drivin' at?  Come on, spit 'er out!  I hain't a-goin' to fool
'round here all night an' miss the dancin'."

Bat stepped closer: "Two mans an' wan 'oman gon' up de trail.  A'm
t'ink som'one goin' for git keel.  Mebbe-so we better gon' up an' see
'bout dat."

"You're crazy as hell!  The trail's free, hain't it?  What business I
got hornin' in on 'em?  I come to town for to take in the dance, an'
I'm a-goin' to.  Besides it's a good chanct to do a little
'lectioneerin'."  Once more Bat shrugged, and turning away, began to
untie his horse.

"Four Ace Johnson, over 'crost de riv', she dipity sher'ff, too.  A'm
hear she goin' run for de beeg sher'ff, nex' fall.  A'm gon' over an'
see if she no lak' to go 'long an' mak' de arres' if som'ting happen.
Mebbe-so w'en de votin' tam' com' 'long de men lak' for hav' Choteau
County sher'ff w'at kin mak' de arres' better as de sher'ff w'at kin
dance good.  _Voila_!"  Without so much as a glance toward the other,
he slipped into his saddle and started slowly down the alley.  Before
he reached the street Moore's horse pushed up beside him.

"Where's this here outfit?" he growled, with a glance toward the
dance-hall lights, "an' what makes you think they's a-goin' to be
gun-fightin'?"

"A'm t'ink dey ain' so far," replied the half-breed as he swung into
the trail at a trot.  And although the impatient deputy plied him with
a volley of questions the other vouchsafed no further information.
Midway of the ascent to the bench the two drew rein abruptly.  From
above, and at no great distance, rang the sound of a shot--then
silence.  The deputy glanced at the half-breed: "Hey, Bat," he
whispered, "this here's a dangerous business!"

"Mebbe-so Choteau County lak' to git de sher'ff w'at ain' so mooch
scairt."

"Scairt!  Who's scairt?  It hain't that.  But I got a wife an' nine
kids back there in the mountains, an' I'm a-goin' to deputize you."

The half-breed shot him a look of sudden alarm: "_Non_!  _Non_!  Better
I lak' I ponch de cattle.  You ke'p de nine wife an' de kid!"

"You hain't got no more sense than a reservation Injun!" growled the
deputy.  "What I mean is, you got to help me make this here arrest!"

The half-breed grinned broadly: "Me,--A'm de, w'at you call, de posse,
eh?  _Bien_!  Com' on 'long den.  Mebbe-so we no ketch, you no git
'lect for sher'ff."

At the head of the trail the deputy checked his galloping mount with a
jerk and scrutinized the three riderless horses that stood huddled
together.  His face paled perceptibly.  "Oh, Lord!" he gasped between
stiffening lips: "It's Tex, an' Jack Purdy, an' they've fit over
Cinnabar Joe's gal!"

He turned wrathfully toward Bat.  "Why'n you tell me who it was up
here, so's I could a gathered a man's-size posse?" he demanded.
"Whichever one of them two has shot up the other, they hain't goin' to
be took in none peaceable.  An' if they've killed one of each other
a'ready, he ain't goin' to be none scrupulous about pottin' you an' me.
Chances is, they've got us covered right now.  'Tain't noways
percautious to go ahead--an' we don't dast to go back!  Bat, this is a
hell of a place to be--an' it's your fault.  Mebbe they won't shoot a
unarmed man--here Bat, you take my gun an' go ahead.  I'll tell 'em
back there how you was game to the last.  O-O-o-o-o!  I got a turrible
cramp in my stummick!  I got to lay down.  Do your duty, Bat, an' if I
surmise this here attact, which I think it's the appendeetus, I'll tell
'em how you died with yer boots on in the service of yer country."  The
man forced his six-shooter into the half-breed's hand and, slipping
limply from his saddle to the ground, wriggled swiftly into the shadow
of a sage bush.

Bat moved his horse slowly forward as he peered about him.  "If Purdy
keel de pilgrim, den A'm better look out.  He don' lak' me nohow,
'cause A'm fin' out 'bout dat cinch.  Better A'm lak' Sam Moore, A'm
git de 'pendeceet in my belly for li'l w'ile."  He swung off his horse
and flattening himself against the ground, advanced cautiously from
bush to bush.  At the edge of the depression he paused and stared at
the two figures that huddled close together a few feet ahead.  Both
were gazing toward the trail and in the moonlight he recognized the
face of the pilgrim.  With a smile of satisfaction the half-breed stood
erect and advanced boldly.

"You com' in tam', eh?" he asked, as with a nod Endicott stepped toward
him and handed him the revolver.

"Yes, just in time.  I am deeply grateful to you."

"Eh?"  The other's brows drew together.

"I say, I thank you--for the gun, and for telling me----"

"Ha, dat's a'right.  W'er' Purdy?"  The girl shuddered, as Endicott
pointed to the ground at some little distance away.  The man advanced
and bent over the prostrate form.

"Ba goss!" he exclaimed with a glance of admiration.  "You shoot heem
after de draw!  _Nom de Dieu_!  You good man wit' de gun!  Wer' you hit
heem?"

Endicott shook his head.  "I don't know.  I saw him, and shot, and he
fell."  The half-breed was bending over the man on the ground.

"You shoot heem on he's head," he approved, "dat pret' good place."  He
bent lower and a sibilant sound reached the ears of Endicott and the
girl.  After a moment the man stood up and came toward them smiling.
"A'm fin' out if she dead," he explained, casually.  "A'm speet de
tobac' juice in he's eye.  If she wink she ain' dead.  Purdy, she don'
wink no mor'.  Dat damn good t'ing."

Again Alice Marcum shuddered as Endicott spoke: "Can you find our
horses?" he asked.  "I must go to town and give myself up."

"_Oui_, A'm git de hoss' a'right.  Better you tak' 'em an' skeep off.
A'm git on dat posse an' you bet we no ketch.  A'm lak' you fine."

"No!  No!" Endicott exclaimed.  "If I have killed a man I shall stand
trial for it.  I won't sneak away like a common murderer.  I know my
act was no crime, let the decision of the jury be what it may."

The half-breed regarded him with a puzzled frown.  "You mean you lak'
fer git arres'?" he asked in surprise.

"Why, of course!  I--" the other interrupted with a laugh.

"A'right.  Dat de kin' Sam Moore she lak' fer arres'.  Sam, she layin'
back here a ways.  She dipity sher'ff, an' we'n we com' on dem hoss',
Sam she git to fink 'bout he's wife an' kids.  He don' fink 'bout dem
mooch only w'en he git dronk, or git scairt.  Den he lov' 'em lak'
hell, an' he grab de beeg belly-ache, so dey don' got for feel sorry
'bout heem gittin' keel."

Slipping his own gun into its holster, the half-breed turned and walked
toward the spot where he had left the deputy, and as he walked he threw
open the cylinder of the officer's gun and removed the cartridges.

"Sam!" he called sharply.  Cautiously a head raised from behind a sage
bush.  "How long you t'ink dat tak' you git well?  Wan man he lak' for
git arres' w'en you git time."

"Shut up!  Don't talk so loud!  D'you want to git us killed?  Which one
got it?"

"Purdy.  De pilgrim shoot heem 'cause he run off wit' he's girl."

"Pilgrim!  What pilgrim!  An' what girl?  Ain't that Tex Benton's
horse, an' Cinnabar Joe's----?"

"Uh-huh, A'm bor' heem Tex boss for ketch Purdy.  An', Ba goss, he
shoot heem on he's head after Purdy draw'd!"

Moore stared aghast.  "What?  A pilgrim done that?  Not on yer life!
He may look an' act like a pilgrim but, take it from me, he's a
desperate character if he got Purdy after he draw'd.  It's worser than
if it was Tex.  _He_ might of took pity on us, knowin' about the
fambly.  But a stranger, an' one that kin git a man like Jack Purdy!
O-o-o-o, my stummick!  Bat, I'm 'fraid I'm a-passin' away!  These
spells is a-killin' me--an' what'll become of the woman an' the kids?"

The half-breed grinned: "Mebbe-so you kin' pass back agin, Sam.  He
ain' got no gun."

Sam Moore ceased to writhe, and sat abruptly erect.  "Ain't got no
gun!" he exclaimed.  "What did he shoot Purdy with?"

"My gun.  He giv' it back to me.  A'm bor' heem dat gun li'l while ago."

The deputy sprang to his feet.  "Quick, now, Bat!" he roared loudly.
"You slip these irons on him, an' I'll catch up the horses.  Don't take
no chances!"  He tossed the half-breed a pair of hand-cuffs, and
started after his own horse.  "Kill him if he makes a crooked move.
Tell him you're actin' under my authority an' let him understand we're
hard men to tamper with--us sheriffs.  We don't stand fer no foolin'."


In Curly Hardee's dance-hall Tex Benton leaned against the wall and
idly watched the couples weave in and out upon the floor to the whining
accompaniment of the fiddles and the clanging piano.

Apparently the cowboy's interest centred solely upon the dancers, but a
close observer would have noticed the keen glance with which he scanned
each new arrival--noticed too, that after a few short puffs on a
cigarette the man tossed it to the floor and immediately rolled
another, which is not in the manner of a man with a mind at ease.

The Texan saw Endicott enter the room, watched as the man's eyes swept
the faces of dancers and spectators, and smiled as he turned toward the
door.

"Three of us," mused the cowboy, with the peculiar smile still twisting
the corners of his lips, "Purdy, an' me, an' the pilgrim.  Purdy's
work's so coarse he'll gum his own game, an' that's where I come in.
An' the pilgrim--I ain't quite figgered how he stacks up."  The
cowpuncher glanced at his watch.  "It's time they showed up long ago.
I wonder what's keepin' em."  Suddenly he straightened himself with a
jerk: "Good Lord!  I wonder if----  But no, not even Purdy would try
_that_.  Still, if he knows I know he tried to dope me he'll be
figgerin' on pullin' his freight anyhow, an'--"  The man's lips
tightened and, elbowing his way to the door he stepped onto the street
and hurried to the Headquarters saloon.  Cinnabar Joe was behind the
bar, apparently none the worse for his dose of chloral, and in answer
to a swift signal, followed the Texan to the rear of the room.

"Does Purdy know I'm wise to his dope game?"

The bartender nodded: "Yes, I told him you must of switched the
glasses."

"I saw him leadin' your horse rigged up with your side-saddle acrost
the flats awhile back."

Again the bartender nodded: "He borrowed the outfit fer a gal of his'n
he said come in on the train.  Wanted to take her fer a ride."

"Where'd they go?"  The words whipped viciously.

"Search me!  I've had my hands full to keep track of what's goin' on in
here, let alone outside."

Without a word the Texan stepped out the back door and hastened toward
the horse corral behind the livery stable.  Circling its fence to the
head of the alley, he stared in surprise at the spot where he and Bat
Lajune had tied their horses.  The animals were gone, and cursing the
half-breed at every step, he rushed to the street, and catching up the
reins of a big roan that stood in a group of horses, swung into the
saddle and headed out onto the trail.

"Women are fools," he muttered savagely.  "It beats hell what even the
sensible ones will fall for!"

At the up-bend of the trail he halted abruptly and listened.  From the
shadows of the coulee ahead came the sound of voices and the soft
scraping of horses' feet.  He drew the roan into a cottonwood thicket
and waited.

"Somethin' funny here.  Nobody ever come to a dance ridin' at a walk,"
he muttered, and then as the little cavalcade broke into the bright
moonlight at a bend of the trail, his eyes widened with surprise.  In
front rode Bat Lajune with Purdy's horse snubbed to his saddle-horn,
and immediately following him were the girl and Endicott riding side by
side.  Tex saw that the girl was crying, and that Endicott's hands were
manacled, and that he rode the missing horse.  Behind them rode Sam
Moore, pompously erect, a six-shooter laid across the horn of his
saddle, and a scowl of conceited importance upon his face that would
have evoked the envy of the Kaiser of Krautland.  The figure appealed
to the Texan's sense of humour and waiting until the deputy was exactly
opposite his place of concealment, he filled his lungs and leaned
forward in his saddle.

"Y-e-e-e-o-w!"  The sound blared out like the shrill of doom.  The
officer's six-shooter thudded upon the ground, his hands grasped the
horn of the saddle, his spurs dug into his horse's flanks and sent the
animal crashing between the girl and Endicott and caused Purdy's horse
to tear loose from the half-breed's saddle-horn.

"Stand 'em off, Bat!" shrieked the deputy as he shot past, "I'm a-goin'
fer help!" and away he tore, leaning far over his horse's neck, with
Purdy's horse, the stirrups lashing his sides, dashing madly in his
wake.

A moment later Tex pushed his mount into the trail where the girl,
drawn close to Endicott, waited in fearful expectation.  The half-breed
met him with a grin.

Rapidly, with many ejaculations interspersing explosive volleys of
half-intelligible words, Bat acquainted the Texan with the progress of
events.  The cowpuncher listened without comment until the other had
finished.   Then he turned to Endicott.

"Where'd you learn to shoot?" he asked abruptly.

"I never learned.  Until tonight I never had a pistol in my hand."

"You done damned well--to start out with," commented the Texan dryly.

"But, oh, it's horrible!" sobbed the girl, "and it's all my fault!"

"I reckon that's right.  It looks like a bad mix-up all around."

"Oh, why didn't you tell me what a _beast_ he was?  You knew all the
time.  And when you insulted him I thought you were _horrid_!  And I
thought he was so noble when he refrained from shooting you."

"No.  He wasn't noble, none noticeable--Purdy wasn't.  An' as for me
tellin' you about him--answer me square: Would you have believed me?"

The girl's eyes fell before his steady gaze.

"No," she faltered, "I wouldn't.  But isn't there something we can do?
Some way out of this awful mess?"

The Texan's eyes flashed a glint of daring.  He was thinking rapidly.
Endicott moved his horse closer to the cowboy.  "Can't you manage to
get _her_ away--onto a train some place so she can avoid the annoyance
of having to testify at the trial, and submit to the insulting remarks
of your sheriff?"

The girl interrupted him: "Winthrop Adams Endicott, if you dare to even
think _such_ a thing--I'll never speak to you again!  Indeed he _won't_
take me away or put me on any train!  I got you into this, and I won't
budge one inch until you get out of it.  What do I care for a little
annoyance--and as for the sheriff, I'll say 'boo' at him in the dark
and he'll die."

There was a gleam of approval in the eyes of the Texan as his lips
twisted into their peculiar cynical smile.  "Spunky little devil," he
thought to himself.  "There's a chance to pull a play here somewhere
that'll make me solid with her all right.  I got to have time to
think."  Aloud he said: "Just you leave things to me.  I'll get a line
on what's what.  But you both got to do as I say, an' no augerin' about
it neither.  It looks from here as if things could be straightened out
if someone don't go to work an' ball the jack.  An' as for Sam passin'
insultin' remarks no more--he won't.  Here he comes now with about half
Wolf River for a posse."  The cowboy turned to Endicott: "You go 'long
with 'em an' lay low 'til you hear from Bat, there, or me.  Then you do
as we say, an' don't ask no questions."

The rumble of horses' feet sounded from the direction of the little
town and the Texan whispered to Bat: "Find out where they lock him up.
An' when the excitement dies down you find me.  I ain't a-goin' to lose
sight of _her_--see."  The half-breed grinned his understanding and Tex
swung his horse in close beside the girl and awaited the coming of the
posse.

With a yell the onrushing cowboys whom the deputy had recruited from
the dance-hall spied the little group and, thundering up at full
gallop, formed a closely packed circle about them.  Recognizing the
deputy who was vociferously urging his horse from the rear, Tex forced
his way through the circle and called him aside.

"Say, Sam," he drawled, in a tone that caused the deputy's hair to
prickle at its roots; "about some an' sundry insultin' remarks you
passed agin' the lady, yonder----"

"No, I never----"

"That'll be about all the lyin' you need to do now.  An' just let this
sink in.  You can lock up the pilgrim where you damn please.  But the
lady goes to the hotel.  If you aim to hold her as a witness you can
appoint a guard--an' I'm the guard.  D'you get me?  'Cause if there's
any misunderstandin' lingerin' in them scrambled aigs you use fer
brains, I'll just start out by tellin' the boys what a hell of a brave
arrest you pulled off, an' about the nervy stand you made agin' odds to
guard your prisoners when I yipped at you from the brush.  Then, after
they get through havin' their fun out of you, I'll just waste a shell
on you for luck--see?"

"Sure, Tex, that sounds reasonable," the other rattled on in evident
relief.  "Fact is, I be'n huntin' fer you ever sense I suspicioned
they'd be'n a murder.  'If I c'd only find Tex,' I says to myself, I
says, 'he'd be worth a hull posse hisself.'  Jest you go ahead an'
night-herd the lady.  I'll tell her myself so's it'll be official.  An'
me an' the rest of the boys here, we'll take care of the pilgrim, which
he ain't no pilgrim at all, but a desperate desperado, or he couldn't
never have got Jack Purdy the way he done."

The Texan grinned and, forcing his horse through the crowd, reached the
girl's side where he was joined a few moments later by the deputy.
Despite her embarrassing situation Alice Marcum could scarce restrain a
smile at the officer's sudden obsequious deference.  Stetson in hand,
he bowed awkwardly.  "Excuse me, mom, but, as I was goin' on to say in
reference of any remarks I might of passed previous, I found out
subsequent I didn't mean what I was sayin', which I misunderstood
myself complete.  But as I was goin' on to say, mom, the State of
Montany might need you fer a witness in this here felonious trial, so
if you'll be so kind an' go to the _ho_tel along of Tex here whom he's
the party I've tolled off fer to guard you, an' don't stand no monkey
business neither.  What I mean is," he hastened to add, catching a
glance from the Texan's eye, "don't be afraid to ask fer soap or towels
if there hain't none in yer room, an' if yer cold holler fer an extry
blanket er two.  The State's a-payin' fer it, an' yer board, too, an'
if they don't fill you up every meal you set up a yell an' I'll see 't
they do."  The deputy turned abruptly away and addressed the cowboys:
"Come on, boys, let's git this character under lock an' key so I kin
breathe easier."

Even Endicott joined in the laugh that greeted the man's words and,
detaining a cowpuncher to ride on either side of the prisoner, the
officer solemnly led the way toward town.


CHAPTER VIII

ONE WAY OUT

As the horses traversed the two miles of winding trail, Alice Marcum
glanced from time to time at the Texan who rode silently at her side.
The man's face was grave and he seemed entirely oblivious to her
presence.  Only once did she venture to speak to him.

"I suppose I ought to thank you, Mr.----"

"Tex'll do," supplied the man, without even the courtesy of a glance.

"--for the very changed attitude of the sheriff, and for the fact that
I am to be lodged in the hotel instead of the jail."

The girl thought the Texan's lips drew into their peculiar smile, but
he gave no further evidence of having heard and rode on in silence,
with his attention apparently fixed upon the tips of his horse's ears.
At the edge of town the crowd, with Endicott in its midst, swerved
toward the railroad and the girl found herself alone with her jailer.
She drew up her horse sharply and glanced back toward the prisoner.

"This way," said a voice close beside her; "we'll go to the hotel, I
guess there's enough of 'em to see that the pilgrim gets locked up
safe."

"But I--I want to speak to him.  To tell him----"

"Never mind what you want to tell him.  It'll keep, I reckon."

At the door of the wooden hotel the cowpuncher swung from his horse.
"You wait here a minute; I'll go fetch Jennie.  She's prob'ly over to
the dance.  She'll fix you up with a room an' see that you get what you
want."

"But my bag?"

"Yer what?"

"My bag--with all my things in it.  I left it in the car."

"Oh, yer war-bag!  All right, I'll get that after I've got Jennie cut
out an' headed this way."

He stepped into the dance-hall next door and motioned to a plump,
round-faced girl who was dancing with a young cowboy.  At the
conclusion of the dance the girl laughingly refused to accompany her
partner to the bar, and made her way toward the Texan.

"Say, Jennie," the man said, after drawing her aside; "there's a girl
over to the hotel and I want you to go over an' fix her up with a room.
Give her Number 11.  It's handy to the side door."

The girl's nose went up and the laughing eyes flashed scornfully.  "No,
you don't, Tex Benton!  What do you think I am?  An' what's more, you
don't pull nothin' like that around there.  That hotel's run decent,
an' it's goin' to stay decent or Hank can get someone else fer help.
They's some several of the boys has tried it sence I be'n there but
they never tried it but onct.  _An' that goes_!"  The girl turned away
with a contemptuous sniff.

"Jennie!" The Texan was smiling.  "This is a little different case, I
reckon."

"They're all different cases," she retorted.  "But everything's be'n
tried from a sister come on a unexpected visit, to slippin' me
five--Cinnabar Joe tended to that one's case hisself, an' he done a
good job, too.  So you might's well save yer wind 'cause there ain't
nothin' you can think up to say that'll fool me a little bit.  I ain't
worked around hotels fer it's goin' on six years fer nothin', an' I
wouldn't trust no man--cowboys an' drummers least of all."

"Listen, Jennie, I ain't tryin' to tell you I wouldn't.  Only this
time, I ain't.  If I was, don't you suppose I've got sense enough not
to go to you to help me with it?"  The girl waited with all outward
appearance of skepticism for him to proceed.  "This girl went ridin'
with Jack Purdy--he borrowed the side-saddle from Cinnabar----"

"Did Cinnabar loan him that saddle fer any such----?"

"Hold on, now, Cinnabar don't know nothin' about it.  Purdy wants to
borrow his side-saddle an' Joe says sure."

"He might of know'd if Purdy wanted it, it wasn't fer no good.  You're
all bad enough, goodness knows, but he was the worst of the lot.  I
hate Purdy an' you bet he cuts a big circle when he sees me comin'."

"Well, he won't no more," answered the Texan dryly.  "Purdy's dead."

"Dead!"

"Yes.  He took a pilgrim's girl out on the bench an' the pilgrim got
wise to it an' dug out after 'em.  Got there just in time an' took a
shot at Purdy an' got him."

"Land sakes!  I'm glad he did!  If they was a few more pilgrims like
him that would get about half the rest of you, maybe the others would
turn decent, or take to the brush."

The Texan laughed.  "Anyway Purdy's dead, an' they've got the pilgrim
locked up, an' the girl's held fer a witness, an' I told Sam Moore I'd
take a shot at him if he locked her up wherever he's goin' to lock up
the pilgrim--in the wool-warehouse I reckon.  Anyhow, he told her to go
to the hotel an' specified me fer a guard."

"Oh, he did, did he?  Well jest you wait 'til I get my hat.  I guess
maybe she'll be safer with _two_ guards."  With a meaning look the girl
hurried away and a moment later returned and followed the Texan from
the room.

"Why was you so anxious she was to have Number 11, if what you've told
me is on the level?" she asked, as they approached the hotel.

"I don't know, yet, exactly.  But I've got a hunch they'll be somethin'
doin' a little later."

"Uh-huh, an' I'll be right there when it's doin', too.  An' you can bet
your last blue one on that!"

Alice Marcum swung unassisted to the ground as the two approached.  And
as she glanced into the wide, friendly eyes of the girl she felt deeply
grateful to the Texan for bringing a woman.  Then the woman was
speaking: "Come right along in the house.  I'm Jennie Dodds, an' I'll
see't you get settled comfortable.  Tex, he told me all about it.  Land
sakes!  I bet you feel proud!  Who'd a thought any pilgrim could a got
Jack Purdy!  Where's your grip?"

"Gosh!  I plumb forgot!" exclaimed the cowboy, and started for his
horse.  "I'll be back with yer war-bag in a minute."  A few moments
later, he returned to the hotel carrying a leather bag.

"I'm goin' to kind of slip around among the boys a bit.  I've be'n
doin' some thinkin' an maybe we can figger a way out.  I don't quite
like the way things is shapin' up.  I'll be wantin' most likely to see
you in a while----"

"We'll both be here," interrupted Jennie.  "_Both_ of us.  We'll be in
Number 11."

Outside the hotel the Texan paused to roll and light a cigarette, and
as he blew the smoke from his lungs, he smiled cynically.

"Purdy's work was so damn coarse he got just what was comin' to him.
There's only me an' the pilgrim, now--an' it's me an' him for it.  I
ain't plumb got the girl sized up yet.  If she's straight--all right.
She'll stay straight.  If she ain't----  They say everything's fair in
love an' war, an' bein' as it's my deal the pilgrim's got to go up
against a stacked deck.  An' if things works out right, believe me,
he's a-goin' to know he's be'n somewhere by the time he gets back--if
he ever does get back."

For the third time that evening he entered the dance-hall and avoiding
the dancers made his way leisurely toward the bar that ran along one
side of the room.

"Hello, Tex, ain't dancin'?  Say, they're tellin' how a pilgrim killed
Jack Purdy.  Yes, an' they got him locked up down in the
wool-warehouse.  What's yourn?"  The cowboy ranged himself beside the
Texan.

"A little red liquor, I reckon."  The men poured their drinks and the
Texan glanced toward the other: "You ain't mournin' none over Purdy,
Curly?"

"Who, me?" the man laughed.  "Not what you c'd notice, I ain't.  An'
they's plenty others ain't, too.  I don't hear no lamentations wailin'
a-bustin' in on the festchivities.  It was over the pilgrim's girl.
They say how Purdy tried to----"

"Yes, he did.  But the pilgrim got there first.  I been thinkin',
Curly.  It's plumb shameful for to hold the pilgrim for doin' what one
of us would of had to do sooner or later.  Choteau County has stood for
him about as long as it could, an' a damn sight longer than it ought
to.  His work was gettin' so rotten it stunk, I could tell you about a
sage-brush corral an' some runnin'-iron work over on the south
slope----"

"Yes," broke in the other, "an' there's a hell of a lot of I X an' Bear
Paw Pool cows that show'd up, brandin' time, 'thout no calves."

The Texan nodded: "Exactly.  Now, what I was goin' on to say: The grand
jury don't set for a couple or three months yet.  An' when they do,
they'll turn the pilgrim loose so quick it'll make yer head swim.
Then, there's the girl.  They'll hold her for a witness--not that
they'd have to, 'cause she'll stay on her own hook.  Now what's the use
of them bein' took down to Benton an' stuck in jail?  Drink up, an'
have another."

"Not none," agreed Curly, as he measured out his liquor to an imaginary
line half-way up the glass.  "But how'd you figger to fix it?"

"Well," answered the Texan, as his lips twisted into their peculiar
smile; "we might get the right bunch together an' go down to the
wool-warehouse an' save the grand jury the trouble."

The other stared at him in amazement: "You mean bust him out?"

Tex laughed: "Sure.  Lord!  Won't it be fun seein' Sam Moore puttin' up
a scrap to save his prisoner?"

"But, how'd we git away with him?  All Sam w'd do is git a posse an'
take out after him an' they'd round him up 'fore he got to Three-mile.
Or if we went along we'd git further but they'd git us in the end an'
then we'd be in a hell of a fix!"

"Your head don't hurt you none, workin' it that way, does it?" grinned
Tex.  "I done thought it all out.  We'll get the boys an' slip down to
the warehouse an' take the pilgrim out an' slip a noose around his neck
an' set him on a horse an' ride out of town a-cussin' him an'
a-swearin' to lynch him.  He won't know but what we aim to hang him to
the first likely cottonwood, an' we'll have a lot of fun with him.  An'
no one else won't know it, neither.  Then you-all ride back an' pertend
to keep mum, but leak it out that we done hung him.  They won't be no
posse hunt for him then an' I'll take him an' slip him acrost to the N.
P. or the C. P. R. an' let him go.  It's too good a chanct to miss.
Lordy!  Won't the pilgrim beg!  An' Sam Moore--he'll be scairt out of a
year's growth!"

"But, the girl," objected Curly.

"Oh, the girl--well, they'll turn her loose, of course.  They ain't
nothin' on her except for a witness.  An' if they ain't no prisoner
they won't need no witness, will they?"

"That's right," assented the other.  "By gosh, Tex, what you can't
think up, the devil wouldn't bother with.  That's sure some stunt.
Let's get the boys an' go to it!"

"You get the boys together.  Get about twenty of the live ones an' head
'em over to the Headquarters.  I'll go hunt up a horse for the pilgrim
an' be over there in half an hour."

Curly passed from man to man, whom he singled out from among the
dancers and onlookers, and the Texan slipped unobserved through the
door and proceeded directly to the hotel.  On the street he met Bat.

"De pilgrim, she lock up in de woolhouse an' Sam Moore she stan' 'long
de door wit two revolver an' wan big rifle."

"All right, Bat.  You look alive now, an' catch up Purdy's horse an'
see that you get a good set of bridle reins on him, an' find the girl's
horse an' get holt of a pack-horse somewheres an' get your war-bag an'
mine an' our blankets onto him, an' go down to the store an' get a
couple more pairs of blankets, an' grub enough fer a week for four, an'
get that onto him, an' have all them horses around to the side door of
the hotel in twenty minutes, or I'll bust you wide open an' fill your
hide with prickly pears."

The half-breed nodded his understanding and slipped onto his horse as
the Texan entered the hotel.  Passing through the office where a
coal-oil lamp burned dimly in a wall-bracket, he stepped into the
narrow hallway and paused with his eyes on the bar of yellow light that
showed at the bottom of the door of Number 11.

"Most any fool thing would do to tell the girl.  But I've got to make
it some plausible to put it acrost on Jennie.  I'm afraid I kind of
over-played my hand a little when I let her in on this, but--damn it!
I felt kind of sorry for the girl even if it was her own fool fault
gettin' into this jack-pot.  I thought maybe a woman could kind of
knock off the rough edges a little.  Well, here goes!"  He knocked
sharply, and it was a very grave-faced cowboy who stepped into the room
and closed the door behind him.  "I've be'n doin' quite some feelin'
out of the public pulse, as the feller says, an' the way things looks
from here, the pilgrim is sure in bad.  You see, the jury is bound to
be made up of cow-men an' ranchers with a sheep-man or two mixed in.
An' they're all denizens that Choteau County is infested with.  Now a
stranger comin' in that way an' kind of pickin' one of us off, casual,
like a tick off'n a dog's ear, it won't be looked on with favour----"

Jennie interrupted, with a belligerent forefinger wagging almost
against the Texan's nose: "But that Jack Purdy needed killin' if ever
any one did.  He was loose an'----"

"Yes," broke in Tex, "he was.  I ain't here to pronounce no benediction
of blessedness on Purdy's remains.  But, you got to recollect that most
of the jury, picked out at random, is in the same boat--loose, an'
needin' killin', which they know as well as you an' me do, an'
consequent ain't a-goin' to establish no oncomfortable precedent.
Suppose any pilgrim was allowed to step off'n a train any time he
happened to be comin' through, an' pick off a loose one?  What would
Choteau County's or any other county's he-population look like in a
year's time, eh?  It would look like the hair-brush out here in the
wash-room, an' you could send in the votin' list on a cigarette paper.
No, sir, the pilgrim ain't got a show if he's got to face a jury.
There's only one way out, an' there's about fifteen or twenty of the
boys that's willin' to give him a chance.  We're a-goin' to bust him
out of jail an' put him on a horse an' run him up some cottonwood
coulee with a rope around his neck."

Alice Marcum, who had followed every word, turned chalk-white in the
lamplight as she stared wide-eyed at the Texan, with fingers pressed
tight against her lips, while Jennie placed herself protectingly
between them and launched into a perfect tirade.

"Hold on, now."  Both girls saw that the man was smiling and Jennie
relapsed into a warlike silence.  "A rope necktie ain't a-goin' to hurt
no one as long as he keeps his heft off'n it.  As I was goin' on to
say, we'll run him up this coulee an' a while later the boys'll ride
back to town in the same semmey-serious mood that accompanies such
similar enterprises.  They won't do no talkin' an' they won't need to.
Folks will naturally know that justice has be'n properly dispensed
with, an' that their taxes won't raise none owin' to county funds bein'
misdirected in prosecutin' a public benefactor--an' they'll be
satisfied.  The preacher'll preach a long sermon condemnin' the takin'
of human life without due process of law, an' the next Sunday he'll
preach another one about the onchristian shootin' of folks without
givin' 'em a chanct to repent--after they'd drawed--an' he'll use the
lynchin' as a specimen of the workin's of the hand of the Lord in
bringin' speedy justice onto the murderer.

"But they ain't be'n no lynchin' done.  'Cause the boys will turn the
prisoner over to me an' I'll hustle him acrost to the N. P. an' let him
get out of the country."

Alice Marcum leaped to her feet: "Oh, are you telling me the truth?
How do I know you're not going to lynch him?  I told him I'd stay with
him and see him through!"

The Texan regarded her gravely: "You can," he said after a moment of
silence.  "I'll have Bat take you to Snake Creek crossing an' you can
wait there 'til I come along with the pilgrim.  Then we'll cut through
the mountains an' hit down through the bad lands an'----"

"No you don't, Tex Benton!"  Jennie was facing him again.  "You're a
smooth one all right.  How long would it take you to lose the pilgrim
there in the bad lands, even if you don't lynch him, which it ain't no
cinch you ain't a-goin' to--then where would _she_ be?  No, sir, you
don't pull nothin' like that off on me!"

"But I want to go!" cried Alice.  "I want to be near him, and I'm not
afraid."

The girl regarded her for a moment in silence.  "I should think you'd
had enough of cowpunchers for one night.  But if you're bound to go I
ain't got no right to hold you.  I'd go along with you if I could, but
I can't."

"I'm not afraid," she answered as her eyes sought the Texan's.  "I've
learned a lot in the past few hours."

"I guess you ain't learnt enough to hurt you none," retorted Jennie,
with a trace of acid in her tone.  "An' you'll learn a lot more 'fore
you hit the N. P., or my name ain't Jennie Dodds.  If you're bound to
go you can take my outfit.  I guess Tex'll see that my horse comes
back, anyhow."

The cowpuncher grinned: "Thanks, Jennie, I'm right proud to know you
think I wouldn't steal your horse."  Once more he turned to the girl.
"When the half-breed comes for you, you go with him.  I've got to go on
with the boys, now."  Abruptly he left the room, and once more paused
in the hall before passing through the office.  "She's game, all right.
An' the way she can look at a fellow out of those eyes of hers----  By
God!  Purdy _ought_ to be'n killed!"


CHAPTER IX

THE PILGRIM

A group of saddle-horses stood before the Headquarters saloon, and as
the Texan entered he was vociferously greeted by the twenty cowboys who
crowded the bar.

"Come on, Tex, drink up!"

"Hell'll be a-poppin' down to the wool-warehouse."

"An', time we get there we won't be able to see Sam Moore fer dust."
Curly raised his glass and the cowpunchers joined in uproarious song:

  "We'll string him up to a cottonwood limb
  An' dig his grave in under him,
  We'll tromp down the clods, an' we won't give a damn
  'Cause he'll never kill another cow-man,
  Ah wi yi yippie i oo-o-!"

Without a break the Texan picked up the refrain, improvising words to
fit the occasion:

  "The sheriff's name, it's old Sam Moore,
  He's standin' down by the jail-house door
  With seventeen knives an' a gatlin' gun,
  But you bet your boots we'll make him run
  Ah wi yi yippie i o-o-o-!"

With whoops of approbation and a deafening chorus of yowls and
catcalls, the cowpunchers crowded through the door.  A moment later the
bar-room was deserted and out in the street the night air resounded
with the sound of snorting, trampling horses, the metallic jangle of
spurs and bit chains, the creak of saddle-leather, and the terse,
quick-worded observations of men mounting in the midst of the confusion
of refractory horses.

"The sheriff's name, it's old Sam Moore!" roared a cowboy as he slammed
into the saddle of a skew-ball black.

"Go git him!" howled another in exact imitation of Slim Maloney.

There was a thunder of hoofs as the whole crowd, headed by Tex and
Curly swept down the street and across the flat toward the impromptu
jail.

With a lighted lantern beside him, Sam Moore sat upon the strongly
built unloading platform before the warehouse door, access to which was
gained by means of a flight of six or eight plank steps at either end.
Up these steps rode a couple of cowpunchers while the rest drew up
sharply at the very edge of the platform.  Hemmed in upon all sides the
valiant deputy glanced fearfully into the faces of the horsemen.
"Wha--What's up, boys?  What's ailin' ye?" he managed to blurt out.

"Drop them guns an' give over the key!" commanded someone.

"Sure--sure, boys!  I hain't aimin' to hurt no one.  Yer all friends of
mine an' what you say goes with me."

"Friends of yourn!" roared someone menacingly; "you're a liar, Sam!
You ain't never seen nary one of us before!  Git that!"

"Sure, sure thing, boys, I don't know who ye be.  'Tain't none of my
business.  I couldn't name none of you.  You don't need to be scairt of
me."

"You beat it, then, an' lose yerself an' don't yer go stirrin' up no
rookus over to the dance, er we'll dangle you a little, too."

"Sure.  I'm a-goin' now.  I----"

"Fork over that key first!"

"Sure, Tex!  Here it is----"

"Sure _who_!" rasped a voice close to the sheriff's ear.

"I mean--I said----  Here's the doggone key!  I was thinkin' of a
feller I know'd down to Wyomin'.  Tex--Tex--Smith, er some such of a
name it was.  I mistrusted you was him, an' mebbe you be fer all I
know.  I don't savvy none of you whatever."

"Get a move on, Sam!"

"Me!  I'm gone!  An' you boys remember when 'lection time comes, to
vote fer a sheriff that's got disgression an' common sense."  And with
ludicrous alacrity, the deputy scrambled from the platform and
disappeared into the deep blackness of the lumber-yard.

The Texan fitted the key into the huge padlock and a moment later the
door swung open and a dozen cowpunchers swarmed in.

"Come on, pilgrim, an' try on yer necktie!"

"We'll prob'ly have to haul down all them wool-sacks an' drag him out
from behind 'em."

"I think not.  If I am the man you want I think you will find me
perfectly able to walk."  The pilgrim stood leaning against one of the
wooden supporting posts, and as a cowboy thrust the lantern into his
face he noted the eyes never faltered.

"Come along with us!" commanded the puncher, gruffly, as another
stepped up and slipped the noose of a lariat-rope over his head.

"So I am to be lynched, am I?" asked the pilgrim in a matter-of-fact
tone, as with a cowboy on either side he was hurried across the
platform and onto a horse.

"This ain't no time to talk," growled another.  "We'll give you a
chanct to empty yer chest 'fore we string you up."

In the moonlight the prisoner's face showed very pale, but the cow-men
saw that his lips were firmly set, and the hands that caught up the
bridle reins did not falter.  As the cavalcade started out upon the
trail the Texan turned back, and riding swiftly to the hotel, found Bat
waiting.

"You go in to Number 11 and tell the girl you're ready to start."

"You'm mean de pilgrim's girl?"

The Texan frowned and swore under his breath: "She ain't the pilgrim's
girl, yet--by a damn sight!  You take her an' the pack horse an' hit
down the river an' cut up through old man Lee's horse ranch onto the
bench.  Then hit for Snake Creek crossin' an' wait for me."

The half-breed nodded, and the Texan's frown deepened as he leaned
closer.  "An' you see that you get her through safe an' sound or I'll
cut off them ears of yours an' stake you out in a rattlesnake den to
think it over."  The man grinned and the frown faded from the Texan's
face.  "You got to do me a good turn, Bat.  Remember them four bits in
Las Vegas!"

"A'm tak' de girl to Snake Creek crossin' a'right; you'm don' need for
be 'fraid for dat."

The cowpuncher whirled and spurred his horse to overtake the cowboys
who, with the prisoner in charge, were already well out upon the trail.

In front of the hotel the half-breed watched the flying horseman until
he disappeared from sight.

"A'm wonder if dat girl be safe wit' him, lak' she is wit' me--_bien_.
A'm t'ink mebbe-so dat damn good t'ing ol' Bat goin' long.  If she damn
fine girl mebbe-so Tex, he goin' mar' her.  Dat be good t'ing.  But, by
Gar! if he don' mar' her, he gon' leave her 'lone.  Me--A'm lak' dat
Tex fine, lak' me own brudder.  He got de good heart.  But w'en he
drink de hooch, den A'm got for look after him.  He don' care wan damn
'bout nuttin'.  Dat four bit in Las Vegas, dats a'right.  A'm fink
'bout dat, too.  But, by Gar, it tak' more'n four bit in Las Vegas for
mak' of Bat let dat girl git harm."


An atmosphere of depression pervaded the group of riders as they wound
in and out of the cottonwood clumps and threaded the deep coulee that
led to the bench.  For the most part they preserved an owlish silence,
but now and then someone would break into a low, weird refrain and the
others would join in with the mournful strain of "The Dying Cowboy."

  "Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie-e-e,
  Where the coyote howls and the wind blows free."

Or the dirge-like wail of the "Cowboy's Lament":

  "Then swing your rope slowly and rattle your spurs lowly,
  And give a wild whoop as you carry me along:
  And in the grave throw me and roll the sod o'er me,
  For I'm only a cowboy that knows he's done wrong."

"Shall we take him to Lone Tree Coulee?" asked one.  Another answered
disdainfully.

"Don't you know the lone tree's dead?  Jest shrivelled up an' died
after Bill Atwood was hung onto it.  Some augers he worn't guilty.  But
it's better to play safe, an' string up all the doubtful ones, then yer
bound to git the right one onct in a while."

"Swing over into Buffalo Coulee," commanded Tex.  "There's a bunch of
cottonwoods just above Hansen's old sheep ranch."

  "We'll string him up to a cottonwood limb
  An' dig his grave in under him----"

"Shut up!" ordered Curly, favouring the singer with a scowl.  "Any one
would think you was joyous-minded, which this here hangin' a man is
plumb serious business, even if it hain't only a pilgrim!"

He edged his horse in beside the Texan's.  "He don't seem tore up with
terror, none.  D'you think he's onto the racket?"

Tex shook his head, and with his eyes on the face of the prisoner which
showed very white in the moonlight, rode on in silence.

"You mean you think he's jest nach'ly got guts--an' him a pilgrim?"

"How the hell do I know what he's got?" snapped the other.  "Can't you
wait till we get to Buffalo?"

Curly allowed his horse to fall back a few paces.  "First time I ever
know'd Tex to pack a grouch," he mused, as his lips drew into a grin.
"He's sore 'cause the pilgrim hain't a-snifflin' an' a-carryin'-on an'
tryin' to beg off.  Gosh!  If he turns out to be a reg'lar hand, an'
steps up an' takes his medicine like a man, the joke'll be on Tex.  The
boys never will quit joshin' him--an' he knows it.  No wonder he's
sore."

The cowboys rode straight across the bench.  Song and conversation had
ceased and the only sounds were the low clink of bit chains and the
soft rustle of horses' feet in the buffalo grass.  At the end of an
hour the leaders swung into an old grass-grown trail that led by
devious windings into a deep, steep-sided coulee along the bottom of
which ran the bed of a dried-up creek.  Water from recent rains stood
in brackish pools.  Remnants of fence with rotted posts sagging from
rusty wire paralleled their course.  A dilapidated cross-fence barred
their way, and without dismounting, a cowboy loosened the wire gate and
threw it aside.

A deserted log-house, windowless, with one corner rotted away, and the
sod roof long since tumbled in, stood upon a treeless bend of the dry
creek.  Abandoned implements littered the dooryard; a rusted hay rake
with one wheel gone, a broken mower with cutter-bar drunkenly erect,
and the front trucks of a dilapidated wagon.

The Texan's eyes rested sombrely upon the remnant of a rocking-horse,
still hitched by bits of weather-hardened leather to a child's
wheelbarrow whose broken wheel had once been the bottom of a wooden
pail--and he swore, softly.

Up the creek he could see the cottonwood grove just bursting into leaf
and as they rounded the corner of a long sheep-shed, whose soggy straw
roof sagged to the ground, a coyote, disturbed in his prowling among
the whitening bones of dead sheep, slunk out of sight in a weed-patch.

Entering the grove, the men halted at a point where the branches of
three large trees interlaced.  It was darker, here.  The moonlight
filtered through in tiny patches which brought out the faces of the men
with grotesque distinctness and plunged them again into blackness.

Gravely the Texan edged his horse to the side of the pilgrim.

"Get off!" he ordered tersely, and Endicott dismounted.

"Tie his hands!"  A cowboy caught the man's hands behind him and
secured them with a lariat-rope.

The Texan unknotted the silk muffler from about his neck and folded it.

"If it is just the same to you," the pilgrim asked, in a voice that
held firm, "will you leave that off?"

Without a word the muffler was returned to its place.

"Throw the rope over that limb--the big one that sticks out this way,"
ordered the Texan, and a cowpuncher complied.

"The knot had ort to come in under his left ear," suggested one, and
proceeded to twist the noose into place.

"All ready!"

A dozen hands grasped the end of the rope.

The Texan surveyed the details critically:

"This here is a disagreeable job," he said.  "Have you got anything to
say?"

Endicott took a step forward, and as he faced the Texan, his eyes
flashed.  "Have I got anything to say!" he sneered.  "Would you have
anything to say if a bunch of half-drunken fools decided to take the
law into their own hands and hang you for defending a woman against the
brutal attack of a fiend?"  He paused and wrenched to free his hands
but the rope held firm.  "It was a wise precaution you took when you
ordered my hands tied--a precaution that fits in well with this whole
damned cowardly proceeding.  And now you ask me if I have anything to
say!"  He glanced into the faces of the cowboys who seemed to be
enjoying the situation hugely.

"I've got this to say--to you, and to your whole bunch of grinning
hyenas: If you expect me to do any begging or whimpering, you are in
for a big disappointment.  There is one request I am going to make--and
that you won't grant.  Just untie my hands for ten minutes and stand up
to me bare-fisted.  I want one chance before I go, to fight you, or any
of you, or all of you!  Or, if you are afraid to fight that way, give
me a pistol--I never fired one until tonight--and let me shoot it out
with you.  Surely men who swagger around with pistols in their belts,
and pride themselves on the use of them, ought not to be afraid to take
a chance against a man who has never but once fired one!"  There was an
awkward pause and the pilgrim laughed harshly: "There isn't an ounce of
sporting blood among you!  You hunt in packs like the wolves you
are--twenty to one--and that one with a rope around his neck and his
hands tied!"

"The odds is a little against you," drawled the Texan.  "Where might
you hail from?"

"From a place where they breed men--not curs."

"Ain't you afraid to die?"

"Just order your hounds to jerk on that rope and I'll show you whether
or not I am afraid to die.  But let me tell you this, you damned
murderer!  If any harm comes to that girl--to Miss Marcum--may the
curse of God follow every last one of you till you are damned in a
fiery hell!  You will kill me now, but you won't be rid of me.  I'll
haunt you every one to your graves.  I will follow you night and day
till your brains snap and you go howling to hell like maniacs."

Several of the cowboys shuddered and turned away.  Very deliberately
the Texan rolled a cigarette.

"There is a box in my coat pocket, will you hand me one?  Or is it
against the rules to smoke?"  Without a word the Texan complied, and as
he held a match to the cigarette he stared straight into the man's
eyes: "You've started out good," he remarked gravely.  "I'm just
wonderin' if you can play your string out."  With which enigmatical
remark he turned to the cowboys: "The drinks are on me, boys.  Jerk off
that rope, an' go back to town!  An' remember, this lynchin' come off
as per schedule."

Alone in the cottonwood grove, with little patches of moonlight
filtering through onto the new-sprung grass, the two men faced each
other.  Without a word the cowboy freed the prisoner's hands.

"Viewin' it through a lariat-loop, that way, the country looks better
to a man than what it really is," he observed, as the other stretched
his arms above his head.

"What is the meaning of all this?  The lynching would have been an
atrocious injustice, but if you did not intend to hang me why should
you have taken the trouble to bring me out here?"

"'Twasn't no trouble at all.  The main thing was to get you out of Wolf
River.  The lynchin' part was only a joke, an' that's on us.  You bein'
a pilgrim, that way, we kind of thought----"

"A what?"

"A pilgrim, or tenderfoot, or greener or chechako, or counter-jumper,
owin' to what part of the country you misfit into.  We thought you
wouldn't have no guts, an' we'd----"

"Any what?"

The Texan regarded the other hopelessly.  "Oh hell!" he muttered
disgustedly.   "Can't you talk no English?  Where was you raised?"

The other laughed.  "Go on, I will try to follow you."

"I can't chop 'em up no finer than one syllable.  But I'll shorten up
the dose sufficient for your understandin' to grasp.  It's this way:
D'you know what a frame-up is?"

Endicott nodded.

"Well, Choteau County politics is in such a condition of onwee that a
hangin' would be a reg'lar tonic for the party that's in; which it's
kind of bogged down into an old maid's tea party.  Felonious
takin's-off has be'n common enough, but there hasn't no hangin's
resulted, for the reason that in every case the hangee has got friends
or relations of votin' influence.  Now, along comes you without no
votin' connections an' picks off Purdy, which he's classed amongst
human bein's, an' is therefore felonious to kill.  There ain't nothin'
to it.  They'd be poundin' away on the scaffold an' testin' the rope
while the trial was goin' on.  Besides which you'd have to linger in a
crummy jail for a couple of months waitin' for the grand jury to set on
you.  A few of us boys seen how things was framed an' we took the
liberty to turn you loose, not because we cared a damn about you, but
we'd hate to see even a snake hung fer killin' Purdy which his folks
done a wrong to humanity by raisin' him.

"The way the thing is now, if the boys plays the game accordin' to
Hoyle, there won't be no posses out huntin' you 'cause folks will all
think you was lynched.  But even if they is a posse or two, which the
chances is there will be, owin' to the loosenin' effect of spiritorious
licker on the tongue, which it will be indulged in liberal when that
bunch hits town, we can slip down into the bad lands an' lay low for a
while, an' then on to the N. P. an' you can get out of the country."

Endicott extended his hand: "I thank you," he said.  "It is certainly
white of you boys to go out of your way to help a perfect stranger.  I
have no desire to thrust my neck into a noose to further the ends of
politics.  One experience of the kind is quite sufficient."

"Never mind oratin' no card of thanks.  Just you climb up into the
middle of that bronc an' we'll be hittin' the trail.  We got quite some
ridin' to do before we get to the bad lands--an' quite some after."

Endicott reached for the bridle reins of his horse which was cropping
grass a few feet distant.

"But Alice--Miss Marcum!"  With the reins in his hand he faced the
Texan.  "I must let her know I am safe.  She will think I have been
lynched and----"

"She's goin' along," interrupted the Texan, gruffly.

"Going along!"

"Yes, she was bound to see you through because what you done was on her
account.  Bat an' her'll be waitin' for us at Snake Creek crossin'."

"Who is Bat?"

"He's a breed."

"A what?"

"Wait an' see!" growled Tex.  "Come on; we can't set here 'til you get
educated.  You'd ought to went to school when you was young."

Endicott reached for a stirrup and the horse leaped sidewise with a
snort of fear.  Again and again the man tried to insert a foot into the
broad wooden stirrup, but always the horse jerked away.  Round and
round in a circle they went, while the Texan sat in his saddle and
rolled a cigarette.

"Might try the other one," he drawled, as he struck a match.  "Don't
you know no better than to try to climb onto a horse on the right-hand
side?  You must of be'n brought up on G-Dots."

"What's a G-Dot?"

"There you go again.  Do I look like a school-marm?  A G-Dot is an
Injun horse an' you can get on 'em from both sides or endways.  Come
on; Snake Creek crossin' is a good fifteen miles from here, an' we
better pull out of this coulee while the moon holds."

Endicott managed to mount, and gathering up the reins urged his horse
forward.  But the animal refused to go and despite the man's utmost
efforts, backed farther and farther into the brush.

"Just shove on them bridle reins a little," observed the Texan dryly.
"I think he's swallerin' the bit.  What you got him all yanked in for?
D'you think the head-stall won't hold the bit in?  Or ain't his mouth
cut back far enough to suit you?  These horses is broke to be rode with
a loose rein.  Give him his head an' he'll foller along."

A half-mile farther up the coulee, the Texan headed up a ravine that
led to the level of the bench, and urging his horse into a long
swinging trot, started for the mountains.  Mile after mile they rode,
the cowboy's lips now and then drawing into their peculiar smile as,
out of the corner of his eye he watched the vain efforts of his
companion to maintain a firm seat in the saddle.  "He's game, though,"
he muttered, grudgingly.  "He rides like a busted wind-mill an' it must
be just tearin' hell out of him but he never squawks.  An' the way he
took that hangin'----  If he'd be'n raised right he'd sure made some
tough hand.  An' pilgrim or no pilgrim, the guts is there."


CHAPTER X

THE FLIGHT

When the Texan had departed Bat Lajune eyed the side-saddle with
disgust.  "Dat damn t'ing, she ain' no good.  A'm git de reg'lar
saddle."

Slowly he pushed open the side door of the hotel and paused in the
darkened hallway to stare at the crack of yellow light that showed
beneath the door of Number 11.

"A'm no lak' dis fool 'roun' wit' 'omen."  He made a wry face and
knocked gingerly.

Jennie Dodds opened the door, and for a moment eyed the half-breed with
frowning disfavour.

"Look a here, Bat Lajune, is this on the level?  They say you're the
squarest Injun that ever swung a rope.  But Injun or white, you're a
man, an' I wouldn't trust one as far as I could throw a mule by the
tail."

"Mebbe-so you lak' you com' 'long an' see, eh?"

"I got somethin' else to do besides galavantin' 'round the country
nights with cowboys an' Injuns."

The half-breed laughed and turned to Alice.  "Better you bor' some
pants for ride de horse.  Me, A'm gon' git nudder saddle.  'Fore you
ride little ways you bre'k you back."

"Go over to the livery barn an' tell Ross to put my reg'lar saddle on
in place of the side-saddle, an' when you come back she'll be ready."
Jennie Dodds slipped from the room as the outer door closed upon the
half-breed's departure, and returned a few minutes later with her own
riding outfit, which she tossed onto the bed.

"Jest you climb into them, dearie," she said.  "Bat's right.  Them
side-saddles is sure the dickens an' all, if you got any ways to go."

"But," objected Alice, "I can't run off with all your things this way!"
She reached for her purse.  "I'll tell you, I'll buy them from you,
horse and all!"

"No you won't, no such thing!" Jennie Dodds assumed an injured tone.
"Pity a body can't loan a friend nuthin' without they're offered to git
payed for it.  You can send the clothes back when you're through with
'em.  An' here's a sack.  Jest stick what you need in that.  It'll tie
on behind your saddle, an' you can leave the rest of your stuff here in
your grip an I'll ship it on when you're ready for it.  Better leave
them night-gowns an' corsets an' such like here.  You ain't goin' to
find no use for 'em out there amongst the prickly pears an' sage brush.
Law me!  I don't envy you your trip none!  I'd jest like to know what
for devilment that Tex Benton's up to.  Anyways, you don't need to be
afraid of him--like Purdy.  But men is men, an' you got to watch 'em."

As the girl chattered on she helped Alice to dress for the trail and
when the "war-bag" was packed and tied with a stout cord, the girl
crossed to the window and drew back the shade.

"The Injun's back.  You better be goin'."  The girl slipped a small
revolver from her pocket and pressed it into Alice's hand.  "There's a
pocket for it in the bloomers.  Cinnabar Joe give it to me a long time
ago.  Take care of yourself an' don't be afraid to use it if you have
to.  An' mind you let me hear jest the minute you git anywheres.  I'll
be a-dyin' to know what become of you."

Alice promised and as she passed through the door, leaned swiftly and
kissed the girl squarely upon the lips.

"Good-bye," she whispered.  "I won't forget you," and the next moment
she stepped out to join the waiting half-breed, who with a glance of
approval at her costume, took the bag from her hand and proceeded to
secure it behind the cantle.  The girl mounted without assistance, and
snubbing the lead-rope of the pack-horse about the horn of his saddle,
the half-breed led off into the night.

Hour after hour they rode in silence, following a trail that wound in
easy curves about the bases of hillocks and small buttes, and dipped
and slanted down the precipitous sides of deep coulees where the
horses' feet splashed loudly in the shallow waters of fords.  As the
moon dipped lower and lower, they rode past the darkened buildings of
ranches nestled beside the creeks, and once they passed a band of sheep
camped near the trail.  The moonlight showed a sea of grey, woolly
backs, and on a near-by knoll stood a white-covered camp-wagon, with a
tiny lantern burning at the end of the tongue.  A pair of hobbled
horses left off snipping grass beside the trail and gazed with mild
interest as the two passed, and beneath the wagon a dog barked.  At
length, just as the moon sank from sight behind the long spur of Tiger
Butte, the trail slanted into a wide coulee from the bottom of which
sounded the tinkle of running water.

"Dis Snake Creek," remarked the Indian; "better you git off now an'
stretch you leg.  Me, A'm mak' de blanket on de groun' an' you ketch-um
little sleep.  Mebbe-so dem com' queek--mebbe-so long tam'."

Even as he talked the man spread a pair of new blankets beside the
trail and walking a short distance away seated himself upon a rock and
lighted a cigarette.

With muscles aching from the unaccustomed strain of hours in the
saddle, Alice threw herself upon the blankets and pillowed her head on
the slicker that the half-breed had folded for the purpose.  Almost
immediately she fell asleep only to awake a few moments later with
every bone in her body registering an aching protest at the unbearable
hardness of her bed.  In vain she turned from one side to the other, in
an effort to attain a comfortable position.  With nerves shrieking at
each new attitude, all thought of sleep vanished and the girl's brain
raced madly over the events of the past few hours.  Yesterday she had
sat upon the observation platform of the overland train and complained
to Endicott of the humdrum conventionality of her existence!  Only
yesterday--and it seemed weeks ago.  The dizzy whirl of events that had
snatched her from the beaten path and deposited her somewhere out upon
the rim of the world had come upon her so suddenly and with such
stupendous import that it beggared any attempt to forecast its outcome.
With a shudder she recalled the moment upon the verge of the bench when
in a flash she had realized the true character of Purdy and her own
utter helplessness.  With a great surge of gratitude--and--was it only
gratitude--this admiration and pride in the achievement of the man who
had rushed to her rescue?  Alone there in the darkness the girl flushed
to the roots of her hair as she realized that it was for this man she
had unhesitatingly and unquestioningly ridden far into the night in
company with an unknown Indian.  Realized, also, that above the pain of
her tortured muscles, above the uncertainty of her own position, was
the anxiety and worry as to the fate of Endicott.  Where was he?  Had
Tex lied when he told her there would be no lynching?  Even if he
desired could he prevent the cowboys from wreaking their vengeance upon
the man who had killed one of their number?  She recalled with a
shudder the cold cynicism of the smile that habitually curled the lips
of the Texan.  A man who could smile like that could lie--could do
anything to gain an end.  And yet--she realized with a puzzled frown
that in her heart was no fear of him--no terror such as struck into her
very soul at the sudden unmasking of Purdy.  "It's his eyes," she
murmured; "beneath his cynical exterior lies a man of finer fibre."

Some distance away a match flared in the darkness and went out, and
dimly by the little light of the stars Alice made out the form of the
half-breed seated upon his rock beside the trail.  Motionless as the
rock itself the man sat humped over with his arms entwining his knees.
A sombre figure, and one that fitted intrinsically into the scene--the
dark shapes of the three horses that snipped grass beside the trail,
the soft murmur of the waters of the creek as they purled over the
stones, the black wall of the coulee, with the mountains rising
beyond--all bespoke the wild that since childhood she had pictured, but
never before had seen.  Under any other circumstances the setting would
have appealed, would have thrilled her to the soul.  But now--over and
over through her brain repeated the question: Where is he?

A horse nickered softly and raising his head, sniffed the night air.
The Indian stepped from his rock and stood alert with his eyes on the
reach of the back-trail.  And then softly, almost inaudibly to the ears
of the girl came the sound of horses' hoofs pounding the trail in
monotonous rhythm.

Leaping to her feet she rushed forward in time to see Bat catch up the
reins of the three horses and slip noiselessly into the shelter of a
bunch of scrub willows.  In a moment she was at his side and the Indian
thrust the reins into her hand.

"Better you wait here," he whispered hurriedly.  "Mebbe-so, som'wan
else com' 'long.  Me, A'm gon' for look."  With the words the man
blended into the shadows and, clutching the reins, the girl waited with
every nerve drawn tense.

Nearer and nearer came the sound of the thudding hoofs.  The riders had
reached the dip of the trail now and the rhythmic pound of the horses'
feet changed to a syncopated shuffle as the animals made the steep
descent.  At the edge of the creek they paused for a moment and then
Alice, could hear the splash of their feet in the water and the deep
sucking sound of horses drinking.

A low peculiar whistle cut the air and the next moment a voice which
the girl recognized as the Texan's sounded plainly through the dark.

"You got here, did you?  Where's the girl?"  Alice could not catch the
answer but at the next words of the Texan she started forward tugging
at the reins of the refractory cayuses.

"Come alive, now, an' get your outfit together.  There's prob'ly a big
posse out an' we got to scratch gravel some lively to keep ahead of
'em, which little item the future prosperity of all concerned, as the
fellow says, depends on--not only the hangee here, but us accessories,
the law bein' some specific in outlinin' the disposal of aiders an'
abettors of felonious transmigrations."

The half-breed relieved her of the horses and Alice rushed to the side
of Endicott who had reined his horse out of the water and dismounted
stiffly.

"Oh, Winthrop!" she cried joyfully.  "Then they didn't hang you,
and----"

Endicott laughed: "No, they didn't hang me but they put a lot of local
colour into the preliminaries.  I certainly thought my time had come,
when friend Tex here gave the word to throw off the rope."  The girl
flashed a grateful glance into the face of the Texan who sat his horse
with the peculiar smile curling his lips.

"Oh, how can I ever thank you?" she cried impulsively.  "I think you
are just _splendid_!  And I'll never, _never_ distrust you again.  I've
been a perfect fool and----"

"Yes," answered the man gruffly, and Alice noticed that the smile was
gone from his lips.  "But you ain't out of the woods yet.  Bat's got
that horse packed an' as soon as Winthrup, there, can crawl up the side
of that bronc we better be hittin' the trail.  If we can make the
timber at the head of Cow Creek divide by daylight, we can slip down
into the bad lands tomorrow night."

Endicott painfully raised a foot to the stirrup, and the Texan turned
abruptly to the girl.

"Can you make it?" he asked.  She replied with an eager affirmative and
the Texan shot her a glance of approval as he watched her mount, for
well he knew that she must have fared very little better than Endicott
in the matter of aching muscles.

Mile after mile the four rode in silence, Tex in the lead with Bat
Lajune close by his side.  An occasional backward glance revealed the
clumsy efforts of the pilgrim to ease himself in the saddle, and the
set look of determination upon the tired face of the girl.

"Winthrup ain't wearin' well," thought the cowboy as his lips twisted
into a smile, "but what could you expect with a name like that?  I'm
afraid Winthrup is goin' to wish I hadn't interfered none with his
demise, but he won't squawk, an' neither will she.  There's the makin's
of a couple of good folks wasted in them two pilgrims," and he frowned
darkly at the recollection of the note of genuine relief and gladness
with which the girl had greeted Endicott; a frown that deepened at the
girl's impulsive words to himself, "I think you are just splendid.
I'll never distrust you again."  "She's a fool!" he muttered under his
breath.  At his side the half-breed regarded him shrewdly from under
the broad brim of his hat.

"Dat girl she dam' fine 'oman.  She got, w'at you call, de nerve."

"It's a good thing it ain't daytime," growled the Texan surlily, "or
that there tongue of yourn would get sun-burnt the way you keep it
a-goin'."

Upon the crest of a high foothill that is a spur of Tiger Ridge, Tex
swerved abruptly from the trail and headed straight for the mountains
that loomed out of the darkness.  On and on he rode, keeping wherever
possible to the higher levels to avoid the fences of the nesters whose
fields and pastures followed the windings of the creek bottoms.

Higher and higher they climbed and rougher grew the way.  The scrub
willows gave place to patches of bull pine and the long stretches of
buffalo grass to ugly bare patches of black rock.  In and out of the
scrub timber they wended, following deep coulees to their sources and
crossing steep-pitched divides into other coulees.  The fences of the
nesters were left far behind and following old game trails, or no
trails at all, the Texan pushed unhesitatingly forward.  At last, just
as the dim outlines of the mountains were beginning to assume definite
shape in the first faint hint of the morning grey, he pulled into a
more extensive patch of timber than any they had passed and dismounting
motioned the others to the ground.

While the Texan prepared breakfast, Bat busied himself with the
blankets and when the meal was finished Alice found a tent awaiting
her, which the half-breed had constructed by throwing the pack-tarp
over a number of light poles whose ends rested upon a fallen
tree-trunk.  The Confederates were known to be building a great iron-clad
ram, and the wooden vessels were eagerly watching for her appearance
when she should come out of Gosport Harbor. Her powers and capacity
were utterly unknown. She was made out of the former United States
steam-frigate Merrimac, cut down so as to make her fore and aft decks
nearly flat, and not much above the water, while the guns were mounted
in a covered central battery, with sloping flanks. Her sides, deck,
and battery were coated with iron, and she was armed with formidable
rifle-guns, and, most important of all, with a steel ram thrust
out under water forward from her bow.

She was commanded by a gallant and efficient officer, Captain Buchanan.

It was March 8, 1862, when the ram at last made her appearance
within sight of the Union fleet.

The day was calm and very clear, so that the throngs of spectators
on shore could see every feature of the battle.
With the great ram came three light gunboats, all of which took
part in the action, harassing the vessels which she assailed; but
they were not factors of importance in the fight.

On the Union side the vessels nearest were the sailing-ships Cumberland
and Congress, and the steam-frigate Minnesota. The Congress and Cumberland
were anchored not far from each other; the Minnesota got aground, and
was some distance off. Owing to the currents and shoals and the lack
of wind, no other vessel was able to get up in time to take a part
in the fight.

As soon as the ram appeared, out of the harbor, she turned and
steamed toward the Congress and the Cumberland, the black smoke
rising from her funnels, and the great ripples running from each
side of her iron prow as she drove steadily through the still waters.

On board of the Congress and Cumberland there was eager anticipation,
but not a particle of fear.
The officers in command, Captain Smith and Lieutenant Morris, were two
of the most gallant men in a service where gallantry has always been too
common to need special comment. The crews were composed of veterans,
well trained, self-confident, and proud beyond measure of the flag whose
honor they upheld. The guns were run out, and the men stood at quarters,
while the officers eagerly conned the approaching ironclad. The
Congress was the first to open fire; and, as her volleys flew, the
men on the Cumberland were astounded to see the cannon-shot bound
off the sloping sides of the ram as hailstones bound from a windowpane.

The ram answered, and her rifle-shells tore the sides of the Congress;
but for her first victim she aimed at the Cumberland, and, firing her
bow guns, came straight as an arrow at the little sloop-of-war,
which lay broadside to her.

It was an absolutely hopeless struggle. The Cumberland was a sailing-ship,
at anchor, with wooden sides, and a battery of light guns.
Against the formidable steam ironclad, with her heavy rifles and steel
ram, she was as powerless as if she had been a rowboat; and from
the moment the men saw the cannon-shot bound from the ram's sides they
knew they were doomed. But none of them flinched. Once and again they
fired their guns full against the approaching ram, and in response
received a few shells from the great bow-rifles of the latter.

Then, forging ahead, the Merrimac struck her antagonist with
her steel prow, and the sloop-of-war reeled and shuddered, and through
the great rent in her side the black water rushed. She foundered in a
few minutes; but her crew fought her to the last, cheering as they ran
out the guns, and sending shot after shot against the ram as the
latter backed off after delivering her blow. The rush of the water
soon swamped the lower decks, but the men above continued to serve
their guns until the upper deck also was awash, and the vessel had
not ten seconds of life left.

Then, with her flags flying, her men cheering, and her guns firing,
the Cumberland sank.

It was shallow where she settled down, so that her masts remained
above the water.

The glorious flag for which the brave men aboard her had died flew proudly
in the wind all that day, while the fight went on, and throughout the
night; and next morning it was still streaming over the beautiful bay,
to mark the resting-place of as gallant a vessel as ever sailed or fought
on the high seas.

After the Cumberland sank, the ram turned her attention to the
Congress.
Finding it difficult to get to her in the shoal water, she began
to knock her to pieces with her great rifle-guns.

The unequal fight between the ironclad and the wooden ship lasted for
perhaps half an hour. By that time the commander of the Congress had
been killed, and her decks looked like a slaughterhouse. She was utterly
unable to make any impression on her foe, and finally she took fire
and blew up. The Minnesota was the third victim marked for
destruction, and the Merrimac began the attack upon her at once;
but it was getting very late, and as the water was shoal and she
could not get close, the rain finally drew back to her anchorage,
to wait until next day before renewing and completing her work of
destruction.

All that night there was the wildest exultation among the Confederates,
while the gloom and panic of the Union men cannot be described.
It was evident that the United States ships-of-war were as helpless as
cockle-shells against their iron-clad foe, and there was no question but
that she could destroy the whole fleet with ease and with absolute
impunity. This meant not only the breaking of the blockade; but the
sweeping away at one blow of the North's naval supremacy, which was
indispensable to the success of the war for the Union. It is small
wonder that during that night the wisest and bravest should have almost
despaired.

But in the hour of the nation's greatest need a champion suddenly appeared,
in time to play the last scene in this great drama of sea warfare.
The North, too, had been trying its hand at building ironclads.
The most successful of them was the little Monitor, a flat-decked,
low, turreted, ironclad, armed with a couple of heavy guns.

She was the first experiment of her kind, and her absolutely flat
surface, nearly level with the water, her revolving turret, and her
utter unlikeness to any pre-existing naval type, had made her an
object of mirth among most practical seamen; but her inventor, Ericsson,
was not disheartened in the least by the jeers. Under the command
of a gallant naval officer, Captain Worden, she was sent South from New
York, and though she almost foundered in a gale she managed to
weather it, and reached the scene of the battle at Hampton Roads
at the moment when her presence was all-important.

Early the following morning the Merrimac, now under Captain Jones (for
Buchanan had been wounded), again steamed forth to take up
the work she had so well begun and to destroy the Union fleet. She
steered straight for the Minnesota; but when she was almost there, to
her astonishment a strange-looking little craft advanced from the side
of the big wooden frigate and boldly barred the Merrimac's path. For
a moment the Confederates could hardly believe their eyes. The
Monitor was tiny, compared to their ship, for she was not one fifth the
size, and her queer appearance made them look at their new foe
with contempt; but the first shock of battle did away with this
feeling.

The Merrimac turned on her foe her rifleguns, intending to blow
her out of the water, but the shot glanced from the thick iron turret
of the Monitor. Then the Monitors guns opened fire, and as the great
balls struck the sides of the ram her plates started and her timbers
gave. Had the Monitor been such a vessel as those of her type
produced later in the war, the ram would have been sunk then and
there; but as it was her shot were not quite heavy enough to pierce the
iron walls. Around and around the two strange combatants hovered,
their guns bellowing without cessation, while the men on the frigates
and on shore watched the result with breathless interest. Neither the
Merrimac nor the Monitor could dispose of its antagonist. The ram's
guns could not damage the turret, and the Monitor was able dexterously
to avoid the stroke of the formidable prow. On the other hand, the shot
of the Monitor could not penetrate the Merrimac's tough sides.
Accordingly, fierce though the struggle was, and much though there
was that hinged on it, it was not bloody in character.
The Merrimac could neither destroy nor evade the Monitor. She could
not sink her when she tried to, and when she abandoned her and
turned to attack one of the other wooden vessels, the little turreted
ship was thrown across her path, so that the fight had to be renewed.

Both sides grew thoroughly exhausted, and finally the battle ceased by
mutual consent.

Nothing more could be done. The ram was badly damaged, and there was no
help for her save to put back to the port whence she had come.
Twice afterward she came out, but neither time did she come near enough
to the Monitor to attack her, and the latter could not move off where
she would cease to protect the wooden vessels. The ram was ultimately
blown up by the Confederates on the advance of the Union army.

Tactically, the fight was a drawn battle--neither ship being able to
damage the other, and both ships, being fought to a standstill; but
the moral and material effects were wholly in favor of the Monitor.

Her victory was hailed with exultant joy throughout the whole Union,
and exercised a correspondingly depressing effect in the Confederacy;
while every naval man throughout the world, who possessed eyes to
see, saw that the fight in Hampton Roads had inaugurated a new era
in ocean warfare, and that the Monitor and Merrimac, which had waged
so gallant and so terrible a battle, were the first ships of the
new era, and that as such their names would be forever famous.

THE FLAG-BEARER
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling
out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed
the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching
on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps; They
have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read his
righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching
on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never beat retreat; He
is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat; Oh!

be swift, my soul, to answer him! be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.
--Julia Ward Howe.

In no war since the close of the great Napoleonic struggles has the
fighting been so obstinate and bloody as in the Civil War.

Much has been said in song and story of the resolute courage of the
Guards at Inkerman, of the charge of the Light Brigade, and of the
terrible fighting and loss of the German armies at Mars La Tour and
Gravelotte.
The praise bestowed, upon the British and Germans for their valor,
and for the loss that proved their valor, was well deserved; but
there were over one hundred and twenty regiments, Union and
Confederate, each of which, in some one battle of the Civil War,
suffered a greater loss than any English regiment at Inkerman or
at any other battle in the Crimea, a greater loss than was suffered
by any German regiment at Gravelotte or at any other battle of the
Franco-Prussian war.

No European regiment in any recent struggle has suffered such losses as
at Gettysburg befell the 1st Minnesota, when 82 per cent. of the officers
and men were killed and wounded; or the 141st Pennsylvania, which lost
76 per cent.; or the 26th North Carolina, which lost 72 per cent.;
such as at the second battle of Manassas befell the 101st New York,
which lost 74 per cent., and the 21st Georgia, which lost 76 per
cent.

At Cold Harbor the 25th Massachusetts lost 70 per cent., and the 10th
Tennessee at Chickamauga 68 per cent.; while at Shiloh the 9th Illinois
lost 63 per cent., and the 6th Mississippi 70 per cent.; and at
Antietam the 1st Texas lost 82 percent.

The loss of the Light Brigade in killed and wounded in its famous
charge at Balaklava was but 37 per cent.

These figures show the terrible punishment endured by these regiments,
chosen at random from the head of the list which shows the
slaughter-roll of the Civil War.

Yet the shattered remnants of each regiment preserved their organization,
and many of the severest losses were incurred in the hour of
triumph, and not of disaster. Thus, the 1st Minnesota, at Gettysburg,
suffered its appalling loss while charging a greatly superior force,
which it drove before it; and the little huddle of wounded and
unwounded men who survived their victorious charge actually kept
both the flag they had captured and the ground from which they had
driven their foes.

A number of the Continental regiments under Washington, Greene, and Wayne
did valiant fighting and endured heavy punishment. Several of the
regiments raised on the northern frontier in 1814 showed, under Brown
and Scott, that they were able to meet the best troops of Britain
on equal terms in the open, and even to overmatch them in fair fight
with the bayonet.

The regiments which, in the Mexican war, under the lead of Taylor,
captured Monterey, and beat back Santa Anna at Buena Vista, or
which, with Scott as commander, stormed Molino Del Rey and Chapultepec,
proved their ability to bear terrible loss, to wrest victory from
overwhelming numbers, and to carry by open assault positions of
formidable strength held by a veteran army.

But in none of these three wars was the fighting so resolute and bloody
as in the Civil War.

Countless deeds of heroism were performed by Northerner and by
Southerner, by officer and by private, in every year of the great
struggle. The immense majority of these deeds went unrecorded, and
were known to few beyond the immediate participants. Of those that were
noticed it would be impossible even to make a dry catalogue in ten
such volumes as this.

All that can be done is to choose out two or three acts of heroism, not
as exceptions, but as examples of hundreds of others.
The times of war are iron times, and bring out all that is best as well
as all that is basest in the human heart.

In a full recital of the civil war, as of every other great conflict,
there would stand out in naked relief feats of wonderful daring and
self-devotion, and, mixed among them, deeds of cowardice, of
treachery, of barbarous brutality.

Sadder still, such a recital would show strange contrasts in the careers
of individual men, men who at one time acted well and nobly, and
at another time ill and basely.

The ugly truths must not be blinked, and the lessons they teach should
be set forth by every historian, and learned by every statesman and
soldier; but, for our good fortune, the lessons best worth learning
in the nation's past are lessons of heroism.

From immemorial time the armies of every warlike people have set the
highest value upon the standards they bore to battle.

To guard one's own flag against capture is the pride, to capture the
flag of one's enemy the ambition, of every valiant soldier. In consequence,
in every war between peoples of good military record, feats of daring
performed by color-bearers are honorably common. The Civil War was
full of such incidents.

Out of very many two or three may be mentioned as noteworthy.

One occurred at Fredericksburg on the day when half the brigades of
Meagher and Caldwell lay on the bloody slope leading up to the
Confederate entrenchments.

Among the assaulting regiments was the 5th New Hampshire, and it
lost one hundred and eighty-six out of three hundred men who made the
charge. The survivors fell sullenly back behind a fence, within easy
range of the Confederate rifle-pits.

Just before reaching it the last of the color guard was shot, and the
flag fell in the open.

The girl's revolver was levelled at the man's head, and
the next instant she heard the Texan laugh softly.

"Just point it the other way, please, if it's loaded.  A fellow shot me
with one of those once an' I had a headache all the rest of the
evenin'."  His horse nosed in beside hers.  "It's just as I thought,"
he explained.  "Everyone around the outfit's dead to the world.  Bein'
up all night dancin', an' most of the next day trailin' home, you
couldn't get 'em up for a poker game--let alone hangin' a pilgrim."

Alice's fear vanished the moment the Texan appeared.  His air of
absolute self-confidence in his ability to handle a situation compelled
the confidence of others.

"Aren't your nerves ever shaken?  Aren't you ever afraid?" she asked.

Tex smiled: "Nerve ain't in not bein' afraid," he answered evasively,
"but in not lettin' folks know when you're afraid."

Another gate was opened, and as they passed around the scrub-capped
spur of a ridge that projected into the widening valley, the girl drew
her horse up sharply and pointed ahead.

"Oh!  A little lake!" she cried enthusiastically.  "See how the
moonlight shimmers on the tiny waves."

Heavy and low from the westward came an ominous growl of thunder.

"Yes.  An' there'll be somethin' besides moonlight a-shimmerin' around
here directly.  That ain't exactly a lake.  It's Johnson's irrigation
reservoir.  If we could get about ten miles below here before the storm
hits, we can hole up in a rock cave 'til she blows over.  The creek
valley narrows down to a canyon where it cuts through the last ridge of
mountains.

"Hit 'er up a little, Bat.  We'll try an' make the canyon!"

A flash of lightning illumined the valley, and glancing upward, Alice
saw that the mass of black clouds was almost overhead.  The horses were
forced into a run as the hills reverberated to the mighty roll of the
thunder.  They were following a well-defined bridle trail and scarcely
slackened their pace as they splashed in and out of the water where the
trail crossed and recrossed the creek.  One lightning flash succeeded
another with such rapidity that the little valley was illuminated
almost to the brightness of day, and the thunder reverberated in one
continuous roar.

With the buildings of Johnson's ranch left safely behind, Alice's
concern for Endicott's well-being cooled perceptibly.

"He needn't to have been so hateful, just because I laughed at him,"
she thought, and winced at a lightning flash.  Her lips pressed
tighter.  "I hate thunder-storms--to be out in them.  I bet we'll all
be soaked and--"  There was a blinding flash of light, the whole valley
seemed filled with a writhing, twisting rope of white fire, and the
deafening roar of thunder that came simultaneously with the flash made
the ground tremble.  It was as though the world had exploded beneath
their feet, and directly in the forefront the girl saw a tall dead
cottonwood split in half and topple sidewise.  And in the same instant
she caught a glimpse of Endicott's face.  It was very white.  "He's
afraid," she gritted, and at the thought her own fear vanished, and in
its place came a wild spirit of exhilaration.  This was life.  Life in
the raw of which she had read and dreamed but never before experienced.
Her horse stopped abruptly.  The Texan had dismounted and was pulling
at the huge fragment of riven trunk that barred the trail.

"We'll have to lead 'em around through the brush, there.  We can't
budge this boy."

Scattering rain-drops fell--huge drops that landed with a thud and
splashed broadly.

"Get out the slickers, Bat.  Quick now, or we're in for a wettin'."  As
he spoke the man stepped to Alice's side, helped her to the ground, and
loosened the pack-strings of her saddle.  A moment later he held a huge
oilskin of brilliant yellow, into the sleeves of which the girl thrust
her arms.  There was an odour as of burning sulphur and she sniffed the
air as she buttoned the garment about her throat.

The Texan grinned: "Plenty close enough I'll say, when you get a whiff
of the hell-fire.  Better wait here 'til I find a way through the
brush.  An' keep out of reach of the horse's heels with that slicker
on.  You can't never trust a cayuse, 'specially when they can't more'n
half see.  They're liable to take a crack at you for luck."

Grasping his bridle reins the Texan disappeared and by the lightning
flashes she could see him forcing his way through the thicket of
willows.  The scattering drops changed to a heavy downpour.  The
moonlight had long since been obliterated and the short intervals
between the lightning flashes were spaces of intense blackness.  A
yellow-clad figure scrambled over the tree trunk and the cowboy took
the bridle reins from her hand.

"You slip through here.  I'll take your horse around."

On the other side, the cowboy assisted her to mount, and pulling his
horse in beside hers, led off down the trail.  The rain steadily
increased in volume until the flashes of lightning showed only a grey
wall of water, and the roar of it blended into the incessant roar of
the thunder.  The horses splashed into the creek and wallowed to their
bellies in the swirling water.

The Texan leaned close and shouted to make himself heard.

"They don't make 'em any worse than this.  I've be'n out in some
considerable rainstorms, take it first an' last, but I never seen it
come down solid before.  A fish could swim anywheres through this."

"The creek is rising," answered the girl.

"Yes, an' we ain't goin' to cross it many more times.  In the canyon
she'll be belly-deep to a giraffe, an' we got to figure a way out of
the coulee 'fore we get to it."

Alice was straining her ears to catch his words, when suddenly, above
the sound of his voice, above the roar of the rain and the crash and
roll of thunder, came another sound--a low, sullen growl--indefinable,
ominous, terrible.  The Texan, too, heard the sound and, jerking his
horse to a standstill, sat listening.  The sullen growl deepened into a
loud rumble, indescribably horrible.  Alice saw that the Texan's face
was drawn into a tense, puzzled frown.  A sudden fear gripped her
heart.  She leaned forward and the words fairly shrieked from her lips.

"It's the reservoir!"

The Texan whirled to face the others whose horses had crowded close and
stood with drooping heads.

"The reservoir's let go!" he shouted, and pointed into the grey wall of
water at right angles to their course.  "Ride!  Ride like hell an' save
yourselves!  I'll look after her!"  The next instant he whirled his
horse against the girl's.

"Ride straight ahead!" he roared.  "Give him his head an' hang on!
I'll stay at his flank, an' if you go down we'll take a chance
together!"

Slipping the quirt from the horn of his saddle the cowboy brought it
down across her horse's flank and the animal shot away straight into
the opaque grey wall.  Alice gave the horse a loose rein, set her lips,
and gripped the horn of her saddle as the brute plunged on.

The valley was not wide.  They had reached a point where its sides
narrowed to form the mouth of the canyon.  The pound of the horse's
feet was lost in the titanic bombilation of the elements--the incessant
crash and rumble of thunder and the ever increasing roar of rushing
waters.  At every jump the girl expected her frantic horse to go down,
yet she was conscious of no feeling of fear.  She glanced over her
shoulder, but the terrific downpour acted as a curtain through which
her eyes could not penetrate with the aid even of the most vivid
flashes of lightning.  Yet she knew that the Texan rode at her flank
and that the others followed--Endicott and Bat, with his pack-horse
close-snubbed to his saddle-horn.  Suddenly the girl felt her horse
labouring.  His speed slackened perceptibly.  As abruptly as it started
the rain stopped; and she saw that water was swirling about his knees.
Saw also by the aid of a lightning flash that throughout its width the
valley was a black sea of tossing water.  Before her the bank was very
close and she jerked her horse toward a point where the perpendicular
sides of a cutbank gave place to a narrow plane that slanted steeply
upward.  It seemed to the girl that the steep ascent would be
impossible for the horses but it was the only chance.  She glanced
backward.  The Texan was close behind, and following him were the
others, their horses wallowing to their bellies.  She had reached the
hill and so steep was its pitch that her horse seemed perpendicular to
the earth's surface.  She leaned over the horn and twisted her fingers
into his mane as the animal, his feet clear of the water, clawed and
scrambled like a cat to gain the top.  Another moment and he had pulled
himself over the edge and the girl leaped to the ground.  The Texan had
not followed to the top but had halted his horse at the edge of the
water that was mounting steadily higher.  Bat swung in with his pack
horse and with his quirt Tex forced them up the embankment.  Endicott's
horse was all but swimming.  The water came above the man's knees as
the animal fought for footing.  The Texan leaned far out and, grasping
the bridle, drew him in to the bank and quirted him to the top.  Then,
as the three watched, he headed his own horse upward.  Scarcely had the
animal come clear of the water when the eager watchers saw that
something was wrong.

"De cinch--she bus'!" cried the half-breed excitedly.  "Dat dam' Purdy
cut de cinch an' A'm trade Tex mine for ride de outlaw, an' we trade
back.  _Voila_!"  As the man talked, he jerked the coiled rope from his
saddle and rushed to the edge.  Alice, too, crowded to the bank, her
hands tight clenched as she saw the man, the saddle gone from under
him, clinging desperately to the bridle reins, his body awash in the
black waters.  Saw also that his weight on the horse's head was causing
the animal to quit the straight climb and to plunge and turn
erratically.  It was evident that both horse and rider must be hurled
into the flood.  The fury of the storm had passed.  The rumble of
thunder was distant now.  The flashes of lightning came at greater
intervals, and with a pale glow instead of the dazzling brilliance of
the nearer flashes.  Through a great rift in the cloud-bank the moon
showed, calm and serene above the mad rush of black waters.

For a single instant Alice gazed into the up-turned face of the Texan,
and in that instant she saw his lips curve into the familiar cynical
smile.  Then he calmly let go the reins and slipped silently beneath
the black water, as the released horse scrambled to the top.  Beside
her, Endicott uttered an oath and, tearing at the buttons of his
slicker, dashed the garment to the ground.  His coat followed, and
stooping he tore the shoes from his feet and poised on the very edge of
the flood.  With a cry she sprang to his side and gripped his arm, but
without a word he shook her roughly away, and as a dark form appeared
momentarily upon the surface of the flood he plunged in.

Alice and Bat watched as the moonlight showed the man swimming with
strong, sure strokes toward the spot where a moment before the dark
form had appeared upon the surface.  Then he dived, and the
swift-rushing water purled and gurgled as it closed over the spot where
he had been.  Rope in hand, Bat, closely followed by the girl, ran
along the edge of the bank, both straining their eyes for the first
sign of movement upon the surface of the flood.  Would he never come
up?  The slope up which the horses had scrambled steepened into a
perpendicular cut-bank at no great distance below, and if the current
bore the two men past that point the girl knew instinctively that
rescue would be impossible and they would be swept into the vortex of
the canyon.

There was a cry from Bat, and Alice, struggling to keep up, caught a
blur of motion upon the surface some distance below.  A few steps
brought them opposite to the point, where, scarcely thirty feet from
the bank, two forms were struggling violently.  Suddenly an arm raised
high, and a doubled fist crashed squarely against the jaw of a white,
upturned face.  The half-breed poised an instant and threw his rope.
The wide loop fell true and a moment later Endicott succeeded in
passing it under the arms of the unconscious Texan.  Then the rope drew
taut and the halfbreed braced to the pull as the men were forced
shoreward by the current.

With a cry of relief, Alice rushed to the aid of the half-breed, and
grasping the rope, threw her weight into the pull.  But her relief was
short-lived, for when the forms in the water touched shore it was to
brush against the side of the cut-bank with tea feet of perpendicular
wall above them.  And worse than, that, unhardened to the wear of
water, the bank was caving off in great chunks as the current gnawed at
its base.  A section weighing tons let go with a roar only a few yards
below, and Bat and the girl worked as neither had ever worked before to
tow their burden upstream to the sloping bank.  But the force of the
current and the conformation of the bank, which slanted outward at an
angle that diminished the force of the pull by half, rendered their
efforts in vain.

"You stan' back!" ordered Bat sharply, as a section of earth gave way
almost beneath their feet, but the girl paid no attention, and the two
redoubled their efforts.

In the water, Endicott took in the situation at a glance.  He realized
that the strain of the pull was more than the two could overcome.
Realized also that each moment added to the Jeopardy of the half-breed
and the girl.  There was one chance--and only one.  Relieved of his
weight, the unresisting form of the Texan could be dragged to
safety--and he would take that chance.

"_Non_!  _Non_!"  The words were fairly hurled from the half-breed's
lips, as he seemed to divine what was passing in Endicott's mind.  But
Endicott gave no heed.  Deliberately he let go the rope and the next
moment was whirled from sight, straight toward the seething vortex of
the canyon, where the moonlight revealed dimly in the distance only a
wild rush of lashing waters and the thrashing limbs of uprooted trees.


CHAPTER XII

TEX DOES SOME SCOUTING

The moon hung low over the peaks to the westward when the Texan opened
his eyes.  For some moments he stared about him in bewilderment, his
gaze travelling slowly from the slicker-clad form of the girl, who sat
close beside him with her face buried in her arms, to the little group
of horses that stood huddled dejectedly together.  With an effort he
struggled to his elbow, and at the movement, the girl raised her head
and turned a very white face toward him.

Shivering with cold, the Texan raised himself to a sitting posture.
"Where's Bat?" he asked.  "An' why ain't he onsaddled those horses, an'
built a fire?  I'm froze stiff."

"Bat has gone to--to find Winthrop," answered the girl, with a painful
catch in her voice.  "He wouldn't wait, and I had no matches, and yours
were all wet, and I couldn't loosen the cinches."

Tex passed his hand over his forehead, as if trying to remember, and
his fingers prodded tenderly at his jaw.  "I recollect bein' in the
water, an' the pilgrim was there, an' we were scrappin' an' he punched
me in the jaw.  He carries a whallop up his sleeve like the kick of a
mule.  But what we was scrappin' about, an' where he is now, an' how I
come here, is somethin' I don't savvy."

Step by step the girl detailed what had happened while the Texan
listened in silence.  "And now," she concluded, "he's gone.  Just
when--" her voice broke and once more she buried her face in her arms.
Tex saw that she was sobbing silently.  He felt for his "makings" and
drew from his pocket a little sack of soggy tobacco and some wet
papers.  He returned them to his pocket and rose to his feet.

"You're cold," he said softly.  "There's dry matches in the pack.  I'll
make a fire an' get those wet saddles off the horses."

Alice did not look up and the man busied himself with the pack.  A few
minutes later she felt his fingers upon her shoulder.  He pointed
toward a fire that crackled cheerfully from the depths of a bull pine
thicket.  "I fixed you up a shelter tent and spread your blankets.  The
tarp kep' 'em tolerable dry.  Go over there an' get off those clothes.
You must be wet through--nothin' short of a divin' suit would have kep'
that rain out!"

"But----"

He forestalled the objection.  "There won't be any one to bother you.
I'm goin' down the creek."

The girl noticed that his horse, saddled with Endicott's saddle stood
close behind her.

"I didn't mean that!" she exclaimed.  "But you are cold--chilled to the
bone.  You need the fire more than I do."

The man shook his head: "I'll be goin' now," he said.  "You'd better
make you some coffee."

"You're going to--to----"

Tex nodded: "Yes.  To find the pilgrim.  If he's alive I'll find him.
An' if he ain't I'll find him.  An' when I do, I'll bring him back to
you."  He turned abruptly, swung onto his horse, and Alice watched him
as he disappeared down the valley, keeping to the higher ground.  Not
until she was alone did the girl realize how miserably cold and
uncomfortable she was.  She rose stiffly, and walking slowly to the
edge of the bank, looked out over the little valley.  The great
reservoir had run out in that first wild rush of water and now the last
rays of moonlight showed only wide, glistening pools, and the creek
subsided to nearly its normal proportions.  With a shudder she turned
toward the fire.  Its warmth felt grateful.  She removed the slicker
and riding costume and, wrapping herself, squaw-like, in a blanket, sat
down in the little shelter tent.  She found that the Texan had filled
the coffee pot and, throwing in some coffee, she set it to boil.

"He's so thoughtful, and self-reliant, and--and competent," she
murmured.  "And he's brave, and--and picturesque.  Winthrop is brave,
too--just as brave as he is, but--he isn't a bit picturesque."  She
relapsed into silence as she rummaged in the bag for a cup, and the
sugar, and a can of milk.  The moon sank behind the ridge and the girl
replenished her fire from the pile of wood the Texan had left within
reach of her hand.  She drank her coffee and her eyes sought to
penetrate the blackness beyond the firelight.  Somewhere out there in
the dark--she shuddered as she attempted to visualize _what_ was
somewhere out there in the dark.  And then a flash of memory brought
with it a ray of hope that cheered her immeasurably.  "Why, he was a
champion swimmer in college," she said aloud.  "He was always winning
cups and things.  And he's strong, and brave--and yet----"  Vividly to
her mind came the picture of the wildly rushing flood with its burden
of tossing trees, and the man being swept straight into the gurge of
it.  "I'll tell him he's brave--and he'll spoil it all by saying that
it was the only _practical_ thing to do."  "Oh," she cried aloud, "I
could love him if it were not for his deadly practicability--even if I
should have to live in Cincinnati."  And straightway fell to comparing
the two men.  "Tex is absurdly unconventional in speech and actions,
and he has an adorable disregard for laws and things.  He's just a big,
irresponsible boy--and yet, he makes you feel as if he always knew
exactly what to do and how to do it.  And he is brave, too, with a
reckless, devil-may-care sort of bravery that takes no thought of cost
or consequences.  He knew, when he let go his bridle reins, that he
couldn't swim a stroke--and he smiled and didn't care.  And he's gentle
and considerate, too."  She remembered the look in his eyes when he
said: "You are cold," and blushed furiously.

It seemed hours she sat there staring into the little fire and
listening for sounds from the dark.  But the only sounds that came to
her were the sounds of the feeding horses, and in utter weariness she
lay back with her head upon a folded blanket, and slept.

When the Texan swung onto his horse after having made the girl
comfortable for her long vigil, a scant half-hour of moonlight was left
to him.  He gave the horse his head and the animal picked his way among
the loose rocks and scrub timber that capped the ridge.  When darkness
overtook him he dismounted, unsaddled, and groped about for firewood.
Despite its recent soaking the resinous bull pine flared up at the
touch of a match, and with his back to a rock-wall, the cowboy sat and
watched the little flames shoot upward.  Once more he felt for his
"makings" and with infinite pains dried out his papers and tobacco.

"It's the chance I be'n aimin' to make for myself," he mused, as he
drew the grey smoke of a cigarette deep into his lungs, "to get Bat an'
the pilgrim away--an' I ride off and leave it."  The cigarette was
consumed and he rolled another.  "Takin' a slant at himself from the
inside, a man kind of gets a line on how damned ornery folks can get.
Purdy got shot, an' everyone said he got just what was comin' to
him----  Me, an' everyone else--an' he did.  But when you get down to
cases, he wasn't no hell of a lot worse'n me, at that.  We was both
after the same thing--only his work was coarser."  For hours the man
sat staring into his fire, the while he rolled and smoked many
cigarettes.

"Oh, hell!" he exclaimed, aloud.  "I can't turn nester, an' even if I
did, she couldn't live out in no mud-roof shack in the bottom of some
coulee!  Still, she----  There I go again, over the same old trail.
This here little girl has sure gone to my head--like a couple of jolts
of hundred-proof on an empty stummick.  Anyhow, she's a damn sight
safer'n ever she was before, an'--I'll bet the old man _would_ let me
take that Eagle Creek ranch off his hands, an' stake me to a little
bunch of stock besides, if I went at him right.  If it wasn't for that
damn pilgrim!  Bat was right.  He holds the edge on me--but he's a
man."  The cowboy glanced anxiously toward the east where the sky was
beginning to lighten with the first hint of dawn.  He rose, trampled
out his fire, and threw the saddle onto his horse.  "I've got to find
him," he muttered, "if Bat ain't found him already.  I don't know much
about this swimmin' business but if he could have got holt of a tree or
somethin' he might have made her through."

Now riding, now dismounting to lead his horse over some particularly
rough outcropping of rocks, or through an almost impenetrable tangle of
scrub, the man made his way over the divide and came down into the
valley amid a shower of loose rock and gravel, at a point some distance
below the lower end of the canyon.

The mountains were behind him.  Only an occasional butte reared its
head above the sea of low foothills that stretched away into the bad
lands to the southward.  The sides of the valley flattened and became
ill-defined.  Low ridges and sage-topped foothills broke up its
continuity, so that the little creek that started so bravely from the
mountains ended nowhere, its waters being sucked in by the parched and
thirsting alkali soil long before it reached the bad lands.

As his horse toiled ankle-deep in the soft whitish mud, Tex's eyes
roved over the broadened expanse of the valley.  Everywhere were
evidences of the destructive force of the flood.  Uprooted trees
scattered singly and in groups, high-flung masses of brush, hay, and
inextricably tangled barbed-wire from which dangled fence-posts marked
every bend of the creek bed.  And on every hand the bodies of drowned
cattle dotted the valley.

"If I was Johnson," he mused, as his eyes swept the valley, "I'd head a
right smart of ranch hands down here heeled with a spade an' a sexton's
commission.  These here late lamented dogies'll cost him somethin' in
damages."  From force of habit the man read the brands of the dead
cattle as he rode slowly down the valley.  "D bar C, that's old Dave
Cromley's steer.  An' there's a T U, an' an I X cow, an' there's one of
Charlie Green's, an' a yearlin' of Jerry Keerful's, an' a
quarter-circle M,--that belongs over the other side, they don't need to
bother with that one, an' there's a----"

Suddenly he drew himself erect, and rising to stand in the stirrups,
gazed long and intently toward a spot a quarter of a mile below, where
a thin column of smoke curled over the crest of a low ridge.  Abruptly
he lost interest in the brands of dead cattle and headed his horse at a
run toward a coulee, that gave between two sage covered foothills only
a short distance from the faint column of smoke.  "That might be Bat,
an' then again it mightn't," he muttered.  "It can't be the pilgrim
without Bat's along, 'cause he wouldn't have no dry matches.  An' if
it's any one else--" he drew up sharply in the shelter of a thicket,
dismounted, and made his way on foot to the summit of the ridge.
Removing his hat, he thrust his head through a narrow opening between
two sage bushes, and peered into the hollow beyond.  Beside a little
fire sat Bat and the pilgrim, the latter arrayed in a suit of underwear
much abbreviated as to arms and legs, while from the branches of a
broken tree-top drawn close beside the blaze depended a pair of
mud-caked trousers and a disreputably dirty silk shirt.  The Texan
picked his way down the hill, slipping and sliding in the soft mud.

"Breakfast about ready?" he asked, with a grin.

"Breakfas'!  _Voila_!  A'm lak' A'm got som' breakfas', you bet!
Me--A'm gon' for cut de chonk of meat out de dead steer but de pilgrim
say: '_Non_, dat bes' we don' eat de damn drownded cattle--dat better
we sta've firs'!"

Tex laughed: "Can't stand for the drownded ones, eh?  Well I don't know
as I blame you none, they might be some soggy."  Reaching into his
shirt-front he produced a salt bag which he tossed to Endicott.
"Here's some sinkers I fetched along.  Divide 'em up.  I've et.  It
ain't no great ways back to camp----"

"How is she--Miss Marcum?  Did she suffer from the shock?"

"Nary suffer.  I fixed her up a camp last night back in the timber
where we all landed, an' then came away."

"She spent the night alone in the timber!" cried Endicott.

The Texan nodded.  "Yes.  There ain't nothin' will bother her.  I
judged it to be the best way."  Endicott's hand shot out and the
cowboy's met it in a firm grip.  "I reckon we're fifty-fifty on that,"
he said gravely.  "How's the swimmin'?"

Endicott laughed: "Fine--only I didn't have to do a great deal of it.
In one corner of the living room is a box containing blankets, above
which are pillows and mats used by members of the household and guests;
an iron caldron lies on the floor, while numerous Chinese jars stand
about. A hearth, made up of a bed of ashes in which stones are sunk,
is used for cooking. Above it is a bamboo food hanger, while near
by stand jars of water and various cooking pots. Food baskets, coconut
shell cups, and dishes, and a quantity of Chinese plates appear when
the meal is served, while the use of glass is not unknown. Cups of
gold, wonderful jars, and plates appear at times, but seem to
be so rare as to excite comment (pp. 33, 98, 102, 105).

Scattered through the village are numerous small buildings known as balaua
(p. 43), which are erected for the spirits during the greatest of the
ceremonies, and still inside the enclosure are the rice drying plots and
granaries, the latter raised high above the ground so as to protect
their contents from moisture (pp. 150).

About the town pigs and chickens roam at will, while half-starved hunting
dogs prowl about below the kitchens and fight for morsels which
drop from above (p. 99).

Carabao are kept and used as food (p. 101), but in the cycle proper no
mention is made of using them as work animals. [9] Game,
especially deer and wild chickens, and fish are added to the domestic
supply of food (p. 80), but the staple appears to be mountain rice.

Beans, coconuts, oranzes, sugar cane, betel-nuts, and tobacco are
also cultivated (pp. 33, 107, 121, 138).

Clothing is scanty but nevertheless receives much attention. The poorest
of the men wear clouts of banana leaf, and the women, when in danger
of capture, don skirts of bark; but on most occasions we find the man
wearing a colored cotton clout, above which is a bright belt of the
same material, while for ceremonies he may add a short coat or
jacket.

A headband, sometimes of gold, keeps his long hair in place, and for
very special events he may adorn each hair with a golden bead (pp.
74, 76, 81)
The cotton skirts of the women reach from the waist to the knees;
the arms are covered with strands above strands of beads, while
strings of agate beads surround the neck or help to hold the hair
in place.

To the real hair is often added a switch which appears to be valued
highly (p. 89). Ornaments of gold adorn the ears, and finger rings of
the same metal are several times mentioned (pp. 39, 43, 124).

The tales afford us a glimpse of the daily life. In the early morning
the chilly mountain air drives the people from their mats to the
yard, where they squat about the fires (p. 132).

As it becomes light, part of the women begin pounding out the rice from
its straw and husks (p. 144), while others depart for the springs to
secure water (p. 101). In planting time husband and wife trudge together
to the fields, where the man plants the seeds or cuttings, and his wife
assists by pouring on water (p. 107). In midday, unless it is the
busy season, the village activities are practically suspended,
and we see the balaua filled with men, asleep or lounging, while
children may be playing about with tops or disk-like lipi seeds (p.
139).

As it becomes cooler, the town again takes on life; in the houses the
women weave blankets or prepare food, the older women feed the chickens
and pigs (p. 93), while the workers from the fields, or hunters with
their dogs and game, add to the general din and excitement (p. 80).
When night comes on, if it be in the dry season, bonfires spring up
in different parts of the village, and about them the girls and women
gather to spin. Here also come the men and boys, to lounge and talk (p.
117). A considerable portion of the man's time is taken up in preparation
for or actual participation in warfare (p. 74). We have already
seen that the constant danger of enemies makes it advisable for the
women to go in parties, even to the village spring. One tale informs
us of a girl who is left alone to guard the rice field and is promptly
killed by the alzado; [10] another states that "all the tattooed Igorot
are enemies" (pp. 43, 155, 161).

Revenge for the loss of relations or townspeople is a potent cause of
hostile raids; old feuds may be revived by taunts; but the chief
incentive appears to be the desire for renown, to be known as "a
man who goes to fight in the enemies' towns" (pp. 90, 59).

Warriors sometimes go in parties, sometimes alone, but generally in
couples (p. 67). At times they lie in ambush and kill young girls who
go for water, or old men and women who pass their hiding place (p.
97). Again they go out boldly, armed with shield, spear, and headaxe;
they strike their shields as they go and announce their presence
to the enemy (p. 103). In five of the tales the heroes challenge their
opponents and then refuse to be the first to use their weapons. It is
only when their foes have tried in vain to injure them that they enter
the conflict. In such cases whole towns are wiped out of existence and
a great number of heads and a quantity of jars and other booty is sent
back to the towns of the victors (p. 104). Peace is restored in one
instance by the payment of a number of valuable jars (p. 91).

Upon the return of a successful war party, the relatives meet them at the
gate of the town and compel them to climb the sangap; [11] then
invitations are sent out to friends and relatives in neighboring
towns to come and aid in the celebration of the victory (p. 140).

When they arrive at the entrance of the village they are met by the
townspeople, who offer them liquor and then conduct them to the
houses where they feast and dance to the music of gansas (p. 126).
[12] Finally the captured heads are stuck on the sagang [13] and
are placed by the gate, the spring, and, if sufficient in number,
surround the town (p. 140).

Taking the heads of one's neighbors does not appear to be common,
yet cases are mentioned where visitors are treacherously killed at
a dance (pp. 78, 83).

The use of poison [14] is twice mentioned. In one case the victims are
killed by drinking liquor furnished by the father of the girl
about whose head they are dancing (pp. 148, 156).

Bamboo spears appear to be used, but we are explicitly told that they
fought with steel weapons, and there are frequent references to head-axes,
spears, and knives (pp. 65, 76, 120).

Marriage appears generally to be negotiated by the mother of the
youth at his suggestion (p. 128). At times both his parents go to the
girl's home, and after many preliminaries broach the subject of their
mission (p. 128). The girl's people discuss the proposition, and
if they are favorable they set a day for the pakálon--a celebration
at which the price to be paid for the bride is decided upon (p. 49).
The parents of the groom then return home after having left some
small present, such as a jar or an agate bead, as a sign of
engagement (p. 128). [15] The pakálon is held a few days later at
the girl's home, and for this event her people prepare a quantity
of food (p. 72).

On the agreed day the close friends and relatives of both families will
assemble. Those who accompany the groom carry jars and pigs, either
in part payment for the bride, or to serve as food for the company (pp.
72, 128). The first hours are spent in bargaining over the price the
girl should bring, but when this is settled a feast is prepared, and
then all indulge in dancing the tadek (p. 59). [16] When the payment
is made a portion is distributed among the girl's relatives (pp.
72, 74), but her parents retain the greater part for themselves.
[17] The groom cannot yet claim his bride, although in one case he
is allowed to take her immediately after the pakálon by making a
special payment for the privilege (p. 74).

A few nights later the groom goes to the girl's home carrying with
him an empty jar with which he makes the final payment (p. 73).

The customary rice ceremony [18] follows and he is then entitled to his
bride (p. 73). Should the house or anything in it break at this time,
it foretells misfortune for the couple, hence precautions are taken
lest such a sign should, by accident, be given (p. 60).

In all but two cases mentioned the girl and her husband go to live with
his people.

In the first instance their failure to do so raises a protest; in
the second, the girl's parents are of much more importance than
those of the groom, and this may explain their ability to retain
their daughter (pp. 138, 159).

When the bride reaches her future home, she sits on the bamboo floor
with her legs stretched out in front of her.

The slats which she covers are counted and a string of agate beads,
equal in length to the combined width of the slats, is given to her.

She now becomes a full member of the family and seems to be under
the orders of her mother-in-law (p. 60).

The tales give constant sanction for the marriage of near relatives.
Dumanau, we are told, marries his cousin, [19] while we frequently
meet with such statements as, "We are relatives and it is good for us
to be married," or "They saw that they were related and that both
possessed magical power, so they were married (p. 35)."

It appears that a man may live with his sweetheart and have children
by her, yet leave her, and, without reproach, marry another better
fitted to be his wife (p. 54).

He may also accept payment for a wife who has deserted him, apparently
without loss of prestige (p. 64). No objection seems to be raised
to a man having two wives so long as one of these is an inhabitant
of the upper world (p. 111), but we find Kanag telling his former
sweetheart that he cannot marry her since he is now married to
another (p. 138).

Again, when two women lay claim to Aponitolau, as their husband, they
undergo a test and the loser returns to her former home (p. 94).

However, this rule does not prevent a man from having several concubines
(p., 120). Gawigawen, we are told, is accompanied to a pakálon by eighteen
young girls who are his concubines (p. 59).

Divorce is twice mentioned, but it seems to call out protest
only from the cast off wife (pp. 63, 149).

Closely associated with the celebration of a marriage seems to be a
ceremony known as Sayang, during the progress of which a number of
small structures--the largest known as balaua--are built. Judging
by their names and descriptions, we are justified in considering them
"spirit houses" as they are to-day.

The details of the extended Sayang ceremony are nowhere given, but so
much is made plain:--At its beginning many people pound rice, for
use in the offerings and for food, and da-eng [20] is danced (p.
40).

After the Libon [21] invitations are sent out, by means of betel-nuts
covered with gold, to those whose presence is especially desired
(p. 62).

When the guests arrive at the village spring or gate they are offered
food or drink, and then while they dance they are sprinkled with
water or rice, after which all go up to the town (p. 41 note 2).

A medium who knows the customs and desires of the spirits constructs
a bamboo mat, which is known as talapitap, and on it offers food.

To call their attention she frequently strikes the ground with the
dakidak--split sticks of bamboo and lono [22] (p. 40).

The guests are not neglected, so far as regards food, for feasting and
dancing occupy a considerable portion of their time.

The ceremonial dance da-eng is mentioned, but the tadek [23] seems to be
the one in special favor (pp. 41, 59).

One tale tells us that the Sayang was held immediately following a
head hunt; and another, that Aponitolau went out to get the head
of an old man before he started this ceremony (pp. 69, 76); however,
the evidence is by no means conclusive that it is related to
warfare.

On page 105 we are told that Kanag's half sister is a medium, and the
description of her method of summoning the spirits tallies with
that of to-day.

At the Sayang ceremony she is called to perform the Dawak, [24] with the
assistance of the old woman Alokotán (p. 106). The Dawak is also held
in order to stop the flow of blood from Aponitolau's finger (p. 113).
The only other ceremony mentioned is that made in order to find a
lost switch (p. 91).

Certain well-known customs are strongly brought out in our material. The
first, and apparently most important, is the necessity of offering
liquor and food, both to strangers and to guests (p. 58).

Refusal is so keenly resented that in one instance a couple decline to
allow their daughter to marry a man whose emissaries reject this
gift (p. 73).

Old quarrels are closed by the tender of food or drink, and friendships
are cemented by the drinking of basi [25] (p. 134). People meeting
for the first time, and even friends who have been separated for a
while, chew betel-nut together and tell their names and places of
residence.

We are repeatedly told that it is necessary to chew the nut and make
known their names, for "we cannot tell our names unless we chew,"
and "it is bad for us if we do not know each other's names when we
talk."

A certain etiquette is followed at this time: old men precede the younger;
people of the home town, the visitors; and men always are before
the women (pp. 45, 133).

The conduct of Awig when he serves liquor to the alzados [26] is that
of to-day, i.e., the person who serves always drinks before passing
it to others (p. 156).

Certain other rules of etiquette or restrictions on conduct come
out in the tales.

We learn that it is not considered proper for a man to eat with the
wife of another during his absence, nor should they start the meal
before he comes in (p. 52).

The master of a dance is deeply chagrined and chides his wife
severely, because she insists on dancing before he has invited all
the others to take their turns (p. 70).

Greediness is reproved in children and Aponitolau causes the death of
his concubines whose false tales had led him to maltreat his wife
(p. 116).

Unfaithfulness seems to be sufficient justification for a man to
abandon his wife and kill her admirer (p. 78); but Kanag appears as a
hero when he refuses to attack his father who has sought his life (p.
121).

Of the ceremonies connected with death we learn very little except that
the women discard their arm beads, the mourners don old clothing, and
all wail for the dead (pp. 44, 90). Three times we are told that
the deceased is placed on a tabalang, or raft, on which a live
rooster is fastened before it is set adrift on the river.

In the tales the raft and fowl are of gold, but this is surprising
even to the old woman Alokotán, past whose home in Nagbotobotán all
these rafts must go (p. 131).

Up to this time in our reconstruction of the life of "the first times"
we have mentioned nothing impossible or improbable to the present
day Tinguian, although, as we shall see later, there are some
striking differences in customs and ideas.

We have purposely left the description of the people and their practice
of magic to the last, although their magical practices invade every
activity of their lives, for it is here that the greatest variations
from present conditions apparently occur.

These people had intimate relations with some of the lesser spirits,
especially with the liblibayan, [27] who appear to be little more
than their servants, with the evil spirits known as banbanáyo,
[28] and with the alan [29] (p. 123).

Tex carried
the outfit he had procured from Johnson into the timber, then crawled
cautiously to the pilgrim's side, and awoke him without arousing the
others.

"Hey, Win, wake up," he whispered as the man regarded him through a
pair of sleepy eyes.  "Come on with me.  I got somethin' to show you."
Tex led the way to the war-bag.  "Them clothes of yourn is plum
despisable to look at," he imparted, "so I borrowed an outfit offen a
friend of mine that's about your size.  Just crawl into 'em an' see how
they fit."

Five minutes later the cowboy viewed with approval the figure that
stood before him, booted and spurred, with his mud-caked garments
replaced by corduroy trousers and a shirt of blue flannel against which
the red silk muffler made a splotch of vivid colouring.

"You look like a sure enough top hand, now," grinned the Texan.  "We'll
just take a drink on that."  He drew the cork from the bottle and
tendered it to Endicott, who shook his head.

"No, thanks.  I never use it."

The Texan stared at him in surprise.  "Do you mean you've got the
regular habit of not drinkin', or is it only a temporary lapse of duty?"

Endicott laughed: "Regular habit," he answered.

The other drank deeply of the liquor and returned the cork.  "You ought
to break yourself of that habit, Win, there's no tellin' where it'll
lead to.  A fellow insulted me once when I was sober an' I never
noticed it.  But laying aside your moral defects, them whiskers of
yourn is sure onornamental to a scandalous degree.  Wait, I'll fetch my
razor, an' you can mow 'em."  He disappeared, to return a few moments
later with a razor, a cake of hand-soap, and a shaving brush.

"I never have shaved my self," admitted Endicott, eyeing the articles
dubiously.

"Who have you shaved?"

"I mean, I have always been shaved by a barber."

"Oh!"  The cowboy took another long pull at the bottle.  "Well, Win,
the fact is them whiskers looks like hell an' has got to come off."  He
rolled up his sleeves.  "I ain't no barber, an' never shaved a man in
my life, except myself, but I'm willin' to take a chance.  After what
you've done for me I'd be a damn coward not to risk it.  Wait now 'til
I get another drink an' I'll tackle the job an' get it over with.  A
man can't never tell what he can do 'til he tries."

Endicott viewed the cowboy's enthusiasm with alarm.  "That's just what
I was thinking, Tex," he hastened to say, as the other drew the cork
from the bottle.  "And it is high time I learned to shave myself,
anyway.  I have never been where it was necessary before.  If you will
just sit there and tell me how, I will begin right now."

"Alright, Win, you can't never learn any younger.  First off, you wet
your face in the creek an' then soap it good.  That soap ain't regular
shavin' soap, but it'll do.  Then you take the brush an' work it into a
lather, an' then you shave."

"But," inquired the man dubiously, "don't you have towels soaked in hot
water, and----"

"Towels an' hot water, hell!  This ain't no barber shop, an' there
ain't no gin, or whatever they rub on your face after you get through,
either.  You just shave an' knock the soap off your ears an' that's all
there is to it."

After much effort Endicott succeeded in smearing his face with a thin,
stringy lather, and gingerly picked up the razor.  The Texan looked on
in owlish solemnity as the man sat holding the blade helplessly.

"What you doin', Win, sayin' the blessin'?  Just whet her on your boot
an' sail in."

"But where do I begin?"

The Texan snorted disgustedly.  "Your face ain't so damn big but what
an hour or two reminiscence ought to take you back to where it starts.
Begin at your hat an' work down over your jaw 'til you come to your
shirt, an' the same on the other side, takin' in your lip an' chin in
transit, as the feller says.  An' hold it like a razor, an' not like a
pitchfork.  Now you got to lather all over again, 'cause it's dry."

Once more Endicott laboriously coaxed a thin lather out of the brown
hand-soap, and again he grasped the razor, this time with a do-or-die
determination.

"Oughtn't I have a mirror?" he asked doubtfully.

"A mirror!  Don't you know where your own face is at?  You don't need
no mirror to eat with, do you?  Well, it's the same way with shavin'.
But if you got to have ocular evidence, just hang out over the creek
there where it's still."

The operation was slow and painful.  It seemed to Endicott as though
each separate hair were being dragged out by its roots, and more than
once the razor edge drew blood.  At last the job was finished, he
bathed his smarting face in the cold water, and turned to the Texan for
approval.

"You look like the second best bet in a two-handed cat fight," he
opined, and producing his book of cigarette papers, proceeded to stick
patches of tissue over various cuts and gashes.  "Takin' it by an'
large, though, it ain't so bad.  There's about as many places where you
didn't go close enough as there is where you went too close, so's it'll
average somewhere around the skin level.  Anyway it shows you tried to
look respectable--an' you do, from your neck down--an' your hat, too."

"I am certainly obliged to you," laughed Endicott, "for going to all
that trouble to provide me with clothing.  And by the way, did you
learn anything--in regard to posses, I mean?"

The Texan nodded sombrely: "Yep.  I did.  This here friend of mine was
on his way back from Wolf River when I met up with him.  'Tex,' he
says, 'where's the pilgrim?'  I remains noncommital, an' he continues,
'I layed over yesterday to enjoy Purdy's funeral, which it was the
biggest one ever pulled off in Wolf River--not that any one give a damn
about Purdy, but they've drug politics into it, an' furthermore, his'n
was the only corpse to show for the whole celebration, it bein' plumb
devoid of further casualties.'"  The cowpuncher paused, referred to his
bottle, and continued: "It's just like I told you before.  There can't
no one's election get predjudiced by hangin' you, an' they've made a
kind of issue out of it.  There's four candidates for sheriff this fall
an' folks has kind of let it be known, sub rosy, that the one that
brings you in, gathers the votes.  In the absence of any corpse
delecti, which in this case means yourn, folks refuses to assume you
was hung, so each one of them four candidates is right now scouring the
country with a posse.  All this he imparts to me while he was throwin'
that outfit of clothes together an' further he adds that I'm under
suspicion for aidin' an' abettin', an' that means life with hard labour
if I'm caught with the goods--an', Win, you're the goods.  Therefore,
you'll confer a favour on me by not getting caught, an' incidentally
save yourself a hangin'.  Once we get into the bad lands we're all to
the good, but even then you've got to keep shy of folks.  Duck out of
sight when you first see any one.  Don't have nothin' to say to no one
under no circumstances.  If you do chance onto someone where you can't
do nothin' else you'll have to lie to 'em.  Personal, I don't favour
lyin' only as a last resort, an' then in moderation.  Of course, down
in the bad lands, most of the folks will be on the run like we are, an'
not no more anxious for to hold a caucus than us.  You don't have to be
so particular there, 'cause likely all they'll do when they run onto
you will be to take a shot at you, an' beat it.  We've got to lay low
in the bad lands about a week or so, an' after that folks will have
somethin' else on their mind an' we can slip acrost to the N. P."

"See here, Tex, this thing has gone far enough."  There was a note of
determination in Endicott's voice as he continued: "I cannot permit you
to further jeopardize yourself on my account.  You have already
neglected your business, incurred no end of hard work, and risked life,
limb, and freedom to get me out of a scrape.  I fully appreciate that I
am already under heavier obligation to you than I can ever repay.  But
from here on, I am going it alone.  Just indicate the general direction
of the N. P. and I will find it.  I know that you and Bat will see that
Miss Marcum reaches the railway in safety, and----"

"Hold on, Win!  That oration of yourn ain't got us no hell of a ways,
an' already it's wandered about four school-sections off the trail.  In
the first place, it's me an' not you that does the permittin' for this
outfit.  I've undertook to get you acrost to the N. P.  I never started
anythin' yet that I ain't finished.  Take this bottle of _hooch_
here--I've started her, an' I'll finish her.  There's just as much
chance I won't take you acrost to the N. P., as that I won't finish
that bottle--an' that's damn little.

"About neglectin' my business, as you mentioned, that ain't worryin' me
none, because the wagon boss specified particular an' onmistakeable
that if any of us misguided sons of guns didn't show up on the job the
mornin' followin' the dance, we might's well keep on ridin' as far as
that outfit was concerned, so it's undoubtable that the cow business is
bein' carried on satisfactory durin' my temporary absence.

"Concernin' the general direction of the N. P., I'll enlighten you that
if you was to line out straight for Texas, it would be the first
railroad you'd cross.  But you wouldn't never cross it because
interposed between it an' here is a right smart stretch of country
which for want of a worse name is called the bad lands.  They's some
several thousan' square miles in which there's only seven water-holes
that a man can drink out of, an' generally speakin' about five of them
is dry.  There's plenty of water-holes but they're poison.  Some is gyp
an' some is arsnic.  Also these here bad lands ain't laid out on no
general plan.  The coulees run hell-west an' crossways at their
littlest end an' wind up in a mud crack.  There ain't no trails, an'
the inhabitants is renegades an' horse-thieves which loves their
solitude to a murderous extent.  If a man ain't acquainted with the
country an' the horse-thieves, an' the water-holes, his sojourn would
be discouragin' an' short.

"All of which circumlocutin' brings us to the main point which is that
_she_ wouldn't stand for no such proceedin'.  As far as I can see that
settles the case.  The pros an' cons that you an' me could set here an'
chew about, bein' merely incidental, irreverent, an' by way of passin'
the time."

Endicott laughed: "You are a philosopher, Tex."

"A cow-hand has got to be."

"But seriously, I could slip away without her knowing it, then the only
thing you could do would be to take her to the railway."

"Yes.  Well, you try that an' you'll find out who's runnin' this
outfit.  I'll trail out after you an' when I catch you, I'll just
naturally knock hell out of you, an' that's all there'll be to it.  You
had the edge on me in the water but you ain't on land.  An' now that's
settled to the satisfaction of all parties concerned, suppose me an'
you slip over to camp an' cook supper so we can pull out right after
sundown."

The two made their way through the timber to find Alice blowing herself
red in the face in a vain effort to coax a blaze out of a few
smouldering coals she had scraped from beneath the ashes of the fire.

"Hold on!" cried the Texan, striding toward her, "I've always
maintained that buildin' fires is a he-chore, like swearin', an'
puttin' the baby to sleep.  So, if you'll just set to one side a minute
while I get this fire a-goin' an' Win fetches some water, you can take
holt an' do the cookin' while we-all get the outfit ready for the
trail."

Something in the man's voice caused the girl to regard him sharply, and
her eyes shifted for a moment to his companion who stood in the
background.  There was no flash of recognition in the glance, and
Endicott, suppressing a laugh, turned his face away, picked up the
water pail, and started toward the creek.

"Who is that man?" asked the girl, a trifle nervously, as he
disappeared from view.

"Who, him?" The Texan was shaving slivers from a bull pine stick.
"He's a friend of mine.  Win's his name, an' barrin' a few little
irregularities of habit, he ain't so bad."  The cowboy burst into
mournful song as he collected his shavings and laid them upon the coals:

  "It's little Joe, the wrangler, he'll wrangle never more,
  His days with the _remuda_ they are o'er;
  'Twas a year ago last April when he rode into our camp,
  Just a little Texas stray, and all alo-o-o-n-e."

Alice leaned toward the man in sudden anger:

"You've been drinking!" she whispered.

Tex glanced at her in surprise: "That's so," he said, gravely.  "It's
the only way I can get it down."

She was about to retort when Endicott returned from the creek and
placed the water pail beside her.

"Winthrop!" she cried, for the first time recognizing him.  "Where in
the world did you get those clothes, and what is the matter with your
face?"

Endicott grinned: "I shaved myself for the first time."

"What did you do it with, some barbed wire?"

"Looks like somethin' that was left out in the rain an' had started to
peel," ventured the irrepressible Tex.

Alice ignored him completely.  "But the clothes?  Where did you get
them?"

Endicott nodded toward the Texan.  "He loaned them to me!"

"But--surely they would never fit him."

"Didn't know it was necessary they should," drawled Tex, and having
succeeded in building the fire, moved off to help Bat who was busying
himself with the horses.

"Where has he been?" asked the girl as the voice of the Texan came from
beyond the trees:

  "It happened in Jacksboro in the spring of seventy-three,
  A man by the name of Crego come steppin' up to me,
  Sayin', 'How do you do, young fellow, an' how would you like to go
  An' spend one summer pleasantly, on the range of the buffalo-o-o?'"

"I'm sure I don't know.  He came back an hour or so ago and woke me up
and gave me this outfit and told me my whiskers looked like the
infernal regions and that I had better shave--even offered to shave me,
himself."

"But he has been drinking.  Where did he get the liquor?"

"The same place he got the clothes, I guess.  He said he met a friend
and borrowed them," smiled Endicott.

"Well, it's nothing to laugh at.  I should think you'd be ashamed to
stand there and laugh about it."

The man stared at her in surprise.  "I guess he won't drink enough to
hurt him any.  And--why, it was only a day or two ago that you sat in
the dining car and defended their drinking.  You even said, I believe,
that had you been a man you would have been over in the saloon with
them."

"Yes, I did say that!  But that was different.  Oh, I think men are
_disgusting_!  They're either _bad_, or just plain _dumb_!"

  "We left old Crego's bones to bleach on the range of the buffalo--
  Went home to our wives an' sweethearts, told others not to go,
  For God's forsaken the buffalo range, and the damned old buffalo-o-o!"

"At least our friend Tex does not seem to be stricken with dumbness,"
Endicott smiled as the words of the buffalo skinner's song broke forth
anew.  "Do you know I have taken a decided fancy to him.  He's----"

"I'd run along and play with him then if I were you," was the girl's
sarcastic comment.  "Maybe if you learn how to swear and sing some of
his beautiful songs he'll give you part of his whiskey."  She turned
away abruptly and became absorbed in the preparation of supper, and
Endicott, puzzled as he was piqued, at the girl's attitude, joined the
two who were busy with the pack.  "He's just perfectly stunning in that
outfit," thought Alice as she watched him disappear in the timbers.
"Oh, I don't know--sometimes I wish--" but the wish became confused
somehow with the sizzling of bacon.  And with tight-pressed lips, she
got out the tin dishes.

"What's the matter, Win--steal a sheep?" asked the Texan as he paused,
blanket in hand, to regard Endicott.

"What?"

"What did _you_ catch hell for?  You didn't imbibe no embalmin' fluid."
Endicott grinned and the cowboy finished rolling his blanket.

"Seems like we're in bad, some way.  She didn't say nothin' much, but I
managed to gather from the way she looked right through the place where
I was standin' that I could be got along without for a spell.  Her
interruptin' me right in the middle of a song to impart that I'd be'n
drinkin' kind of throw'd me under the impression that the pastime was
frowned on, but the minute I seen you comin' through the brush like you
was sneaking off at recess, I know'd you was included in the boycott
an' that lets the booze out.  Seein's our conscience is clear, it must
be somethin' _she_ done that she's took umbrage at, as the feller says,
an' the best thing we can do is to overlook it.  I don't know as I'd
advise tellin' her so, but we might just kind of blend into the scenery
onobtrusive 'til the thaw comes.  In view of which I'll just take a
little drink an' sing you a song I heard down on the Rio Grande."
Thrusting his arm into the end of his blanket roll, the Texan drew
forth his bottle and, taking a drink, carefully replaced it.  "This
here song is _The Old Chisholm Trail_, an' it goes like this:

  "Come along; boys, and listen to my tale,
  I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm trail.

    Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya, youpy ya,
    Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya.

  I started up the trail October twenty-third,
  I started up the trail with the 2-U herd.

  Oh, a ten dollar hoss and a forty dollar saddle--
  And I'm goin' to punchin' Texas cattle.

  I woke up one morning on the old Chisholm trail,
  Rope in my hand and a cow by the tail.

  I'm up in the mornin' afore daylight
  And afore I sleep the moon shines bright.

  Old Ben Bolt was a blamed good boss,
  But he'd go to see the girls on a sore-backed hoss.

  Old Ben Bolt was a fine old man
  And you'd know there was whiskey wherever he'd land.

  My hoss throwed me off at the creek called Mud,
  My hoss throwed me off round the 2-U herd.

  Last time I saw him he was going cross the level
  A-kicking up his heels and a-runnin' like the devil.

  It's cloudy in the west, a-lookin' like rain,
  An' my damned old slicker's in the wagon again.

  Crippled my hoss, I don't know how,
  Ropin' at the horns of a 2-U cow.

  We hit Caldwell and we hit her on the fly,
  We bedded down the cattle on the hill close by.

  No chaps, no slicker, and it's pourin' down rain,
  An' I swear, by God, I'll never night-herd again.

  Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle,
  I hung and rattled with them long-horn cattle.

  Last night I was on guard and the leader broke the ranks,
  I hit my horse down the shoulders and I spurred him in the flanks.

  The wind commenced to blow, and the rain began to fall.
  Hit looked, by grab, like we was goin' to lose 'em all.

  I jumped in the saddle and grabbed holt the horn,
  Best blamed cow-puncher ever was born.

  I popped my foot in the stirrup and gave a little yell,
  The tail cattle broke and the leaders went to hell.

  I don't give a damn if they never do stop;
  I'll ride as long as an eight-day clock.

  Foot in the stirrup and hand on the horn,
  Best damned cowboy ever was born.

  I herded and I hollered and I done very well
  Till the boss said, 'Boys, just let 'em go to hell.'

  Stray in the herd and the boss said kill it,
  So I shot him in the rump with the handle of the skillet.

  We rounded 'em up and put 'em on the cars,
  And that was the last of the old Two Bars.

  Oh, it's bacon and beans most every day,--
  I'd as soon be a-eatin' prairie hay.

  I'm on my best horse and I'm goin' at a run,
  I'm the quickest shootin' cowboy that ever pulled a gun.

  I went to the wagon to get my roll,
  To come back to Texas, dad-burn my soul.

  I went to the boss to draw my roll,
  He had it figgered out I was nine dollars in the hole.

  I'll sell my outfit just as soon as I can,
  I won't punch cattle for no damned man.

  Goin' back to town to draw my money,
  Goin' back home to see my honey.

  With my knees in the saddle and my seat in the sky,
  I'll quit punchin' cows in the sweet by and by.

    Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya, youpy ya,
    Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya."

As the last words of the chorus died away both men started at the sound
of the girl's voice.

"Whenever you can spare the time you will find your supper ready," she
announced, coldly, and without waiting for a reply, turned toward the
camp.  Endicott looked at Tex, and Tex looked at Endicott.

"Seems like you done raised hell again, Win.  Standin' around listenin'
to ribald songs, like you done, ain't helped our case none.  Well, we
better go eat it before she throws it away.  Come on, Bat, you're
included in the general gloom.  Your face looks like a last year's
circus bill, Win, with them patches of paper hangin' to it.  Maybe
that's what riled her.  If I thought it was I'd yank 'em off an' let
them cuts bleed no matter how bad they stung, just to show her my
heart's in the right place.  But that might not suit, neither, so there
you are."

Alice sat well back from the fire as the three men poured their coffee
and helped themselves to the food.

"Ain't you goin' to join us in this here repast?" asked Tex, with a
smile.

"I have eaten, thank you."

"You're welcome--like eight dollars change for a five-spot."

In vain Endicott signalled the cowboy to keep silent.  "Shove over,
Win, you're proddin' me in the ribs with your elbow!  Ain't Choteau
County big enough to eat in without crowdin'?  'Tain't as big as Tom
Green County, at that, no more'n Montana is as big as Texas--nor as
good, either; not but what the rest of the United States has got
somethin' to be said in its favour, though.  But comparisons are
ordorous, as the Dutchman said about the cheese.  Come on, Win, me an'
you'll just wash up these dishes so Bat can pack 'em while we saddle
up."

A half-hour later, just as the moon topped the crest of a high ridge,
the four mounted and made their way down into the valley.

"We got to go kind of easy for a few miles 'cause I shouldn't wonder if
old man Johnson had got a gang out interrin' defunck bovines.  I'll
just scout out ahead an' see if I can locate their camp so we can slip
past without incurrin' notoriety."

"I should think," said Alice, with more than a trace of acid in her
tone, "that you had done quite enough scouting for one day."

"In which case," smiled the unabashed Texan, "I'll delegate the duty to
my trustworthy retainer an' side-kicker, the ubiquitous an' iniquitous
Baterino St. Cecelia Julius Caesar Napoleon Lajune.  Here, Bat, fork
over that pack-horse an' take a siyou out ahead, keepin' a lookout for
posses, post holes, and grave-diggers.  It's up to you to see that we
pass down this vale of tears, unsight an' unsung, as the poet says, or
off comes your hind legs.  Amen."

The half-breed grinned his understanding and handed over the lead-rope
with a bit of homely advice.  "You no lak' you git find, dat better you
don' talk mooch.  You ain' got to sing no mor', neider, or ba Goss!
A'm tak' you down an' stick you mout' full of rags, lak' I done down to
Chinook dat tam'.  Dat _hooch_ she mak' noise 'nough for wan night,
_sabe_?"

"That's right, Bat.  Tombstones and oysters is plumb raucous
institutions to what I'll be from now on."  He turned to the others
with the utmost gravity.  "You folks will pardon any seemin' reticence
on my part, I hope.  But there's times when Bat takes holt an' runs the
outfit--an' this is one of 'em."


CHAPTER XIV

ON ANTELOPE BUTTE

After the departure of Bat it was a very silent little cavalcade that
made its way down the valley.  Tex, with the lead-horse in tow, rode
ahead, his attention fixed on the trail, and the others followed,
single file.

Alice's eyes strayed from the backs of her two companions to the
mountains that rolled upward from the little valley, their massive
peaks and buttresses converted by the wizardry of moonlight into a
fairyland of wondrous grandeur.  The cool night air was fragrant with
the breath of growing things, and the feel of her horse beneath her
caused the red blood to surge through her veins.

"Oh, it's grand!" she whispered, "the mountains, and the moonlight, and
the spring.  I love it all--and yet--"  She frowned at the jarring note
that crept in, to mar the fulness of her joy.  "It's the most wonderful
adventure I ever had--and romantic.  And it's _real_, and I ought to be
enjoying it more than I ever enjoyed anything in all my life.  But, I'm
not, and it's all because--I don't see why he had to go and drink!"
The soft sound of the horses' feet in the mud changed to a series of
sharp clicks as their iron shoes encountered the bare rocks of the
floor of the canyon whose precipitous rock walls towered far above,
shutting off the flood of moonlight and plunging the trail into
darkness.  The figures of the two men were hardly discernible, and the
girl started nervously as her horse splashed into the water of the
creek that foamed noisily over the canyon floor.  She shivered slightly
in the wind that sucked chill through the winding passage, although
back there in the moonlight the night had been still.  Gradually the
canyon widened.  Its walls grew lower and slanted from the
perpendicular.  Moonlight illumined the wider bends and flashed in
silver scintillations from the broken waters of the creek.  The click
of the horses' feet again gave place to the softer trampling of mud,
and the valley once more spread before them, broader now, and flanked
by an endless succession of foothills.

Bat appeared mysteriously from nowhere, and after a whispered colloquy
with Tex, led off toward the west, leaving the valley behind and
winding into the maze of foothills.  A few miles farther on they came
again into the valley and Alice saw that the creek had dwindled into a
succession of shallow pools between which flowed a tiny trickle of the
water.  On and on they rode, following the shallow valley.  Lush grass
overran the pools and clogged the feeble trickle of the creek.  Farther
on, even the green patches disappeared and white alkali soil showed
between the gnarled sage bushes.  Gradually the aspect of the country
changed.  High, grass-covered foothills gave place to sharp pinnacles
of black lava rock, the sides of the valley once more drew together,
low, and broken into ugly cutbanks of dirty grey.  Sagebrush and
prickly pears furnished the only vegetation, and the rough, broken
surface of the country took on a starved, gaunt appearance.

Alice knew instinctively that they were at the gateway of the bad
lands, and the forbidding aspect that greeted her on every side as her
eyes swept the restricted horizon caused a feeling of depression.  Even
the name "bad lands" seemed to hold a foreboding of evil.  She had not
noticed this when the Texan had spoken it.  If she had thought of it at
all, it was impersonally--an undesirable strip of country, as one
mentions the Sahara Desert.  But, now, when she herself was entering
it--was seeing with her own eyes the grey mud walls, the bare black
rocks, and the stunted sage and cactus--the name held much of sinister
portent.

From a nearby hillock came a thin weird scream--long-drawn and broken
into a series of horrible cackles.  Instantly, as though it were the
signal that loosed the discordant chorus of hell, the sound was caught
up, intensified and prolonged until the demonical screams seemed to
belch from every hill and from the depths of the coulees between.

Unconsciously, the girl spurred her horse which leaped past Endicott
and Bat and drew up beside the Texan, who was riding alone in the
forefront.

The man glanced into the white frightened face: "Coyotes," he said,
gravely.  "They won't bother any one."

The girl shuddered.  "There must be a million of them.  What makes them
howl that way?"

"Most any other way would be better, wouldn't it.  But I reckon that's
the way they've learnt to, so they just keep on that way."

Alice glanced at him sharply, but in the moonlight his clean-cut
profile gave no hint of levity.

"You are making fun of me!"

He turned his head and regarded her thoughtfully.  "No.  I wouldn't do
that, really.  I was thinkin' of somethin' else."

"You are a very disconcerting young man.  You are unspeakably rude, and
I ought to be furiously angry."

The Texan appeared to consider.  "No.  You oughtn't to do that because
when something important comes up you ain't got anything back, an'
folks won't regard you serious.  But you wouldn't have been even peeved
if you knew what I was thinkin' about."

"What was it?"  The instant the question left her lips the girl wished
she could have recalled it.

There was a long pause and Alice began to hope that the man had not
heard her question.  Then he turned a very grave face toward her and
his eyes met hers squarely.   "I was thinkin' that maybe, sometime,
you'd get to care enough about me to marry me.  Sounds kind of abrupt
an' off-hand, don't it?  But it ain't.  I've been thinkin' about it a
lot.  You're the first woman I've seen since--well, since way back
yonder, that I'd ever marry.  The only one that stacks up to the kind
of people mine are, an' that I was back there.  Of course, there'd be a
lot of readjustin' but that would work out--it always does when the
right kind of folks takes holt to put anything through.  I've got some
recreations an' pastimes that ain't condoned by the pious.  I gamble,
an' swear, an' smoke, an' lie, an' drink.  But I gamble square, swear
decent an' hearty, lie for fun, but never in earnest, an' drink to a
reasonable degree of hilarity.  My word is good with every man, woman,
an' child in the cow country.  I never yet went back on a friend, nor
let up on an enemy.  I never took underhand advantage of man or woman,
an' I know the cow business.  For the rest of it, I'll go to the old
man an' offer to take the Eagle Creek ranch off his hands an' turn
nester.  It's a good ranch, an' one that rightly handled would make a
man rich--provided he was a married man an' had somethin' to get rich
for.  I don't want you to tell me now, you won't, or you will.  We've
got a week or so yet to get acquainted in.  An', here's another thing.
I know, an' you know, down deep in your heart, that you're goin' to
marry either Win, or me.  Maybe you know which.  I don't.  But if it is
him, you'll get a damned good man.  He's square an' clean.  He's got
nerve--an' there ain't no bluff about it, neither.  Wise men don't fool
with a man with an eye like his.  An' he wants you as bad as I do.  As
I said, we've got a week or more to get acquainted.  It will be a week
that may take us through some mighty tough sleddin', but that ain't
goin' to help you none in choosin', because neither one of us will
break--an' you can bet your last stack of blue ones on that."

The girl's lips were pressed very tight, and for some moments she rode
in silence.

"Do you suppose I would ever marry a man who deliberately gets so drunk
he sings and talks incessantly----"

"You'd be safer marryin' one that got drunk deliberately, than one who
done it inadvertent when he aimed to stay sober.  Besides, there's
various degrees of drunkenness, the term bein' relative.  But for the
sake of argument admittin' I was drunk, if you object to the singin'
and talkin', what do you recommend a man to do when he's drunk?"

"I utterly despise a man that gets drunk!"  The words came with an
angry vehemence, and for many minutes the Texan rode in silence while
the bit chains clinked and the horses' hoofs thudded the ground dully.
And where was the soft green carpet of moss and tender grass that was
spread out so beautifully at the bottom of the hollow? It was all
changed, as if the breath of an evil spirit had blown upon it. 'Isn't
it too bad!' we all exclaimed; and after we had given expression to
our feelings by these few words, we proceeded to a closer examination.
All the trees along the hill-side had been cut down, and little piles
of wood were put up, to carry away. The May flowers were all dried
up in the sun, and the ground pine and bear's grass were as sere
and yellow as the autumn leaves.

Down in the bottom of the hollow, the turf had been cut up and carried
off, and there lay the bones of an old horse bleaching in the
sun. There was only a little stump left of the acorn tree, with a few
withered branches. 'Isn't it a sin, and a shame!' said Alfred,
indignantly. 'I never want to come here again,' murmured Charlie;
and I sat down on the stump and cried.

If all the world had been looking at me I couldn't have helped it.

"Then I thought how strangely everything was changing around me.

Nothing appeared the same to me, save the sun and stars and the broad
blue sea.

Father and mother, brothers and sisters, and the great world itself,
were all changing.

I too was changed. Time and study, with daily trial, were making me an
altogether different being from what I had been, and I knew that the
finger of the Almighty was writing lessons upon my heart, which I
could never forget; no, not through all eternity.

That's why we're goin' to camp on
Antelope Butte--right up on top of it."

"But, how will we get water?"

"It's there."

"Have you been up there?"  The girl glanced upward.  They were already
ascending the first slope, and the huge mass of the detached mountain
towered above them in a series of unscaleable precipices.

"No.  But the water's there.  The top of the Butte hollows out like a
saucer, an' in the bowl there's a little sunk spring.  No one much ever
goes up there.  There's a little scragglin' timber, an' the trail--it's
an old game trail--is hard to find if you don't know where to look for
it.  A horse-thief told me about it."

"A horse-thief!  Surely, you are not risking all our lives on the word
of a horse-thief!"

"Yes.  He was a pretty good fellow.  They killed him, afterwards, over
near the Mission.  He was runnin' off a bunch of Flourey horses."

"But a man who would steal would lie!"

"He didn't lie to me.  He judged I done him a good turn once.  Over on
the Marias, it was--an' he said: 'If you're ever on the run, hit for
Antelope Butte.'  Then he told me about the trail, an' the spring that
you've got to dig for among the rocks.  He's got a grub _cache_ there,
too.  He won't be needin' it, now."  The cowboy glanced toward the
west.  "The moon ought to just about hold 'til we get to the top.  He
said you could ride all the way up."  Without an instant's hesitation
he headed his horse for a huge mass of rock fragments that lay at the
base of an almost perpendicular wall.  The others followed in single
file.  Bat bringing up the rear driving the pack-horse before him.
Alice kept her horse close behind the Texan's which wormed and twisted
in and out among the rock fragments that skirted the wall.  For a
quarter of a mile they proceeded with scarcely a perceptible rise and
then the cowboy turned his horse into a deep fissure that slanted
upward at a most precarious angle seemingly straight into the heart of
the mountain.  Just when it seemed that the trail must end in a blind
pocket, the Texan swung into a cross fissure so narrow that the
stirrups brushed either side.  So dark was it between the towering rock
walls that Alice could scarcely make out the cowboy's horse, although
at no time was he more than ten or fifteen feet in advance.  After
innumerable windings the fissure led once more to the face of the
mountain and Tex headed his horse out upon a ledge that had not been
discernible from below.  Alice gasped, and for a moment it seemed as
though she could not go on.  Spread out before her like a huge relief
map were the ridges and black coulees of the bad lands, and directly
below--hundreds of feet below--the gigantic rock fragments lay strewn
along the base of the cliff like the abandoned blocks of a child.  She
closed her eyes and shuddered.  A loose piece of rock on the narrow
trail, a stumble, and--she could feel herself whirling down, down,
down.  It was the voice of the Texan--confident, firm, reassuring--that
brought her once more to her senses.

"It's all right.  Just follow right along.  Shut your eyes, or keep 'em
to the wall.  We're half-way up.  It ain't so steep from here on, an'
she widens toward the top.  I'm dizzy-headed, too, in high places an' I
shut mine.  Just give the horse a loose rein an' he'll keep the trail.
There ain't nowhere else for him to go."

With a deadly fear in her heart, the girl fastened her eyes upon the
cowboy's back and gave her horse his head.  And as she rode she
wondered at this man who unhesitatingly risked his life upon the word
of a horse-thief.

Almost before she realized it the ordeal was over and her horse was
following its leader through a sparse grove of bull pine.  The ascent
was still rather sharp, and the way strewn with boulders, and fallen
trees, but the awful precipice, with its sheer drop of many hundreds of
feet to the black rocks below, no longer yawned at her stirrup's edge,
and it was with a deep-drawn breath of relief that she allowed her eyes
once again to travel out over the vast sweep of waste toward the west
where the moon hung low and red above the distant rim of the bad lands.

The summit of Antelope Butte was, as the horse-thief had said, an ideal
camping place for any one who was "on the run."  The edges of the
little plateau, which was roughly circular in form, rose on every side
to a height of thirty or forty feet, at some points in an easy slope,
and at others in a sheer rise of rock wall.  The surface of the little
plane showed no trace of the black of the lava rock of the lower levels
but was of the character of the open bench and covered with buffalo
grass and bunch grass with here and there a sprinkling of prickly
pears.  The four dismounted and, in the last light of the moon,
surveyed their surroundings.

"You make camp, Bat," ordered the Texan, "while me an' Win hunt up the
spring.  He said it was on the east side where there was a lot of loose
rock along the edge of the bull pine.  We'll make the camp there, too,
where the wood an' water will be handy."

Skirting the plateau, Tex led the way toward a point where a few
straggling pines showed gaunt and lean in the rapidly waning moonlight.

"It ought to be somewheres around here," he said, as he stopped to
examine the ground more closely.  "He said you had to pile off the
rocks 'til you come to the water an' then mud up a catch-basin."  As he
talked, the cowboy groped among the loose rocks on his hands and knees,
pausing frequently to lay his ear to the ground.  "Here she is!" he
exclaimed at length.  "I can hear her drip!  Come on, Win, we'll build
our well."

Alice stood close beside her horse watching every move with intense
interest.

"Who would have thought to look for water there?" she exclaimed.

"I knew we'd find it just as he said," answered the Texan gravely.  "He
was a good man, in his way--never run off no horses except from outfits
that could afford to lose 'em.  Why, they say, he could have got plumb
away if he'd shot the posse man that run onto him over by the Mission.
But he knew the man was a nester with a wife an' two kids, so he took a
chance--an' the nester got him."

"How could he?" cried the girl, "after----"

The Texan regarded her gravely.  "It was tough.  An' he probably hated
to do it.  But he was a sworn-in posse man, an' the other was a
horse-thief.  It was just one of those things a man's got to do.  Like
Jim Larkin, when he was sheriff, havin' to shoot his own brother, an'
him hardly more'n a kid that Jim had raised.  But he'd gone plumb bad
an' swore never to be taken alive, so Jim killed him--an' then he
resigned.  There ain't a man that knows Jim, that don't know he'd
rather a thousan' times over had the killin' happen the other way
'round.  But he was a man.  He had it to do--an' he done it."

Alice shuddered: "And then--what became of him, then?"

"Why, then, he went back to ranchin'.  He owns the Bar X horse outfit
over on the White Mud.  This here, Owen--that was his brother's
name--was just like a son to him.  Jim tried to steer him straight, but
the kid was just naturally a bad egg.  Feelin' it the way he does, a
lesser man might of squinted down the muzzle of his own gun, or gone
the whiskey route.  But not him.  To all appearances he's the same as
he always was.  But some of us that know him best--we can see that he
ain't _quite_ the same as before--an' he never will be."

There were tears in the girl's eyes as the man finished.

"Oh, it's all wrong!  It's cruel, and hard, and brutal, and wrong!"

"No.  It ain't wrong.  It's hard, an' it's cruel, maybe, an' brutal.
But it's right.  It ain't a country for weaklings--the cow country
ain't.  It's a country where, every now an' then, a man comes square up
against something that he's got to do.  An' that something is apt as
not to be just what he don't want to do.  If he does it, he's a man,
an' the cow country needs him.  If he don't do it, he passes on to
where there's room for his kind--an' the cow country don't miss him.  A
man earns his place here, it ain't made for him--often he earns the
name by which he's called.  I reckon it's the same all over--only this
is rawer."

"Here's the water!  And it is cold and sweet," called Endicott who had
been busily removing the loose rock fragments beneath which the spring
lay concealed.

The Texan's interest centred on matters at hand: "You Bat, you make a
fire when you've finished with the horses."  He turned again to the
girl: "If you'll be the cook, Win an' I'll mud up a catch-basin an'
rustle some firewood while Bat makes camp.  We got to do all our
cookin' at night up here.  A fire won't show above the rim yonder, but
in the daytime someone might see the smoke from ten mile off."

"Of course, I'll do the cooking!" assented the girl, and began to carry
the camp utensils from the pack that the half-breed had thrown upon the
ground.  "The dough-gods are all gone!" she exclaimed in dismay,
peering into a canvas bag.

"Mix up some bakin'-powder ones.  There's flour an' stuff in that brown
sack."

"But--I don't know how!"

"All right.  Wait 'til I get Win strung out on this job, an' I'll make
up a batch."

He watched Endicott arrange some stones: "Hey, you got to fit those
rocks in better'n that.  Mud ain't goin' to hold without a good
backin'."

The cowboy washed his hands in the overflow trickle and wiped them upon
his handkerchief.  "I don't know what folks does all their lives back
East," he grinned; "Win, there, ain't barbered none to speak of, an'
the Lord knows he ain't no stone-mason."

Alice did not return the smile, and the Texan noticed that her face was
grave in the pale starlight.  For the first time in her life the girl
felt ashamed of her own incompetence.

"And I can't cook, and----"

"Well, that's so," drawled Tex, "but it won't be so tomorrow.  No one
but a fool would blame any one for not doin' a thing they've never
learnt to do.  They might wonder a little how-come they never learnt,
but they wouldn't hold it against 'em--not 'til they've had the
chance."  Bat was still busy with the horses and the cowboy collected
sticks and lighted a small fire, talking, as he worked with swift
movements that accomplished much without the least show of haste.  "It
generally don't take long in the cow country for folks to get their
chance.  Take Win, there.  Day before yesterday he was about the
greenest pilgrim that ever straddled a horse.  Not only he didn't know
anything worth while knowin', but he was prejudiced.  The first time I
looked at him I sized him up--almost.  'There's a specimen,' I says to
myself--while you an' Purdy was gossipin' about the handkerchief, an'
the dance, an' what a beautiful rider he was--'that's gone on gatherin'
refinement 'til it's crusted onto him so thick it's probably struck
through.'  But just as I was losin' interest in him, he slanted a
glance at Purdy that made me look him over again.  There he stood, just
the same as before--only different."  The Texan poured some flour into
a pan and threw in a couple of liberal pinches of baking-powder.

Alice's eyes followed his every movement, and she glanced toward the
spring that Endicott had churned into a mud hole.  The cowboy noted her
glance.  "It would be riled too much even if we strained it," he
smiled, "so we'll just use what's left in that flask.  It don't take
much water an' the spring will clear in time for the coffee."

"And some people never do learn?" Alice wanted to hear more from this
man's lips concerning the pilgrim.  But the Texan mustn't know that she
wanted to hear.

"Yes, some don't learn, some only half learn, an' some learn in a way
that carries 'em along 'til it comes to a pinch--they're the worst.
But, speakin' of Win, after I caught that look, the only surprise I got
when I heard he'd killed Purdy was that he _could_ do it--not that he
_would_.  Then later, under certain circumstances that come to pass in
a coulee where there was cottonwoods, him an' I got better acquainted
yet.  An' then in the matter of the reservoir--but you know more about
that than I do.  You see what I'm gettin' at is this: Win can saddle
his own horse, now, an' he climbs onto him from the left side.  The
next time he tackles it he'll shave, an' the next time he muds up a
catch-basin he'll mud it right.  Day before yesterday he was about as
useless a lookin' piece of bric-a-brac as ever draw'd breath--an' look
at him now!  There ain't been any real change.  The man was there all
the time, only he was so well disguised that no one ever know'd
it--himself least of all.  Yesterday I saw him take a chew off Bat's
plug--an' Bat don't offer his plug promiscuous.  He'll go back East,
an' the refinement will cover him up again--an' that's a damned shame.
But he won't be just the same.  It won't crust over no more, because
the prejudice is gone.  He's chewed the meat of the cow country--an'
he's found it good."

Later, long after the others had gone to sleep, Alice lay between her
blankets in the little shelter tent, thinking.


CHAPTER XV

THE TEXAN HEARS SOME NEWS

Bat had pitched the tent upon a little knoll, screened by a jutting
shoulder of rock from the sleeping place of the others.  When Alice
awoke it was broad daylight.  She lay for a few moments enjoying the
delicious luxury of her blankets which the half-breed had spread upon a
foot-thick layer of boughs.  The sun beat down upon the white canvas
and she realized that it was hot in the tent.  The others must have
been up for hours and she resented their not having awakened her.  She
listened for sounds, but outside all was silence and she dressed
hurriedly.  Stepping from the tent, she saw the dead ashes of the
little fire and the contents of the packs apparently undisturbed,
covered with the tarp.  She glanced at her watch.  It was half past
nine.  Suddenly she remembered that dawn had already began to grey the
east when they retired.  She was the first one up!  She would let the
others sleep.  They needed it.  She remembered the Texan had not slept
the day before, but had ridden away to return later with the clothing
for Endicott--and the whiskey.

"I don't see why he has to drink!" she muttered, and making her way to
the spring, dipped some water from the catch-basin and splashed it over
her face and arms.  The cold water dispelled the last vestige of
sleepiness and she stood erect and breathed deeply of the crystal air.
At the farther side of the bowl-like plateau the horses grazed
contentedly, and a tiny black and white woodpecker flew from tree to
tree pecking busily at the bark.  Above the edge of the rim-rocks the
high-flung peaks of the Bear Paws belied the half-night's ride that
separated them from the isolated Antelope Butte.

"What a view one should get from the edge!" she exclaimed, and turning
from the spring, made her way through the scraggly timber to the rock
wall beyond.  It was not a long climb and five minutes later she stood
panting with exertion and leaned against an upstanding pinnacle of
jagged rock.  For a long time she stood wonder-bound by the mighty
grandeur of the panorama that swept before her to lose itself somewhere
upon the dim horizon.  Her brain grasped for details.  It was all too
big--too unreal--too unlike the world she had known.  In sheer
desperation, for sight of some familiar thing, her eyes turned toward
the camp.  There was the little white tent, and the horses grazing
beyond.  Her elevation carried her range of vision over the jutting
shoulder of rock, and she saw the Texan sitting beside his blankets
drawing on his boots.  The blankets were mounded over the forms of the
others, and without disturbing them, the cowboy put on his hat and
started toward the spring.  At the sight of the little tent he paused
and Alice saw him stand staring at the little patch of white canvas.
For a long time he stood unmoving, and then, impulsively, his two arms
stretched toward it.  The arms were as quickly withdrawn.  The Stetson
was lifted from his head and once more it seemed a long time that he
stood looking at the little tent with the soft brim of his Stetson
crushed tightly in his hand.

Evidently, for fear of waking her, the man did not go to the spring,
but retraced his steps and Alice saw him stoop and withdraw something
from his war-bag.  Thrusting the object beneath his shirt, he rose
slowly and made his way toward the rim-rock, choosing for his ascent a
steep incline which, with the aid of some rock ledges, would bring him
to the top at a point not ten yards from where she stood.

It was with a sense of guilt that she realized she had spied upon this
man, and her cheeks flushed as she cast about desperately for a means
to escape unseen.  But no such avenue presented itself, and she drew
back into a deep crevice of her rock pinnacle lest he see her.

A grubby, stunted pine somehow managed to gain sustenance from the
stray earth among the rock cracks and screened her hiding-place.  The
man was very close, now.  She could hear his heavy breathing and the
click of his boot heels upon the bare rocks.  Then he crossed to the
very verge of the precipice and seated himself with his feet hanging
over the edge.  For some moments he sat gazing out over the bad lands,
and then his hand slipped into the front of his shirt and withdrew a
bottle of whiskey.

The girl's lips tightened as she watched him from behind her screen of
naked roots and branches.  He looked a long time at the bottle, shook
it, and held it to the sun as he contemplated the little beads that
sparkled at the edge of the liquor line.  He read its label, and seemed
deeply interested in the lines of fine print contained upon an oval
sticker that adorned its back.  Still holding the bottle, he once more
stared out over the bad lands.  Then he drew the cork and smelled of
the liquor, breathing deeply of its fragrance, and turning, gazed
intently toward the little white tent beside the stunted pines.

Alice saw that his eyes were serious as he set the bottle upon the rock
beside him.  And then, hardly discernible at first, but gradually
assuming distinct form, a whimsical smile curved his lips as he looked
at the bottle.

"Gosh!" he breathed, softly, "ain't you an' I had some nonsensical
times?  I ain't a damned bit sorry, neither.  But our trails fork here.
Maybe for a while--maybe for ever.  But if it is for ever, my average
will be right honourable if I live to be a hundred."  Alice noticed how
boyish the clean-cut features looked when he smiled that way.  The
other smile--the masking, cynical smile--made him ten years older.  The
face was once more grave, and he raised the bottle from the rock.  "So
long," he said, and there was just that touch of honest regret in his
voice with which he would have parted from a friend.  "So long.  I've
got a choice to make--an' I don't choose you."

The hand that held the bottle was empty.  There was a moment of silence
and then from far below came the tinkle of smashing glass.  The Texan
got up, adjusted the silk scarf at his neck, rolled a cigarette, and
clambering down the sharp descent, made his way toward the grazing
horses.  Alice watched for a moment as he walked up to his own horse,
stroked his neck, and lightly cuffed at the ears which the horse laid
back as he playfully snapped at his master's hand.  Then she scrambled
from her hiding-place and hurried unobserved to her tent, where she
threw herself upon the blankets with a sound that was somehow very like
a sob.

When the breakfast of cold coffee and biscuits was finished the Texan
watched Endicott's clumsy efforts to roll a cigarette.

"Better get you a piece of twine to do it with, Win," he grinned; "you
sure are a long ways from home when it comes to braidin' a smoke.  Saw
a cow-hand do it once with one hand.  In a show, it was in Cheyenne,
an' he sure was some cowboy--in the show.  Come out onto the flats one
day where the boys was breakin' a bunch of Big O Little O
horses--'after local colour,' he said."  The Texan paused and grinned
broadly.  "Got it too.  He clum up into the middle of a wall-eyed
buckskin an' the doc picked local colour out of his face for two hours
where he'd slid along on it--but he could roll a cigarette with one
hand.  There, you got one at last, didn't you?  Kind of humped up in
the middle like a snake that's swallowed a frog, but she draws all
right, an' maybe it'll last longer than a regular one."  He turned to
Alice who had watched the operation with interest.

"If you-all don't mind a little rough climbin', I reckon, you'd count
the view from the rim-rocks yonder worth seein'."

"Oh, I'd love it!" cried the girl, as she scrambled to her feet.

"Come on, Win," called the Texan, "I'll show you where God dumped the
tailin's when He finished buildin' the world."

Together the three scaled the steep rock-wall.  Alice, scorning
assistance, was the first to reach the top, and once more the splendour
of the magnificent waste held her speechless.

For some moments they gazed in silence.  Before them, bathed in a pale
amethyst haze that thickened to purple at the far-off edge of the
world, lay the bad lands resplendent under the hot glare of the sun in
vivid red and black and pink colouring of the lava rock.  Everywhere
the eye met the flash and shimmer of mica fragments that sparkled like
the facets of a million diamonds, while to the northward the Bear Paws
reared cool and green, with the grass of the higher levels reaching
almost to the timber line.

"Isn't it wonderful?" breathed the girl.  "Why do people stay cooped up
in the cities, when out here there is--this?"  Endicott's eyes met
hers, and in their depths she perceived a newly awakened fire.  She was
conscious of a strange glow at her heart--a mighty gladness welled up
within her, permeating her whole being.  "He has awakened," her brain
repeated over and over again, "he has----"

The voice of the Texan fell upon her ears softly as from a distance,
and she turned her eyes to the boyish faced cow-puncher who viewed life
lightly and who, she had learned, was the thorough master of his
wilderness, and very much a man.

"I love it too," he was saying.  "This bad land best of all.  What with
the sheep, an' the nesters, the range country must go.  But barbed-wire
can never change this," his arm swept the vast plain before him.  "I
suppose God foreseen what the country was comin' to," he speculated,
"an' just naturally stuck up His 'keep off' sign on places here an'
there--the Sahara Desert, an' Death Valley, an' the bad lands.  He
wanted somethin' left like He made it.  Yonder's the Little Rockies,
an' them big black buttes to the south are the Judith, an' you can
see--way beyond the Judith--if you look close--the Big Snowy Mountains.
They're more than a hundred miles away."

The cowboy ceased speaking suddenly.  And Alice, following his gaze,
made out far to the north-eastward a moving speck.  The Texan crouched
and motioned the others into the shelter of a rock.  "Wish I had a pair
of glasses," he muttered, with his eyes on the moving dot.

"What is it?" asked the girl.

"Rider of some kind.  Maybe the I X round-up is workin' the south
slope.  An' maybe it's just a horse-thief.  But it mightn't be either.
Guess I'll just throw the hull on that cayuse of mine an' siyou down
and see.  He's five or six miles off yet, an' I've got plenty of time
to slip down there.  Glad the trail's on the west side.  You two stay
up here, but you got to be awful careful not to show yourselves.  Folks
down below look awful little from here, but if they've got glasses
you'd loom up plenty big, an' posse men's apt to pack glasses."  The
two followed him to camp and a few moments later watched him ride off
at a gallop and disappear in the scrub that concealed the mouth of the
precipitous trail.

Hardly had he passed from sight than Bat rose and, walking to his
saddle, uncoiled his rope.

"Where are you going?" asked Endicott as the half-breed started toward
the horses.

"Me, oh, A'm trail long behine.  Mebbe-so two kin see better'n wan."

A few minutes later he too was swallowed up in the timber at the head
of the trail, and Alice and Endicott returned to the rim-rocks and from
a place of concealment watched with breathless interest the course of
the lone horseman.

After satisfying himself he was unobserved, the Texan pushed from the
shelter of the rocks at the foot of the trail and, circling the butte,
struck into a coulee that led south-eastward into the bad lands.  A
mile away he crossed a ridge and gained another coulee which he
followed northward.

"If he's headin' into the bad lands I'll meet up with him, an' if he's
just skirtin' 'em, our trails'll cross up here a piece," he reasoned as
his horse carried him up the dry ravine at a steady walk.  Presently he
slanted into a steep side coulee that led upward to the crest of a long
flat ridge.  For a moment he paused as his eyes swept the landscape and
then suddenly a quarter of a mile away a horseman appeared out of
another coulee.  He, too, paused and, catching sight of the Texan, dug
in his spurs and came toward him at a run.

The cowboy's brows drew into a puzzled frown as he studied the rapidly
approaching horseman.  "Well, I'll be damned!" he grinned, "ain't he
the friendly young spirit!  His ma had ought to look after him better'n
that an' teach him some manners.  The idea of any one chargin' up to a
stranger that way in the bad lands!  One of these days he's a-goin' to
run up again' an abrupt foreshortin' of his reckless young career."
The rider was close now and the Texan recognized a self-important young
jackass who had found work with one of the smaller outfits.

"It's that mouthy young short-horn from the K 2," he muttered,
disgustedly.  "Well, he'll sure cut loose an' earful of small talk.  He
hates himself, like a peacock."  The cowboy pulled up his horse with a
vicious jerk that pinked the foam at the animal's mouth and caused a
little cloud of dust to rise into the air.  Then, for a moment, he sat
and stared.

"If you was in such a hell of a hurry," drawled the Texan, "you could
of rode around me.  There's room on either side."

The cowboy found his voice.  "Well, by gosh, if it ain't Tex!  How they
stackin', old hand?"

"Howdy," replied the Texan, dryly.

"You take my advice an' lay low here in the bad lands an' they won't
ketch you.  I said it right in the Long Horn yeste'day mornin'--they
was a bunch of us lappin' 'em up.  Old Pete was there--an' I says to
Pete, I says, 'Take it from me they might ketch all the rest of 'em but
they won't never ketch Tex!'  An' Pete, he says, 'You're just right
there, Joe,' an' then he takes me off to one side, old Pete does, an'
he says, 'Joe,' he says, 'I've got a ticklish job to be done, an' I
ain't got another man I kin bank on puttin' it through.'"

The Texan happened to know that Mr. Peter G. Kester, owner of the K 2,
was a very dignified old gentleman who left the details of his ranch
entirely in the hands of his foreman, and the idea of his drinking in
the Long Horn with his cowboys was as unique as was hearing him
referred to as "Old Pete."

"What's ailin' him?" asked the Texan.  "Did he lose a hen, or is he
fixin' to steal someone's mewl?"

"It's them Bar A saddle horses," continued the cowboy, without noticing
the interruption.  "He buys a string of twenty three-year-olds offen
the Bar A an' they broke out of the pasture.  They range over here on
the south slope, an' if them horse-thieves down in the bad lands has
got 'em they're a-goin' to think twict before they run off any more K 2
horses, as long as I'm workin' fer the outfit."

"Are you aimin' to drive twenty head of horses off their own range
single handed?"

"Sure.  You can do it easy if you savvy horses."

The Texan refrained from comment.  He wanted to know who was supposed
to be interested in catching him, and why.  Had someone told the truth
about the lynching, and was he really wanted for aiding and abetting
the pilgrim's escape?

"I reckon that's true," he opined.  "They can't get me here in the bad
lands."

The other laughed: "You bet they can't!  Say, that was some ride you
put up down to Wolf River.  None of us could have done better."

"Did you say they was headin' this way?"

"Who?"

"Who would I be thinkin' about now, I wonder?"

"Oh!  Naw!  They ain't ready to make any arrests yet.  The grand jury
set special an' returned a lot of indictments an' you're one of 'em,
but the districk attorney, he claims he can't go ahead until he digs up
the cripus delinkty----"

"The what?"

"Oh, that's a nickname the lawyers has got fer a pilgrim."

"Wasn't one stranglin' enough for spreadin' out Purdy?  What do they
want of the pilgrim?"

"Spreadin' out Purdy!" exclaimed the other, "don't you know that Purdy
didn't stay spread?  Wasn't hardly hurt even.  The pilgrim's bullet
just barely creased him, an' when Sam Moore went back with a spring
wagon to fetch his remains, Purdy riz up an' started cussin' him out
an' scairt Sam so his team run away an' he lost his voice an' ain't
spoke out loud since--an' them's only one of the things he done.  So,
you see, you done your lynching too previous, an' folks is all stirred
up about it, holdin' that lawless acts has got to be put a stop to in
Choteau County, an' a pilgrim has got as good a right to live as the
next one.  They're holdin' that even if he had got Purdy it would of
be'n a damn good thing, an' they wasn't no call to stretch a man for
that.  So the grand jury set, an' the districk attorney has got a gang
of men diggin' up all the coulees for miles around, a-huntin' for the
pilgrim's cripus delinkty so he kin go ahead with his arrests."

The eyes of the Texan were fixed on the mountains.  He appeared not
interested.  Twenty feet away in a deep crevice at the edge of the
coulee, Bat Lajune, who had overheard every word, was convulsed with
silent mirth.

"You say they've dug up all the coulees?  Red Rock an'--an' all,
Buffalo, Six-mile, Woodpile, Miller's?"  The Texan shot out the names
with all appearance of nervous haste, but his eye was sombre as before
as he noted the gleam of quick intelligence that flashed into the
cowboy's eyes.  "You're sure they dug up Buffalo?" he pressed shrewdly.

"Yes, I think they finished there."

The Texan gave a visible sigh of relief.  "Say," he asked, presently,
"do you know if they're fordin' at Cow Island this year?"

"Yes, the Two Bar reps come by that way."

"I'm right obliged to you.  I reckon I'll head north, though.  Canada
looks good to me 'til this here wave of virtue blows over.  So long."

"So long, Tex.  An', say, there's some of us friends of yourn that's
goin' to see what we kin do about gettin' them indictments squashed.
We don't want to see you boys doin' time fer stretchin' no pilgrim."

"You won't," answered the Texan.  "Toddle along now an' hunt up Mr.
Kester's horses.  I want room to think."  He permitted himself a broad
smile as the other rode at a gallop toward the mountains, then turned
his horse into the coulee he had just left and allowed him his own pace.

"So Purdy ain't dead," he muttered, "or was that damned fool lyin'?  I
reckon he wasn't lyin' about that, an' the grand jury, an' the district
attorney."  Again he smiled.  "Let's see how I stack up, now: In the
first place, Win ain't on the run, an' I am--or I'm supposed to be.
But, as long as they don't dig Win up out of the bottom of some coulee,
I'm at large for want of a party of the first part to the alleged
felonious snuffin'-out.  Gosh, I bet the boys are havin' fun watchin'
that diggin'.  If I was there I'd put in my nights makin' fresh-dug
spots, an' my days watchin' 'em prospect 'em."  Then his thoughts
turned to the girl, and for miles he rode unheeding.  The sun had swung
well to the westward before the cowboy took notice of his surroundings.
Antelope Butte lay ten or twelve miles away and he headed for it with a
laugh.  "You must have thought I sure enough was headin' for Cow Island
Crossing didn't you, you old dogie chaser?"  He touched his horse
lightly with his spurs and the animal struck into a long swinging trot.

"This here's a mixed-up play all around," he muttered.  "Win's worryin'
about killin' Purdy--says it's got under his hide 'til he thinks about
it nights.  It ain't so much bein' on the run that bothers him as it is
the fact that he's killed a man."  He smiled to himself: "A little
worryin' won't hurt him none.  Any one that would worry over shootin' a
pup like Purdy ought to worry--whether he done it or not.  Then,
there's me.  I start out with designs as evil an' triflin' as
Purdy's--only I ain't a brute--an' I winds up by lovin' her.
Yes--that's the word.  There ain't no mortal use beatin' around the
bush to fool myself.  Spite of silk stockin's she's good clean through.
I reckon, maybe, they're wore more promiscuous in the East.  That Eagle
Creek Ranch, if them corrals was fixed up a little an' them old cattle
sheds tore down, an' the ditches gone over, it would be a good outfit.
If it was taken hold of right, there wouldn't be a better proposition
on the South Slope."  Gloom settled upon the cowboy's face: "But
there's Win.  I started out to show him up."  He smiled grimly.  "Well,
I did.  Only not just exactly as I allowed to.  Lookin' over the
back-trail, I reckon, when us four took to the brush there wasn't only
one damned skunk in the crowd--an' that was me.  It's funny a man can
be that ornery an' never notice it.  But, I bet Bat knew.  He's pure
gold, Bat is.  He's about as prepossessin' to look at as an old gum
boot, but his heart's all there--an' you bet, Bat, he knows."

It was within a quarter of a mile of Antelope Butte that the Texan,
riding along the bottom of a wide coulee met another horseman.  This
time there was no spurring toward him, and he noticed that the man's
hand rested near his right hip.  He shifted his own gun arm and
continued on his course without apparently noticing the other who
approached in the same manner.

Suddenly he laughed: "Hello, Curt!"

"Well, I'm damned if it ain't Tex!  Thought maybe I was going to get
the high-sign."

"Same here."  Both men relaxed from their attitude of alertness, and
Curt leaned closer.

"They ain't dug him up yet," he said, "but they sure are slingin'
gravel.  I hope to God they don't."

"They won't."

"Anything I can do?"

The Texan shook his head: "Nothin', thanks."

"Hot as hell fer June, ain't it."

"Yes; who you ridin' for?"

"K 2."

"K 2!  Mister Kester moved his outfit over to the south slope?"

"Naw.  I'm huntin' a couple of old brood mares Mister Kester bought
offen the Bar A.  They strayed away about a week ago."

"Alone?"

"Might better be," replied the cowboy in tones of disgust.  "I've got
that damned fool, Joe Ainslee, along--or ruther I had him.  Bob
Brumley's foreman of the K 2, now, an' he hired the Wind Bag in a
moment of mental abortion, as the fellow says, an' he don't dast fire
him for fear he'll starve to death.  They wouldn't no other outfit have
him around.  An' I'm thinkin' he'll be damn lucky if he lives long
enough to starve to death.  Bob sent him along with me--said he'd do
less harm than with the round-up, an' would be safer--me bein' amiable
enough not to kill him offhand."

"Ain't you found your mares?"

Curt snorted: "Yes.  Found 'em couple hours ago.  An' now I've lost the
Wind Bag.  Them mares was grazin' right plumb in plain sight of where
I'd sent him circlin', an' doggone if he not only couldn't find 'em,
but he's lost hisself.  An' if he don't show up pretty damn _pronto_ he
kin stay lost--an' the K 2 will win, at that."

The Texan grinned: "Go get your mares, Curt.  The short-horn has
stampeded.  I shouldn't wonder if he's a-foggin' it through the
mountains right now to get himself plumb famous for tippin' off the
district attorney where to do his minin'."

"You seen him!"

"Yes, we had quite a little pow-wow."

"You sure didn't let him git holt of nothin'!"

"Yes.  He's about to bust with the information he gathered.  An' say,
he might of seen them mares an' passed 'em up.  He ain't huntin' no
brood mares, he's after twenty head of young saddle stock--forgot to
mention there was any one with him.  Said it was easy to run
three-year-olds off their own range single handed if you savvied
horses.  Called Mister Kester 'Old Pete' an' told of an orgy they had
mutual in the Long Horn."

Curt burst out laughing: "Can you beat it?"

"I suppose they'll have Red Rock Coulee all mussed up," reflected the
Texan, with a grin.

"You wait 'til I tell the boys."

"Don't you.  They'd hurt him.  He's a-whirlin' a bigger loop than he
can throw, the way it is."

Curt fumbled in his slicker and produced a flask which he tendered.

Tex shook his head: "No thanks, I ain't drinkin'."

"You ain't _what_?"

"No, I'm off of it"; he dismounted and tightened his cinch, and the
other followed his example.

"Off of it!  You ain't sick, or nothin'?"

"No.  Can't a man----?"

"Oh, sure, he could, but he wouldn't, onless--you got your camp near
here?"

Tex was aware the other was eyeing him closely.

"Tolerable."

"Let's go camp then.  I left my pack horse hobbled way up on Last
Water."

The Texan was thinking rapidly.  Curt was a friend of long standing and
desired to share his camp, which is the way of the cow country.  Yet,
manifestly this was impossible.  There was only one way out and that
was to give offence.

"No.  I'm campin' alone these days."

A slow red mounted to the other's face and his voice sounded a trifle
hard: "Come on up to mine, then.  It ain't so far."

"I said I was campin' alone."

The red was very apparent now, and the other took a step forward, and
his words came slowly:

"Peck Maguire told me, an' I shut his dirty mouth for him.  But now I
know it's true.  You're ridin' with the pilgrim's girl."

At the inference the Texan whitened to the eyes.  "_You're a damned
liar_!"  The words came evenly but with a peculiar venom.

Curt half drew his gun.  Then jammed it back in the holster.  "Not
between friends," he said shortly, "but jest the same you're goin' to
eat them words.  It ain't a trick I'd think of you--to run off with a
man's woman after killin' him.  If he was alive it would be different.
I'd ort to shoot it out with you, I suppose, but I can't quite forget
that time in Zortman when you----"

"Don't let that bother you," broke in the Texan with the same evenness
of tone.  "_You're a damned liar_!"

With a bound the man was upon him and Tex saw a blinding flash of
light, and the next moment he was scrambling from the ground.  After
that the fight waxed fast and furious, each man giving and receiving
blows that landed with a force that jarred and rocked.  Then, the Texan
landed heavily upon the point of his opponent's chin and the latter
sank limp to the floor of the coulee.  For a full minute Tex stood
looking down at his victim.

"Curt can scrap like the devil.  I'm sure glad he didn't force no gun
play, I'd have hated to hurt him."  He recovered the flask from the
ground where the other had dropped it, and forced some whiskey between
his lips.  Presently the man opened his eyes.

"Feelin' better?" asked the Texan as Curt blinked up at him.

"Um-hum.  My head aches some."

"Mine, too."

"You got a couple of black eyes, an' your lip is swol up."

"One of yours is turnin' black."

Curt regained his feet and walked slowly toward his horse.  "Well, I'll
be goin'.  So long."

"So long," answered the Texan.  He, too, swung into the saddle and each
rode upon his way.


CHAPTER XVI

BACK IN CAMP

From their place of concealment high upon the edge of Antelope Butte,
Alice Marcum and Endicott watched the movements of the three horsemen
with absorbing interest.  They saw the Texan circle to the
south-eastward and swing north to intercept the trail of the unknown
rider.  They watched Bat, with Indian cunning, creep to his place of
concealment at the edge of the coulee.  They saw the riders disperse,
the unknown to head toward the mountains at a gallop, and the Texan to
turn his horse southward and ride slowly into the bad lands.  And they
watched Bat recover his own horse from behind a rock pinnacle and
follow the Texan, always keeping out of sight in parallel coulees until
both were swallowed up in the amethyst haze of the bad lands.

For an hour they remained in their lookout, pointing out to each other
some new wonder of the landscape--a wind-carved pinnacle, the
heliographic flashing of the mica, or some new combination in the
ever-changing splendour of colours.

"Whew!  But it's hot, and I'm thirsty.  And besides it's lunch time."
Alice rose, and with Endicott following, made her way to the camp.

"Isn't it wonderful?" she breathed, as they ate their luncheon.  "This
life in the open--the pure clean air--the magnificent world all spread
out before you, beckoning you on, and on, and on.  It makes a person
strong with just the feel of living--the joy of it.  Just think,
Winthrop, of being able to eat left-over biscuits and cold bacon and
enjoy it!"

Endicott smiled: "Haven't I improved enough, yet, for 'Win'?--Tex
thinks so."

The girl regarded him critically.  "I have a great deal of respect for
Tex's judgment," she smiled.

"Then, dear, I am going to ask you again, the question I have asked you
times out of number: Will you marry me?"

"Don't spoil it all, now, please.  I am enjoying it so.  Enjoying being
here with just you and the big West.  Oh, this is the real West--the
West of which I've dreamed!"

Endicott nodded: "Yes, this is the West.  You were right, Alice.
California is no more the West than New York is."

"Don't you love it?"  The girl's eyes were shining with enthusiasm.

"Yes.  I love it," he answered, and she noticed that his face was very
grave.  "There must be something--some slumbering ego in every man that
awakens at the voice of the wild places.  Our complex system of
civilization seems to me, as I sit here now, a little thing--a thing,
somehow, remote--unnecessary, and very undesirable."

"Brooklyn seems very far away," murmured the girl.

"And Cincinnati--but not far enough away.  We know they are real--that
they actually exist."  Endicott rose and paced back and forth.
Suddenly he stopped before the girl.  "Marry me, Alice, and I'll buy a
ranch and we will live out here, and for us Brooklyn and Cincinnati
need never exist.  I do love it all, but I love you a thousand times
more."

To Endicott's surprise the girl's eyes dropped before his gaze and
rested for a long time upon the grazing horses--then abruptly she
buried her face in her arms.  The man had half expected a return to the
light half-mocking raillery that had been her staunchest weapon, but
there was nothing even remotely suggestive of raillery in the figure
that huddled at his feet.  Suddenly, his face became very grave:
"Alice," he cried, bending over her, "is it because my hands are red?
Because I have taken a human life, and am flying from the hand of the
law like a common murderer?"

"No, no, no!  Not that?  I----"

Swiftly he gathered her into his arms, but she freed herself and shook
her head in protest.  "Don't please," she pleaded softly.  "Oh, I--I
can't choose."

"Choose!" cried Endicott.  "Then there is--someone else?  You have
found--" he stopped abruptly and drew a long breath.  "I see," he said,
gently, "I think I understand."

The unexpected gentleness of the voice caused the girl to raise her
head.  Endicott stood as he had stood a moment before, but his gaze was
upon the far mountains.  The girl's eyes were wet with tears: "Yes,
I--he loves me--and he asked me to marry him.  He said I would marry
either you or him, and he would wait for me to decide--until I was
sure."  Her voice steadied, and Endicott noticed that it held a trace
of defensive.  "He's a dear, and--I know--way down in his heart he's
good--he's----"

Endicott smiled: "Yes, little girl, he is good.  He's a man--every inch
of him.  And he's a man among men.  He's honest and open hearted and
human.  There is not a mean hair in his head.  And he stands a great
deal nearer the top of his profession than I do to the top of mine.  I
have been a fool, Alice.  I can see now what a complacent fool and a
cad I must have been--when I could look at these men and see nothing
but uncouthness.  But, thank God, men can change----"

Impulsively the girl reached for his hand: "No," she murmured,
remembering the words of the Texan, "no, the man was there all the
time.  The real man that is _you_ was concealed by the unreal man that
is superficiality."

"Thank you, Alice," he said gravely.  "And for your sake--and I say it
an all sincerity--let the best man win!"

The girl smiled up into his face: "And in all sincerity I will say that
in all your life you have never seemed so--so marryable as you do right
now."

While Endicott cut a supply of fire-wood and tinkered about the spring,
the girl made a complete circuit of the little plateau, and as the
shadows began to lengthen they once more climbed to their lookout
station.  For an hour the vast corrugated plane before them showed no
sign of life.  Suddenly the girl's fingers clutched Endicott's arm and
she pointed to a lone horseman who rode from the north.

"I wonder if he's the same one we saw before--the one who rode away so
fast?"

"Not unless he has changed horses," answered Endicott.  "The other rode
a grey."

The man swung from his horse and seemed to be minutely studying the
ground.  Then he mounted and headed down the coulee at a trot.

"Look!  There is Tex!" cried Endicott, and he pointed farther down the
same coulee.  A sharp bend prevented either rider from noticing the
approach of the other.

"Oh, I wonder who it is, and what will happen when they see each
other?" cried the girl.  "Look!  There is Bat.  Near the top of that
ridge.  He's cutting across so he'll be right above them when they
meet."  She was leaning forward watching: breathlessly the movements of
the three horsemen.  "It is unreal.  Just like some great spectacular
play.  You see the actors moving through their parts and you wonder
what is going to happen next and how it is all going to work out."

"There!  They see each other!" Endicott exclaimed.  Each horseman
pulled up, hesitated a moment, and rode on.  Distance veiled from the
eager onlookers the significant detail of the shifted gun arms.  But no
such preclusion obstructed Bat's vision as he lay flattened upon the
rim of the coulee with the barrel of his six-gun resting upon the edge
of a rock, and its sights lined low upon the stranger's armpit.

"They've dismounted," observed Alice, "I believe Tex is going to
unsaddle."

"Tightening his cinch," ventured Endicott, and was interrupted by a cry
from the lips of the girl.

"Look!  The other!  He's going to shoot----  Why, they're fighting!"
Fighting they certainly were, and Endicott stared in surprise as he saw
the Texan knocked down and then spring to his feet and attack his
assailant with a vigour that rendered impossible any further attempt to
follow the progress of the combat.

"Why doesn't Bat shoot, or go down there and help him?" cried the girl,
as with clenched fists she strained her eyes in a vain effort to see
who was proving the victor.

"This does not seem to be a shooting affair," Endicott answered, "and
it is my own private opinion that Tex is abundantly able to take care
of himself.  Ah--he got him that time!  He's down for the count!  Good
work, Tex, old man!  A good clean knockout!"

The two watched as the men mounted and rode their several ways--the
stranger swinging northward toward the mountains, and the Texan
following along the south face of the butte.

"Some nice little meetings they have out here," grinned Endicott.  "I
wonder if the vanquished one was a horse-thief or just an ordinary
friend."

Alice returned the smile: "You used to rather go in for boxing in
college, didn't you?"

"Oh, yes.  I can hold my own when it comes to fists----

"And--you can shoot."

The man shook his head: "Do you know that was the first time I ever
fired a pistol in my life.  I don't like to think about it.  And yet--I
am always thinking about it!  I have killed a man--have taken a human
life.  I did it without malice--without forethought.  All I knew was
that you were in danger, then I saw him fling you from him--the pistol
was in my hand, and I fired."

"You need have no regrets," answered the girl, quickly.  "It was his
life or both of ours--worse than that--a thousand times worse."

Endicott was silent as the two turned toward the plateau.  "Why,
there's Bat's horse, trotting over to join the others, and unsaddled,
too," cried Alice.  "He has beaten Tex to camp.  Bat is a dear, and he
just adores the ground Tex walks on, or 'rides on' would be more
appropriate, for I don't think he ever walked more than a hundred feet
in his life."

Sure enough, when they reached camp there sat the half-breed placidly
mending a blanket, with the bored air of one upon whom time hangs
heavily.  He looked up as Endicott greeted him.

"Mebbe-so dat better you don' say nuttin' 'bout A'm gon' 'way from
here," he grinned.  "Tex she com' 'long pret' queek, now.  Mebbe-so he
t'ink dat better A'm stay roun' de camp.  But _Voila_!  How A'm know he
ain' gon for git hurt?"

"But he did--"  Alice paused abruptly with the sentences unfinished,
for the sound of galloping hoofs reached her ears and she looked up to
see the Texan swing from his horse, strip off the saddle and bridle and
turn the animal loose.

"Oh," she cried, as the man joined them after spreading his saddle
blanket to dry.  "Your eyes are swollen almost shut and your lip is
bleeding!"

"Yes," answered the cowboy with a contortion of the stiff, swollen lip
that passed for a smile.  "I rounded the bend in a coulee down yonder
an' run plumb against a hard projection."

"They certainly are hard--I have run against those projections myself,"
grinned Endicott.  "You see, we had what you might call ringside seats,
and I noticed that it didn't take you very long to come back with some
mighty stiff projecting yourself."

"Yes.  Him pastin' me between the eyes that way, I took as an
onfriendly act, an' one I resented."

"That wallop you landed on his chin was a beautiful piece of work."

"Yes, quite comely."  The cowboy wriggled his fingers painfully.  "But
these long-horns that's raised on salt-horse an' rawhide, maintains a
jaw on 'em that makes iron an' granite seem right mushy.  I didn't
figure I'd recount the disturbance, aimin' to pass it off casual
regardin' the disfigurin' of my profile.  But if you-all witnessed the
debate, I might as well go ahead an' oncork the details.  In the first
place, this warrior is a deputy that's out after Win."

The Texan glanced sharply at Bat who became suddenly seized with a fit
of coughing, but the face of the half-breed was impassive--even sombre
as he worked at the blanket.  "It's all owin' to politics," continued
the cowpuncher, rolling and lighting a cigarette.  "Politics, an' the
fact that the cow country is in its dotage.  Choteau County is growin'
effeminate, not to say right down effete when a lynchin', that by
rights it would be stretching its importance even to refer to it in
conversation, is raised to the dignity of a political issue.  As
everyone knows, a hangin' is always a popular play, riddin' the
community of an ondesirable, an' at the same time bein' a warnin' to
others to polish up their rectitude.  But it seems, from what I was
able to glean, that this particular hangin' didn't win universal
acclaim, owin' to the massacre of Purdy not bein' deplored none."

Once more the half-breed emitted a strangling cough, and Tex eyed him
narrowly.  "Somethin' seems to ail your throat."

"_Oui_, A'm swal' de piece tabac'."

"Well just hang onto it 'til it gets a little darker an' we'll have
supper," said the Texan, dryly, and resumed.

"So there was some talk disparagin' to the lynchin', an' the party
that's in, holdin' its tenure by the skin of its teeth, an' election
comin' on, sided in with public opinion an' frowned on the lynchin',
not as a hangin', you onderstand, but because the hangin' didn't
redound none to their particular credit--it not being legal an'
regular.  All this is brewed while the dance is goin' on, an' by
breakfast time next mornin', there bein' a full quorum of Republican
war chiefs on hand, they pulls a pow-wow an' instructs their deputies
to round up the lynchers.  This is done, barrin' a few that's flitted,
the boys bein' caught unawares.  Well, things begun lookin' serious to
'em, an' as a last resort they decided to fall back on the truth.  So
they admits that there ain't no lynchin'.  They tells how, after they'd
got out on the bench a piece they got to thinkin' that the demise of
Purdy ain't a serious matter, nohow, so they turned him loose.  'Where
is he, then?' says a county commissioner.  'Search us,' replies the
culprits.  'We just turned him loose an' told him to _vamoose_.  We
didn't stick around an' herd him!'"  Again Bat coughed, and the Texan
glared at him.

"Maybe a drink of water would help them lacerated pipes of yourn," he
suggested, "an' besides it's dark enough so you can start supper
a-goin'."

"But," said Endicott, "won't that get the boys all into serious trouble
for aiding and abetting a prisoner to escape?  Accessories after the
fact, is what the law calls them."

"Oh Lord," groaned the Texan inwardly.  "If I can steer through all
this without ridin' into my own loop, I'll be some liar.  This on top
of what I told 'em in Wolf River, an' since, an' about Purdy's
funeral--I dastn't bog down, now!"

"No," he answered, as he lighted another cigarette.  "There comes in
your politics again.  You see, there was twenty-some-odd of us--an'
none friendless.  Take twenty-odd votes an' multiply 'em by the number
of friends each has got--an' I reckon ten head of friends apiece
wouldn't overshoot the figure--an' you've got between two hundred an'
three hundred votes--which is a winnin' majority for any candidate
among 'em.  Knowin' this, they wink at the jail delivery an' cinch
those votes.  But, as I said before, hangin' is always a popular
measure, an' as they want credit for yourn, they start all the deputies
they got out on a still-hunt for you, judgin' it not to be hard to find
a pilgrim wanderin' about at large.  An' this party I met up with was
one of 'em."

"Did he suspect that we were with you?" asked Alice, her voice
trembling with anxiety.

"Such was the case--his intimation bein' audible, and venomous.  I
denied it in kind, an' one word leadin' to another, he called me a
liar.  To which statement, although to a certain extent veracious, I
took exception, an' in the airy persiflage that ensued, he took umbrage
to an extent that it made him hostile.  Previous to this little
altercation, he an' I had been good friends, and deemin', rightly, that
it wasn't a shootin' matter, he ondertook to back up his play with his
fists, and he hauled off an' smote me between the eyes before I'd
devined his intentions.  Judgin' the move unfriendly, not to say right
downright aggressive, I come back at him with results you-all noted.
An' that's all there was to the incident of me showin' up with black
eyes, an' a lip that would do for a pin cushion."

All during supper and afterward while the half-breed was washing the
dishes, the Texan eyed him sharply, and several times caught the flash
of a furtive smile upon the habitually sombre face.

"He knows somethin' mirthful," thought the cowboy, "I noticed it
particular, when I was flounderin' up to my neck in the mire of
deception.  The old reprobate ain't easy amused, either."

Alice retired early, and before long Endicott, too, sought his
blankets.  The moon rose, and the Texan strolled over to the grazing
horses.  Returning, he encountered Bat seated upon a rock at some
distance from camp, watching him.  The half-breed was grinning openly
now, broadly, and with evident enjoyment.  Tex regarded him with a
frown: "For a Siwash you're plumb mirthful an' joyous minded.  In fact
I ain't noticed any one so wrapped up in glee for quite a spell.
Suppose you just loosen up an' let me in on the frivolity, an' at the
same time kind of let it appear where you put in the day.  I mistrusted
my packin' a pair of purple ones wouldn't give you the whoopin' cough,
so I just sauntered over an' took a look at the cayuses.  Yourn's be'n
rode 'til he's sweat under the blanket--an' he ain't soft neither."

"_Oui_, A'm fol' 'long we'n you make de ride.  A'm t'ink mebbe-so two
better'n wan."

"Well, I was weaned right young, an' I don't need no governess.  After
this you----"

The half-breed shrugged: "A'm tink dat tam way back in Las Vegas dat
dam' good t'ing ol' Bat fol' 'long, or else, ba Goss, you gon' to hell
for sure."

"But that's no sign I've always got to be close-herded.  Did you sneak
up near enough to hear what the short-horn said?"

"_Oui_, A'm hear dat.  She mak' me laugh lak' hell."

"Laugh!  I didn't see nothin' so damn hilarious in it.  What do you
think about Purdy?"

"A'm tink dat dam' bad luck she no git keel."  The half-breed paused
and grinned: "De pilgrim she mak' de run for nuttin', an' you got to
ke'p on lyin' an' lyin', an bye-m-bye you got so dam' mooch lies you
git los'.  So far, dat work out pret' good.  De pilgrim gon' ke'p on de
run, 'cause he no lak' for git stretch for politick, an' you git mor'
chance for make de play for de girl."

"What do you mean?"  The Texan's eyes flashed.  "I just knocked the
livin' hell out of one fellow for makin' a crack about that girl."

"_Oui_, A'm know 'bout dat, too.  Dat was pret' good, but nex' tam dat
better you start in fightin' fore you git knock clean across de coulee
firs'.  A'm lak dat girl.  She dam' fine 'oman, you bet.  A'm no lak'
she git harm."

"See here, Bat," interrupted the Texan, "no matter what my intentions
were when I started out, they're all right now."

"_Oui_, A'm know dat, 'bout two day."

"It's this way, I be'n thinkin' quite a bit the last couple of days
there ain't a thing in hellin' around the country punchin' other folks'
cattle for wages.  It's time I was settlin' down.  If that girl will
take a long shot an' marry me, I'm goin' to rustle around an' start an
outfit of my own.  I'll be needin' a man about your heft an' complexion
to help me run it, too--savvy?"

The half-breed nodded slowly.  "_Oui_, all de tam A'm say: 'Some tam
Tex she queet de dam' foolin', an' den she git to be de beeg man.'  I
ain' tink you git dis 'oman, but dat don' mak' no differ', som' tam you
be de beeg man yet.  Som' nodder 'oman com' 'long----"

"To hell with some other woman!" flared the Texan.  "I tell you I'll
have that girl or I'll never look at another woman.  There ain't
another woman in the world can touch her.  You think you're wise as
hell, but I'll show you!"

The half-breed regarded him gloomily: "A'm tink dat 'oman de pilgrim
'oman."

"Oh, you do, do you?  Well, just you listen to me.  She ain't--not yet.
It's me an' the pilgrim for her.  If she ties to him instead of me,
it's all right.  She'll get a damn good man.  Take me, an' all of a
sudden throw me into the middle of _his_ country, an' I doubt like hell
if I'd show up as good as he did in mine.  Whatever play goes on
between me an' the pilgrim, will be on the square--with one deck, an'
the cards on the table.  There's only one thing I'm holdin' out on him,
an' that is about Purdy.  An' that ain't an onfair advantage, because
it's his own fault he's worryin' about it.  An' if it gives me a better
chance with her, I'm goin' to grab it.  An' I'll win, too.  But, if I
don't win, I don't reckon it'll kill me.  Sometimes when I get to
thinkin' about it I almost wish it would--I'm that damned close to
bein' yellow."

Bat laughed.  The idea of the Texan being yellow struck him as
humorous.  "I'm wonder how mooch more beeg lie you got for tell, eh?"

Tex was grinning now, "Search me.  I had to concoct some excuse for
getting 'em started--two or three excuses.  An' it looks like I got to
keep on concoctin' 'em to keep 'em goin'.  But it don't hurt no
one--lyin' like that, don't.  It don't hurt the girl, because she's
bound to get one of us.  It don't hurt the pilgrim, because we'll see
him through to the railroad.  It don't hurt you, because you don't
believe none of it.  An' it don't hurt me, because I'm used to it--an'
there you are.  But that don't give you no license to set around an'
snort an' gargle while I'm tellin' 'em.  I got trouble enough keepin'
'em plausible an' entangled, without you keepin' me settin' on a cactus
for fear you'll give it away.  What you got to do is to back up my
play--remember them four bits I give you way back in Los Vegas?  Well,
here's where I'm givin' you a chance to pay dividends on them four
bits."

Bat grinned: "You go 'head an' mak' you play.  You fin' out I ain't
forgit dat four bit.  She ain' mooch money--four bit ain'.  But w'en
she all you got, she wan hell of a lot . . . _bien_!"


CHAPTER XVII

IN THE BAD LANDS

It was well toward noon on the following day when the four finally
succeeded in locating the grub cache of the departed horse-thief.  Nearly
two years had passed since the man had described the place to Tex and a
two-year-old description of a certain small, carefully concealed cavern
in a rock-wall pitted with innumerable similar caverns is a mighty
slender peg to hang hopes upon.

"It's like searching for buried treasure!" exclaimed Alice as she pried
and prodded among the rocks with a stout stick.

"There won't be much treasure, even if we find the _cache_," smiled Tex.
"Horse thievin' had got onpopular to the extent there wasn't hardly a
livin' in it long before this specimen took it up as a profession.  We'll
be lucky if we find any grub in it."

A few moments later Bat unearthed the _cache_ and, as the others crowded
about, began to draw out its contents.

"Field mice," growled Tex, as the half-breed held up an empty canvas bag
with its corner gnawed to shreds.  Another gnawed bag followed, and
another.

"We don't draw no flour, nor rice, not jerky, anyhow," said the puncher,
examining the bags.  "Nor bacon, either.  The only chance we stand to
make a haul is on the air-tights."

"What are air-tights?" asked the girl.

"Canned stuff--tomatoes are the best for this kind of weather--keep you
from gettin' thirsty.  I've be'n in this country long enough to pretty
much know its habits, but I never saw it this hot in June."

"She feel lak' dat dam' Yuma bench, but here is only de rattlesnake.  We
don' got to all de tam hont de pizen boog.  Dat ain' no good for git so
dam' hot--she burn' oop de range.  If it ain' so mooch danger for Win to
git hang--"  He paused and looked at Tex with owlish solemnity.  "A'm no
lak we cross dem bad lands.  Better A'm lak we gon' back t'rough de
mountaine."

"You dig out them air-tights, if there's any in there, an' quit your
croakin'!" ordered the cowboy.

And with a grin Bat thrust in his arm to the shoulder.  One by one he
drew out the tins--eight in all, and laid them in a row.  The labels had
disappeared and the Texan stood looking down at them.

"Anyway we have these," smiled the girl, but the cowboy shook his head.

"Those big ones are tomatoes, an' the others are corn, an' peas--but, it
don't make any difference."  He pointed to the cans in disgust: "See
those ends bulged out that way?  If we'd eat any of the stuff in those
cans we'd curl up an' die, _pronto_.  Roll 'em back, Bat, we got grub
enough without 'em.  Two days will put us through the bad lands an' we've
got plenty.  We'll start when the moon comes up."

The fund for this disgraceful purpose was known as the "Mediterranean
fund," and was intrusted to the Secretary of State to be disbursed
by him in his discretion. After we had our brush with France, however, in
1798, and after Truxtun's brilliant victory over the French frigate
L'Insurgente in the following year, it occurred to our government that
perhaps there was a more direct as well as a more manly way of dealing
with the Barbary pirates than by feebly paying them tribute, and
in 1801 a small squadron, under Commodore Dale, proceeded to the
Mediterranean.

At the same time events occurred which showed strikingly the absurdity
as well as the weakness of this policy of paying blackmail to pirates.
The Bashaw of Tripoli, complaining that we had given more money to some
of the Algerian ministers than we had to him, and also that we had
presented Algiers with a frigate, declared war upon us, and cut down
the flag-staff in front of the residence of the American consul.
At the same time, and for the same reason, Morocco and Tunis began
to grumble at the treatment which they had received.

The fact was that, with nations as with individuals, when the payment
of blackmail is once begun there is no end to it. The appearance,
however, of our little squadron in the Mediterranean showed at
once the superiority of a policy of force over one of cowardly
submission.

Morocco and Tunis immediately stopped their grumbling and came to
terms with the United States, and this left us free to deal with
Tripoli.

Commodore Dale had sailed before the declaration of war by Tripoli was
known, and he was therefore hampered by his orders, which permitted him
only to protect our commerce, and which forbade actual hostilities.

Nevertheless, even under these limited orders, the Enterprise, of twelve
guns, commanded by Lieutenant Sterrett, fought an action with the Tripolitan
ship Tripoli, of fourteen guns. The engagement lasted three hours, when
the Tripoli struck, having lost her mizzenmast, and with twenty
of her crew killed and thirty wounded.

Sterrett, having no orders to make captures, threw all the guns and
ammunition of the Tripoli overboard, cut away her remaining masts,
and left her with only one spar and a single sail to drift back to
Tripoli, as a hint to the Bashaw of the new American policy.

In 1803 the command of our fleet in the Mediterranean was taken by
Commodore Preble, who had just succeeded in forcing satisfaction
from Morocco for an attack made upon our merchantmen by a vessel
from Tangier.

He also proclaimed a blockade of Tripoli and was preparing to enforce it
when the news reached him that the frigate Philadelphia, forty-four
guns, commanded by Captain Bainbridge, and one of the best ships
in our navy, had gone upon a reef in the harbor of Tripoli, while
pursuing a vessel there, and had been surrounded and captured, with
all her crew, by the Tripolitan gunboats, when she was entirely
helpless either to fight or sail.

This was a very serious blow to our navy and to our operations against
Tripoli. It not only weakened our forces, but it was also a great help
to the enemy.

The Tripolitans got the Philadelphia off the rocks, towed her into the
harbor, and anchored her close under the guns of their forts. They also
replaced her batteries, and prepared to make her ready for sea,
where she would have been a most formidable danger to our shipping.

Under these circumstances Stephen Decatur, a young lieutenant in command
of the Enterprise, offered to Commodore Preble to go into the
harbor and destroy the Philadelphia.

Some delay ensued, as our squadron was driven by severe gales from the
Tripolitan coast; but at last, in January, 1804, Preble gave orders to
Decatur to undertake the work for which he had volunteered.

A small vessel known as a ketch had been recently captured from the
Tripolitans by Decatur, and this prize was now named the Intrepid,
and assigned to him for the work he had in hand.

He took seventy men from his own ship, the Enterprise, and put
them on the Intrepid, and then, accompanied by Lieutenant Stewart in
the Siren, who was to support him, he set sail for Tripoli. He and his
crew were very much cramped as well as badly fed on the little
vessel which had been given to them, but they succeeded, nevertheless,
in reaching Tripoli in safety, accompanied by the Siren.

For nearly a week they were unable to approach the harbor, owing to severe
gales which threatened the loss of their vessel; but on February 16 the
weather moderated and Decatur determined to go in. It is well to recall,
briefly, the extreme peril of the attack which he was about to make. The
Philadelphia, with forty guns mounted, double-shotted, and ready for
firing, and manned by a full complement of men, was moored within
half a gunshot of the Bashaw's castle, the mole and crown batteries,
and within range of ten other batteries, mounting, altogether, one
hundred and fifteen guns.

Some Tripolitan cruisers, two galleys, and nineteen gunboats also lay
between the Philadelphia and the shore. Into the midst of this powerful
armament Decatur had to go with his little vessel of sixty tons, carrying
four small guns and having a crew of seventy-five men.

The Americans, however, were entirely undismayed by the odds against
them, and at seven o'clock Decatur went into the harbor between the reef
and shoal which formed its mouth. He steered on steadily toward the
Philadelphia, the breeze getting constantly lighter, and by half-past
nine was within two hundred yards of the frigate.

As they approached Decatur stood at the helm with the pilot, only two or
three men showing on deck and the rest of the crew lying hidden under the
bulwarks. In this way he drifted to within nearly twenty yards of the
Philadelphia.
The suspicions of the Tripolitans, however, were not aroused, and when
they hailed the Intrepid, the pilot answered that they had lost their
anchors in a gale, and asked that they might run a warp to the frigate
and ride by her. While the talk went on the Intrepid's boat shoved off
with the rope, and pulling to the fore-chains of the Philadelphia, made
the line fast. A few of the crew then began to haul on the lines, and
thus the Intrepid was drawn gradually toward the frigate.

The suspicions of the Tripolitans were now at last awakened. They raised
the cry of "Americanos!" and ordered off the Intrepid, but it
was too late. As the vessels came in contact, Decatur sprang up the
main chains of the Philadelphia, calling out the order to board.

He was rapidly followed by his officers and men, and as they swarmed over
the rails and came upon the deck, the Tripolitan crew gathered,
panic-stricken, in a confused mass on the forecastle. Decatur waited a
moment until his men were behind him, and then, placing himself at their
head, drew his sword and rushed upon the Tripolitans. There was a very
short struggle, and the Tripolitans, crowded together, terrified and
surprised, were cut down or driven overboard. In five minutes
the ship was cleared of the enemy.

Decatur would have liked to have taken the Philadelphia out of the
harbor, but that was impossible.

He therefore gave orders to burn the ship, and his men, who had
been thoroughly instructed in what they were to do, dispersed into
all parts of the frigate with the combustibles which had been
prepared, and in a few minutes, so well and quickly was the work
done, the flames broke out in all parts of the Philadelphia.

As soon as this was effected the order was given to return to the
Intrepid.
Without confusion the men obeyed. It was a moment of great danger, for
fire was breaking out on all sides, and the Intrepid herself, filled
as she was with powder and combustibles, was in great peril of
sudden destruction.

The rapidity of Decatur's movements, however, saved everything. The
cables were cut, the sweeps got out, and the Intrepid drew rapidly away
from the burning frigate. It was a magnificent sight as the flames burst
out over the Philadephia and ran rapidly and fiercely up the masts and
rigging. As her guns became heated they were discharged, one battery
pouring its shots into the town.

Finally the cables parted, and then the Philadelphia, a mass of flames,
drifted across the harbor, and blew up. Meantime the batteries of the
shipping and the castle had been turned upon the Intrepid, but although
the shot struck all around her, she escaped successfully with only one
shot through her mainsail, and, joining the Siren, bore away.

This successful attack was carried through by the cool courage of Decatur
and the admirable discipline of his men. The hazard was very great, the
odds were very heavy, and everything depended on the nerve with which
the attack was made and the completeness of the surprise.
Nothing miscarried, and no success could have been more complete.

Nelson, at that time in the Mediterranean, and the best judge of a naval
exploit as well as the greatest naval commander who has ever lived,
pronounced it "the most bold and daring act of the age." We meet no
single feat exactly like it in our own naval history, brilliant as
that has been, until we come to Cushing's destruction of the Albemarle
in the war of the rebellion. In the years that have elapsed, and among
the great events that have occurred since that time, Decatur's burning
of the Philadephia has been well-nigh forgotten; but it is one of those
feats of arms which illustrate the high courage of American seamen,
and which ought always to be remembered.

THE CRUISE OF THE "WASP"
A crash as when some swollen cloud Cracks o'er the tangled trees!
With side to side, and spar to spar, Whose smoking decks are these?

I know St. George's blood-red cross, Thou mistress of the seas, But
what is she whose streaming bars Roll out before the breeze?

Ah, well her iron ribs are knit, Whose thunders strive to quell The
bellowing throats, the blazing lips, That pealed the Armada's knell!
The mist was cleared,--a wreath of stars Rose o'er the crimsoned swell,
And, wavering from its haughty peak, The cross of England fell!
--Holmes.

In the war of 1812 the little American navy, including only a dozen
frigates and sloops of war, won a series of victories against the English,
the hitherto undoubted masters of the sea, that attracted an attention
altogether out of proportion to the force of the combatants or the
actual damage done.

For one hundred and fifty years the English ships of war had failed
to find fit rivals in those of any other European power, although
they had been matched against each in turn; and when the unknown
navy of the new nation growing up across the Atlantic did what no
European navy had ever been able to do, not only the English and
Americans, but the people of Continental Europe as well, regarded
the feat as important out of all proportion to the material aspects
of the case.

The Americans first proved that the English could be beaten at their own
game on the sea. They did what the huge fleets of France, Spain, and
Holland had failed to do, and the great modern writers on naval warfare
in Continental Europe--men like Jurien de la Graviere--have paid the same
attention to these contests of frigates and sloops that they give to whole
fleet actions of other wars.

Among the famous ships of the Americans in this war were two named the Wasp.
The first was an eighteen-gun ship-sloop, which at the very outset of the
war captured a British brig-sloop of twenty guns, after an engagement
in which the British fought with great gallantry, but were knocked
to Pieces, while the Americans escaped comparatively unscathed.

Immediately afterward a British seventy-four captured the victor. In
memory of her the Americans gave the same name to one of the new sloops
they were building. These sloops were stoutly made, speedy vessels which
in strength and swiftness compared favorably with any ships of their
class in any other navy of the day, for the American shipwrights were
already as famous as the American gunners and seamen. The new Wasp,
like her sister ships, carried twenty-two guns and a crew of one hundred
and seventy men, and was ship-rigged. Twenty of her guns were 32-pound
carronades, while for bow-chasers she had two "long Toms."

It was in the year 1814 that the Wasp sailed from the United States to
prey on the navy and commerce of Great Britain. Her commander was a
gallant South Carolinian named Captain Johnson Blakeley. Her crew were
nearly all native Americans, and were an exceptionally fine set of
men. Instead of staying near the American coasts or of sailing the high
seas, the Wasp at once headed boldly for the English Channel, to carry
the war to the very doors of the enemy.

At that time the English fleets had destroyed the navies of every other
power of Europe, and had obtained such complete supremacy over the
French that the French fleets were kept in port.

Off these ports lay the great squadrons of the English ships of the line,
never, in gale or in calm, relaxing their watch upon the rival
war-ships of the French emperor. So close was the blockade of the French
ports, and so hopeless were the French of making headway in battle
with their antagonists, that not only the great French three-deckers
and two-deckers, but their frigates and sloops as well, lay harmless
in their harbors, and the English ships patroled the seas unchecked
in every direction.

A few French privateers still slipped out now and then, and the far
bolder and more formidable American privateersmen drove hither and
thither across the ocean in their swift schooners and brigantines,
and harried the English commerce without mercy.

The Wasp proceeded at once to cruise in the English Channel and off
the coasts of England, France, and Spain. Here the water was traversed
continually by English fleets and squadrons and single ships of
war, which were sometimes covoying detachments of troops for Wellington's
Peninsular army, sometimes guarding fleets of merchant vessels bound
homeward, and sometimes merely cruising for foes.

It was this spot, right in the teeth of the British naval power,
that the Wasp chose for her cruising ground.

Hither and thither she sailed through the narrow seas, capturing and
destroying the merchantmen, and by the seamanship of her crew and
the skill and vigilance of her commander, escaping the pursuit of
frigate and ship of the line.

Before she had been long on the ground, one June morning, while in chase
of a couple of merchant ships, she spied a sloop of war, the British
brig Reindeer, of eighteen guns and a hundred and twenty men. The
Reindeer was a weaker ship than the Wasp, her guns were lighter,
and her men fewer; but her commander, Captain Manners, was one of
the most gallant men in the splendid British navy, and he promptly
took up the gage of battle which the Wasp threw down.

The day was calm and nearly still; only a light wind stirred across the
sea. At one o'clock the Wasp's drum beat to quarters, and the sailors
and marines gathered at their appointed posts. The drum of the Reindeer
responded to the challenge, and with her sails reduced to fighting
trim, her guns run out, and every man ready, she came down upon the
Yankee ship.

On her forecastle she had rigged a light carronade, and coming up from
behind, she five times discharged this pointblank into the American
sloop; then in the light air the latter luffed round, firing her guns as
they bore, and the two ships engaged yard-arm to yard-arm. The guns
leaped and thundered as the grimy gunners hurled them out to fire and
back again to load, working like demons.

For a few minutes the cannonade was tremendous, and the men in the tops
could hardly see the decks for the wreck of flying splinters. Then
the vessels ground together, and through the open ports the rival gunners
hewed, hacked, and thrust at one another, while the black smoke curled up
from between the hulls. The English were suffering terribly. Captain
Manners himself was wounded, and realizing that he was doomed to defeat
unless by some desperate effort he could avert it, he gave the signal
to board. At the call the boarders gathered, naked to the waist, black
with powder and spattered with blood, cutlas and pistol in hand. But the
Americans were ready.
Their marines were drawn up on deck, the pikemen stood behind the bulwarks,
and the officers watched, cool and alert, every movement of the foe.
Then the British sea-dogs tumbled aboard, only to perish by shot or
steel. The combatants slashed and stabbed with savage fury, and the
assailants were driven back. Manners sprang to their head to lead them
again himself, when a ball fired by one of the sailors in the
American tops crashed through his skull, and he fell, sword in hand,
with his face to the foe, dying as honorable a death as ever a brave
man died in fighting against odds for the flag of his country.

As he fell the American officers passed the word to board. With wild cheers
the fighting sailormen sprang forward, sweeping the wreck of the British
force before them, and in a minute the Reindeer was in their
possession.

All of her officers, and nearly two thirds of the crew, were killed
or wounded; but they had proved themselves as skilful as they were
brave, and twenty-six of the Americans had been killed or wounded.

The Wasp set fire to her prize, and after retiring to a French port to
refit, came out again to cruise.

For some time she met no antagonist of her own size with which to wage
war, and she had to exercise the sharpest vigilance to escape capture.
Late one September afternoon, when she could see ships of war
all around her, she selected one which was isolated from the others,
and decided to run alongside her and try to sink her after nightfall.
Accordingly she set her sails in pursuit, and drew steadily toward her
antagonist, a big eighteen-gun brig, the Avon, a ship more powerful
than the Reindeer.

The Avon kept signaling to two other British war vessels which were in
sight--one an eighteen-gun brig and the other a twenty-gun ship; they were
so close that the Wasp was afraid they would interfere before the combat
could be ended.
Nevertheless, Blakeley persevered, and made his attack with equal
skill and daring.

It was after dark when he ran alongside his opponent, and they began forthwith
to exchange furious broadsides. As the ships plunged and wallowed in
the seas, the Americans could see the clusters of topmen in the rigging
of their opponent, but they knew nothing of the vessel's name or of her
force, save only so far as they felt it. The firing was fast and furious,
but the British shot with bad aim, while the skilled American gunners
hulled their opponent at almost every discharge. In a very few minutes the
Avon was in a sinking condition, and she struck her flag and cried for
quarter, having lost forty or fifty men, while but three of the
Americans had fallen.

Before the Wasp could take possession of her opponent, however, the two
war vessels to which the Avon had been signaling came up. One of them
fired at the Wasp, and as the latter could not fight two new foes,
she ran off easily before the wind.

Neither of her new antagonists followed her, devoting themselves to
picking up the crew of the sinking Avon.

It would be hard to find a braver feat more skilfully performed than this;
for Captain Blakeley, with hostile foes all round him, had closed with and
sunk one antagonist not greatly his inferior in force, suffering hardly
any loss himself, while two of her friends were coming to her help.

Both before and after this the Wasp cruised hither and thither making prizes.
Once she came across a convoy of ships bearing arms and munitions to
Wellington's army, under the care of a great two-decker.

Hovering about, the swift sloop evaded the two-decker's movements,
and actually cut out and captured one of the transports she was
guarding, making her escape unharmed. Then she sailed for the high
seas. She made several other prizes, and on October 9 spoke a Swedish
brig.

This was the last that was ever heard of the gallant Wasp. She never again
appeared, and no trace of any of those aboard her was ever found.
Whether she was wrecked on some desert coast, whether she foundered in some
furious gale, or what befell her none ever knew.

All that is certain is that she perished, and that all on board her
met death in some one of the myriad forms in which it must always
be faced by those who go down to the sea in ships; and when she
sank there sank one of the most gallant ships of the American navy,
with as brave a captain and crew as ever sailed from any port of
the New World.

THE "GENERAL ARMSTRONG" PRIVATEER
We have fought such a fight for a day and a night As may never be fought
again!

We have won great glory, my men!

And a day less or more At sea or ashore, We die--does it matter when?
--Tennyson.

In the revolution, and again in the war of 1812, the seas were covered
by swift-sailing American privateers, which preyed on the British trade.
The hardy seamen of the New England coast, and of New York,
Philadelphia, and Baltimore, turned readily from their adventurous
careers in the whalers that followed the giants of the ocean in
every sea and every clime, and from trading voyages to the uttermost
parts of the earth, to go into the business of privateering, which
was more remunerative, and not so very much more dangerous, than
their ordinary pursuits.

By the end of the war of 1812, in particular, the American privateers
had won for themselves a formidable position on the ocean.

The smile died from the cowboy's face: "It ain't that, Win.  I guess you
don't savvy, but I do.  She's yours, man.  Take her an' go!  There was a
while that I thought--but, hell!"

"I'm not so sure of that," Endicott replied.  "Only yesterday, or the day
before, she told me she could not choose--yet."

"She'll choose," answered Tex, "an' she won't choose--me.  She ain't
makin' no mistake, neither.  By God, I know a man when I see one!"

Endicott stepped forward and shook his fist in the cowboy's face: "It's
the only chance.  You can do it--I can't.  For God's sake, man, be
sensible!  Either of us would do it--for her.  It is only a question of
success, and all that it means; and failure--and all that that means.
You know the country--I don't.  You are experienced in fighting this
damned desert--I'm not.  Any one of a dozen things might mean the
difference between life and death.  You would take advantage of them--I
couldn't."

"You're a lawyer, Win--an' a damn good one.  I wondered what your trade
was.  If I ever run foul of the law, I'll sure send for you, _pronto_.
If I was a jury you'd have me plumb convinced--but, I ain't a jury.  The
way I look at it, the case stands about like this: We can't stay here,
and there can't only two of us go.  I can hold out here longer than you
could, an' you can go just as far with the horses as I could.  Just give
them their head an' let them drift--that's all I could do.  If the storm
lets up you'll see the Split Rock water-hole--you can't miss it if you're
in sight of it, there's a long black ridge with a big busted rock on the
end of it, an' just off the end is a round, high mound--the soda hill,
they call it, and the water-hole is between.  If you pass the water-hole,
you'll strike the Miszoo.  You can tell that from a long ways off, too,
by the fringe of green that lines the banks.  And, as for the rest of
it--I mean, if the storm don't let up, or the horses go down, I couldn't
do any more than you could--it's cashin' in time then anyhow, an' the
long, long sleep, no matter who's runnin' the outfit.  An' if it comes to
that, it's better for her to pass her last hours with one of her own kind
than with--me."

Endicott thrust out his hand: "I think any one could be proud to spend
their last hours with one of your kind," he said huskily.  "I believe we
will all win through--but, if worse comes to worst----  Good Bye."

"So Long, Win," said the cowboy, grasping the hand.  "Wake her up an'
pull out quick.  I'll onhobble the horses."


CHAPTER XVIII

"WIN"

Alice opened her eyes to see Endicott bending over her.  "It is time to
pull out," said the man tersely.

The girl threw off the blanket and stared into the whirl of opaque
dust.  "The storm is still raging," she murmured.  "Oh, Winthrop, do
you know that I dreamed it was all over--that we were riding between
high, cool mountains beside a flashing stream.  And trout were leaping
in the rapids, and I got off and drank and drank of the clear, cold
water, and, why, do you know, I feel actually refreshed!  The horrible
burning thirst has gone.  That proves the control mind has over
matter--if we could just concentrate and think hard enough, I don't
believe we would ever need to be thirsty, or hungry, or tired, or cold,
do you?"

The man smiled grimly, and shook his head: "No.  If we could think hard
_enough_ to accomplish a thing, why, manifestly that thing would be
accomplished.  Great word--enough--the trouble is, when you use it, you
never say anything."

Alice laughed: "You're making fun of me.  I don't care, you know what I
mean, anyway.  Why, what's the matter with that horse?"

"He died--got weaker and weaker, and at last he just rolled over dead.
And that is why we have to hurry and make a try for the water-hole,
before the others play out."

Endicott noticed that the Texan was nowhere in sight.  He pressed his
lips firmly: "It's better that way, I guess," he thought.

"But, that's your horse!  And where are the others--Tex, and Bat, and
the pack-horse?"

"They pulled out to hunt for the water-hole--each in a different
direction.  You and I are to keep together and drift with the wind as
we have been doing."

"And they gave us the best of it," she breathed.  Endicott winced, and
the girl noticed.  She laid her hand gently upon his arm.  "No,
Winthrop, I didn't mean that.  There was a time, perhaps, when I might
have thought--but, that was before I knew you.  I have learned a lot in
the past few days, Winthrop--enough to know that no matter what
happens, you have played a man's part--with the rest of them.  Come,
I'm ready."

Endicott tied the scarf about her face and assisted her to mount, then,
throwing her bridle reins over the horn of his saddle as the Texan had
done, he headed down the coulee.  For three hours the horses drifted
with the storm, following along coulees, crossing low ridges, and long
level stretches where the sweep of the wind seemed at times as though
it would tear them from the saddles.  Endicott's horse stumbled
frequently, and each time the recovery seemed more and more of an
effort.  Then suddenly the wind died--ceased to blow as abruptly as it
had started.  The man could scarcely believe his senses as he listened
in vain for the roar of it--the steady, sullen roar, that had rung in
his ears, it seemed, since the beginning of time.  Thick dust filled
the air but when he turned his face toward the west no sand particles
stung his skin.  Through a rift he caught sight of a low butte--a butte
that was not nearby.  Alice tore the scarf from her face.  "It has
stopped!" she cried, excitedly.  "The storm is over!"

"Thank God!" breathed Endicott, "the dust is beginning to settle."  He
dismounted and swung the girl to the ground.  "We may as well wait here
as anywhere until the air clears sufficiently for us to get our
bearings.  We certainly must have passed the water-hole, and we would
only be going farther and farther away if we pushed on."

The dust settled rapidly.  Splashes of sunshine showed here and there
upon the basin and ridge, and it grew lighter.  The atmosphere took on
the appearance of a thin grey fog that momentarily grew thinner.
Endicott walked to the top of a low mound and gazed eagerly about him.
Distant objects were beginning to appear--bare rock-ridges, and
low-lying hills, and deep coulees.  In vain the man's eyes followed the
ridges for one that terminated in a huge broken rock, with its nearby
soda hill.  No such ridge appeared, and no high, round hill.  Suddenly
his gaze became rivetted upon the southern horizon.  What was that
stretching away, long, and dark, and winding?  Surely--surely it
was--trees!  Again and again he tried to focus his gaze upon that long
dark line, but always his lids drew over his stinging eyeballs, and
with a half-sobbed curse, he dashed the water from his eyes.  At last
he saw it--the green of distant timber.  "The Missouri--five
miles--maybe more.  Oh God, if the horses hold out!"  Running,
stumbling, he made his way to the girl's side.  "It's the river!" he
cried.  "The Missouri!"

"Look at the horses!" Indeed, his eager love of battle, and splendid
disregard of peril, have made many writers forget his really great
qualities as a general.
Soldiers are always prompt to recognize the prime virtue of physical
courage, and Wayne's followers christened their daring commander "Mad
Anthony," in loving allusion to his reckless bravery.

It is perfectly true that Wayne had this courage, and that he was a born
fighter; otherwise, he never would have been a great commander. A man
who lacks the fondness for fighting, the eager desire to punish
his adversary, and the willingness to suffer punishment in return,
may be a great organizer, like McClellan, but can never become a
great general or win great victories.

There are, however, plenty of men who, though they possess these
fine manly traits, yet lack the head to command an army; but Wayne
had not only the heart and the hand but the head likewise.
No man could dare as greatly as he did without incurring the risk
of an occasional check; but he was an able and bold tactician, a
vigilant and cautious leader, well fitted to bear the terrible
burden of responsibility which rests upon a commander-in-chief.

Of course, at times he had some rather severe lessons. Quite early
in his career, just after the battle of the Brandywine, when he was set
to watch the enemy, he was surprised at night by the British general
Grey, a redoubtable fighter, who attacked him with the bayonet, killed
a number of his men, and forced him to fall back some distance
from the field of action.

This mortifying experience had no effect whatever on Wayne's courage
or self-reliance, but it did give him a valuable lesson in caution.
He showed what he had learned by the skill with which, many years later,
he conducted the famous campaign in which he overthrew the
Northwestern Indians at the Fight of the Fallen Timbers.

Wayne's favorite weapon was the bayonet, and, like Scott he taught
his troops, until they were able in the shock of hand-to-hand
conflict to overthrow the renowned British infantry, who have always
justly prided themselves on their prowess with cold steel.

At the battle of Germantown it was Wayne's troops who, falling on with
the bayonet, drove the Hessians and the British light infantry, and
only retreated under orders when the attack had failed elsewhere. At
Monmouth it was Wayne and his Continentals who first checked the British
advance by repulsing the bayonet charge of the guards and
grenadiers.

Washington, a true leader of men, was prompt to recognize in Wayne a
soldier to whom could be intrusted any especially difficult enterprise
which called for the exercise alike of intelligence and of cool daring.

In the summer of 1780 he was very anxious to capture the British fort
at Stony Point, which commanded the Hudson.

It was impracticable to attack it by regular siege while the British
frigates lay in the river, and the defenses ere so strong that
open assault by daylight was equally out of the question.

Accordingly Washington suggested to Wayne that he try a night attack.
Wayne eagerly caught at the idea. It was exactly the kind of enterprise
in which he delighted. The fort was on a rocky promontory, surrounded
on three sides by water, and on the fourth by a neck of land, which
was for the most part mere morass. It was across this neck of land that
any attacking column had to move. The garrison was six hundred strong.
To deliver the assault Wayne took nine hundred men. The American army
was camped about fourteen miles from Stony Point.

One July afternoon Wayne started, and led his troops in single file along
the narrow rocky roads, reaching the hills on the mainland near
the fort after nightfall.

He divided his force into two columns, to advance one along each
side of the neck, detaching two companies of North Carolina troops
to move in between the two columns and make a false attack.

The rest of the force consisted of New Englanders, Pennsylvanians,
and Virginians.

Each attacking column was divided into three parts, a forlorn hope of
twenty men leading, which was followed by an advance guard of one
hundred and twenty, and then by the main body.

At the time commanding officers still carried spontoons, and other old-time
weapons, and Wayne, who himself led the right column, directed its
movements spear in hand.

It was nearly midnight when the Americans began to press along the
causeways toward the fort. Before they were near the walls they were
discovered, and the British opened a heavy fire of great guns and
musketry, to which the Carolinians, who were advancing between the
two columns, responded in their turn, according to orders; but the men
in the columns were forbidden to fire. Wayne had warned them
that their work must be done with the bayonet, and their muskets were
not even loaded.
The man regarded him with slow insolence: "The hell ye hev," he
drawled; "Timber City's only seven mile, ef ye was acrost the river.  I
hain't runnin' no hotel, an' grub-liners hain't welcome."

"God, man!  You don't mean----"

"I mean, ef ye got five dollars on ye I'll ferry ye acrost to where ye
c'n ride to Timber City ef them old skates'll carry ye there, an' ef ye
hain't got the five, ye c'n swim acrost, or shove on up the river, or
go back where ye come from."

Endicott took one swift step forward, his right fist shot into the
man's stomach, and as he doubled forward with a grunt of pain,
Endicott's left crashed against the point of his jaw with a force that
sent him spinning like a top as he crumpled to the hard-trodden earth
of the door-yard.

"Good!" cried Alice.  "It was beautifully done.  He didn't even have a
chance to shoot," she pointed to the two 45's that hung, one at either
hip.

"I guess we'll just relieve him of those," said Endicott, and, jerking
the revolvers from their holsters, walked to his saddle and uncoiled
the rope.  Alice lent eager assistance, and a few moments later the
inhospitable one lay trussed hand and foot.  "Now, we'll go in and find
something to eat," said Endicott, as he made fast the final hitch.

The cabin was well stocked with provisions and, to the surprise of the
two, was reasonably clean.  While Alice busied herself in the cabin,
Endicott unsaddled the horses and turned them into a small field where
the vegetation grew rank and high and green beside a series of
irrigation ditches.  Passing the horse corral he saw that three or four
saddle-horses dozed in the shade of its pole fence, and continued on to
the river bank where he inspected minutely the ferry.

"I guess we can manage to cross the river," he told Alice, when he
returned to the cabin; "I will breathe easier when I see you safe in
Timber City, wherever that is.  I am coming back after Tex.  But first
I must see you safe."

The girl crossed to his side and as the man glanced into her face he
saw that her eyes were shining with a new light--a light he had dreamed
could shine from those eyes, but never dared hope to see.  "No, Win,"
she answered softly, and despite the mighty pounding of his heart the
man realized it was the first time she had used that name.  "You are
not going back alone.  I am going too."  Endicott made a gesture of
protest but she gave no heed.  "From now on my place is with you.  Oh,
Win, can't you see!  I--I guess I have always loved you--only I didn't
know It.  I wanted romance--wanted a red-blood man--a man who could do
things, and----"

"Oh, if I could come to you clean-handed!" he interrupted,
passionately; "if I could offer you a hand unstained by the blood of a
fellow creature!"

She laid a hand gently upon his shoulder and looked straight into his
eyes: "Don't, Win," she said; "don't always hark back to _that_.  Let
us forget."

"I wish to God I could forget!" he answered, bitterly.  "I know the act
was justified.  I believe it was unavoidable.  But--it is my New
England conscience, I suppose."

Alice smiled: "Don't let your conscience bother you, because it is a
New England conscience.  They call you 'the pilgrim' out here.  It is
the name they called your early Massachusetts forebears--and if history
is to be credited, they never allowed their consciences to stand in the
way of taking human life."

"But, they thought they were right."

"And you _know_ you were right!"

"I know--I know!  It isn't the ethics--only the fact."

"Don't brood over it.  Don't think of it, dear.  Or, if you must, think
of it only as a grim duty performed--a duty that proved, as nothing
else could have proved, that you are every inch a man."

Endicott drew her close against his pounding heart.  "It proved that
the waters of the Erie Canal, if given the chance, can dash as madly
unrestrained as can the waters of the Grand Canyon."

She pressed her fingers to his lips: "Don't make fun of me.  I was a
fool."

"I'm not making fun--I didn't know it myself, until--" the sentence was
drowned in a series of yells and curses and vile epithets that brought
both to the door to stare down at the trussed-up one who writhed on the
ground in a very paroxysm of rage.

"Conscience hurting you, or is it your jaw?" asked Endicott, as he
grinned into the rage-distorted features.

"Git them hosses outa that alfalfy!  You ---- ---- ---- ---- ----!
I'll hev th' law on ye!  I'll shoot ye!  I'll drag yer guts out!"  So
great was the man's fury that a thin white foam flecked his
hate-distorted lips, and his voice rose to a high-pitched whine.
Endicott glanced toward the two horses that stood, belly-deep, in the
lush vegetation.

"They like it," he said, calmly.  "It's the first feed they have had in
two days."  The man's little pig eyes glared red, and his voice choked
in an inarticulate snarl.

Alice turned away in disgust.  "Let him alone," she said, "and we will
have dinner.  I'm simply famished.  Nothing ever looked so good to me
in the world as that ham and potatoes and corn and peas."  During the
course of the meal, Endicott tried to dissuade the girl from her
purpose of accompanying him on his search for Tex and the half-breed.
But she would have it no other way, and finally, perforce, he consented.

Leaving her to pack up some food, Endicott filled the water-bag that
hung on the wall and, proceeding to the corral, saddled three of the
horses.  Through the open window of the cabin he could see the girl
busily engaged in transferring provisions to a sack.  He watched her as
she passed and repassed the window intent upon her task.  Never had she
seemed so lovable, so unutterably desirable--and she loved him!  With
her own lips she had told him of her love, and with her own lips had
placed the seal of love upon his own.  Happiness, like no happiness he
had ever known should be his.  And yet--hovering over him like a
pall--black, ominous, depressing--was the thing that momentarily
threatened to descend and engulf him, to destroy this new-found
happiness, haunt him with its diabolical presence, and crush his
life--and hers.

With an effort he roused himself--squared himself there in the corral
for the final battle with himself.  "It is now or never," he gritted
through clenched teeth.  "Now, and alone.  She won't face the situation
squarely.  It is woman's way, calmy to ignore the issue, to push it
aside as the ill of a future day."

She had said that he was right, and ethically, he knew that he was
right--but the fact of the deed remained.  His hand had sped a soul to
its God.

Why?

To save the woman he loved.  No jury on earth would hold him guilty.
He would surrender himself and stand trial.  Then came the memory of
what Tex had told him of the machinations of local politics.  He had no
wish to contribute his life as campaign material for a county election.
The other course was to run--to remain, as he now was, a fugitive, if
not from justice, at least from the hand of the law.  This course would
mean that both must live always within the menace of the
shadow--unless, to save her from this life of haunting fear, he
renounced her.

His eyes sought the forbidding sweep of the bad lands, strayed to the
sluggish waters of the Missouri, and beyond, where the black buttes of
the Judith Range reared their massive shapes in the distance.  Suddenly
a mighty urge welled up within him.  He would not renounce her!  She
was his!  This was life--the life that, to him, had been as a sealed
book--the fighting life of the boundless open places.  It was the
coward's part to run.  He had played a man's part, and he would
continue to play a man's part to the end.  He would fight.  Would
identify himself with this West--become part of it.  Never would he
return to the life of the city, which would be to a life of fear.  The
world should know that he was right.  If local politics sought to crush
him--to use him as a puppet for their puny machinations, he would smash
their crude machine and rebuild the politics of this new land upon
principles as clean and rugged as the land itself.  It should be his
work!

With the light of a new determination in his eyes, he caught up the
bridle-reins of the horses and pushed open the gate of the corral.  As
he led the animals out he was once more greeted with a volley of oaths
and curses: "Put them back!  Ye hoss-thief!  I'll have ye hung!  Them's
mine, I tell ye!"

"You'll get them back," assured Endicott.  "I am only borrowing them to
go and hunt for a couple of friends of mine back there in the bad
lands."

"Back in the bad lands!  What do ye know about the bad lands?  Ye'll
git lost, an' then what'll happen to me?  I'll die like a coyote in a
trap!  I'll starve here where no one comes along fer it's sometimes a
week--mebbe two!"

"It will be a long time between meals if anything should happen to us,
but it will do you good to lie here and think it over.  We'll be back
sometime."  Endicott made the sack of provisions fast to the saddle of
the lead-horse, and assisted Alice to mount.

"I'll kill ye fer this!" wailed the man; "I'll--I'll--" but the two
rode away with the futile threats ringing in their ears.


CHAPTER XIX

THE END OF THE TRAIL

"How are we going to find them?" asked the girl, as the two drew their
mounts to a stand on the top of a low ridge and gazed out over the sea
of similar ridges that rolled and spread before them as far as the eye
could reach in three directions--bare coulees, and barer ridges, with
here and there a low bare hill, all black and red and grey, with
studdings of mica flashing in the rays of the afternoon sun.

"We'll find them.  We've got to.  I have just been thinking: Living on
the edge of the bad lands the way this man does he must occasionally
cross them.  Tex said that the Split Rock water-hole was the only one
between the river and the mountains.  We'll start the horses out and
give them their heads, and the chances are they will take us to the
water-hole.  In all probability Tex and Bat will be there.  If they are
not we will have to find them."

"Of course!" assented the girl.  "Oh, Win, I'm so proud of you!  I
couldn't be any prouder if you were a--a real cowboy!"  Endicott
laughed heartily, and urged his horse forward.  The animals crossed
several low ridges and struck into a coulee which they followed
unhesitatingly.  When it petered out in a wide basin, they struck into
another coulee, and continued their course, covering the miles at a
long, swinging trot.  At sundown Endicott reined in sharply and pointed
to the northward.  "It's the ridge of the Split Rock!" he cried; "and
look, there is the soda hill!"  There it was only a mile or two
away--the long black ridge with the huge rock fragment at its end, and
almost touching it, the high round hill that the Texan had described.

The horses pressed eagerly forward, seeming to know that rest and water
were soon to be theirs.  "I wonder if they are there," breathed the
girl, "and I wonder if they are--all right."

A few minutes later the horses swung around the base of the hill and,
with an exclamation of relief, Endicott saw two figures seated beside
the detached fragment of rock that lay near the end of the ridge.

The Texan arose slowly and advanced toward them, smiling: "Good
evenin'," he greeted, casually, as he eyed the pair with evident
approval.  "You sure come a-runnin'.  We didn't expect you 'til along
about noon tomorrow.  And we didn't expect you at all," he said to the
girl.  "We figured you'd shove on to Timber City, an' then Win would
get a guide an' come back in the mornin'."

Endicott laughed: "When I learned there was such a place as Timber
City, I intended to leave her there and return alone--only I was not
going to wait 'til morning to do it.  But she wouldn't hear of it, so
we compromised--and she came with me."

Tex smiled: "It's a great thing to learn how to compromise."  He stared
for a few moments toward the west, where the setting sun left the sky
ablaze with fiery light.  Then, still smiling, he advanced toward them
with both hands extended: "I wish you luck," he said, softly.  "I cared
for you a mighty lot, Miss Alice, but I'm a good loser.  I reckon,
maybe it's better things worked out the way they did."  Endicott
pressed the outstretched hand with a mighty grip and turned swiftly
away to fumble at his latigo strap.  And there were tears in the girl's
eyes as her fingers lingered for a moment in the Texan's grasp: "Oh,
I--I'm sorry.  I----"

"You don't need to be," the man whispered.  "You chose the best of the
two."  He indicated Endicott with a slight jerk of the head.  "You've
got a real man there--an' they're oncommon hard to find.  An' now, if
you've got some grub along suppose we tie into it.  I'm hungry enough
to gnaw horn!"

As Alice proceeded to set out the food, the Texan's eyes for the first
time strayed to the horses.  "How much did Long Bill Kearney soak you
for the loan of his saddle-horses?"

"Nothing," answered Endicott, "and he supplied us with the grub, too."

"He, what?"

"Fact," smiled the other, "he demurred a little, but----"

"Long Bill's the hardest character in Choteau County."

Endicott glanced at his swollen knuckles: "He is hard, all right."

Tex eyed him in amazement, "Win, you didn't--punch his head for him!"

"I did--and his stomach, too.

AUTHORS AND EDITORS.

"Do you hear, let them be well used." SHAKSPEARE.

Accustomed as our readers are to the quips, quirks, and quibbles, of the
_Gatherer_, we doubt whether the following loose reflections will
not be received as egotistical, or out of place.

But we are induced to the hazard by the recent appearance of "The Tale
of a Modern Genius," (stated to be by Mr.

Pennie,) and an interesting paper in the last _London Magazine_, entitled
"Memoirs of a Young Peasant:" in which productions the fates and
fortunes of genius are set forth with very powerful claims to the
sympathy of readers.

Indeed, we recommend their perusal to many of our "neglected" correspondents,
in the hope of their becoming more reconciled to the justice with
which their contributions are rejected.

In the comparison, their works will be as "the labours of idleness,"
listlessly penned under first impressions, or, at best, with the fond
anticipation of appearing in print. Vexatious as the disappointment
may appear, what is it compared with the bare fate of genius, stripped
of the bare means of sustenance by the unsuccessful result of a literary
engagement, or the non-completion of a purchase, on which probably
depended the very day's existence.

The subject is trite and hacknied; but all that has been written about
the illusions and misgivings of genius will not alter its complexion.

It is true that such details have raised a spirit of sympathetic forbearance
towards the distresses of men of letters, except in the breasts
of the most barbarous and vulgar. But their sufferings are doubly acute,
and their perceptions doubly tender. In their intercourse with mankind,
they become _flattered_ by associates, and it not unfrequently happens
that men who are the most ready to quote such ascendancy or superiority
in society, are the first to break the charm they have created, by
some act of extreme rigour. Such conduct is cruel and unchristian.

Again, the sufferings of men of genius are increased by their own
reflection on them, and in addition to real woes they thus inflict
on themselves thousands of imaginary ones.

Every time he'd get three cards of a suit in a row, he'd draw
to 'em, hopin' for a straight flush.  That hope cost him, I reckon,
hundreds of dollars, an' at last he filled one--but, hell!  Everyone
laid down, an' he gathered the ante."  The Texan rolled another
cigarette.  "An' that's the way it is with me--I tried to force my
luck.  I might as well own up to it right here an' get it over with.
You've be'n square, straight through, an' I haven't.  I was stringin'
you with all that bunk about politics, an' you bein' sure to get hung
for shootin' Purdy.  Fact is, the grand jury would have turned you
loose as soon as your case come up.  But, from the first minute I laid
eyes on that girl, I wanted her.  I'm bad enough, but not like Purdy.
I figured if she'd go half-way, I'd go the other half.  So I planned
the raid on the wool-warehouse, an' the fake lynchin', purpose to get
her out of town.  I didn't care a damn about you--you was just an
excuse to get her away.  I figured on losing you after we hit the
mountains.  The first jolt I got was in the warehouse, when we didn't
have to drag you out.  Then I got another hell of a one in the coulee
under the cottonwoods.  Then they got to comin' so thick I lost track
of 'em.  An' the first thing I knew I would have killed any man that
would look crossways at _her_.  It come over me all of a sudden that I
loved her.  I tried to get out of it, but I was hooked.  I watched
close, an' I saw that she liked me--maybe not altogether for what she
thought I'd done for you.  But you was in the road.  I knew she liked
you, too, though she wouldn't show it.  'Everything's fair in love or
war,' I kept sayin' over an' over to myself when I'd lay thinkin' it
over of nights.  But, I knew it was a damned lie when I was sayin' it.
If you'd be'n milk-gutted, an' louse-hearted, like pilgrims are
supposed to be, there'd be'n a different story to tell, because you
wouldn't have be'n fit for her.  But I liked you most as hard as I
loved her.  'From now on it's a square game,' I says, so I made Old Man
Johnson cough up that outfit of raiment, an' made you shave, so she
wouldn't have to take you lookin' like a sheep-herdin' greaser, if she
was a-goin' to take you instead of me.  After that I come right out an'
told her just where I stood, an' from then on I've played the game
square.  The women ain't divided up right in this world.  There ought
to have be'n two of her, but they ain't another in the whole world, I
reckon, like her; so one of us had to lose.  An', now, seein' how I've
lied you into all this misery, you ought to just naturally up an' knock
hell out of me.  We'll still keep the game fair an' square.  I'll throw
away my gun an' you can sail in as quick as you get your sleeves rolled
up.  But, I doubt if you can get away with it, at that."

Endicott laughed happily, and in the darkness his hand stole across and
gripped the hand of the Texan in a mighty grip: "I wish to God there
was some way I could thank you," he said.  "Had it not been for you, I
never could have won her.  Why, man, I never got acquainted with myself
until the past three days!"

"There ain't any posses out," grinned Tex.  "The fellow I met in the
coulee there by Antelope Butte told me.  They think you were lynched.
He told me somethin' else, too--but that'll keep."

As they were saddling up, the following morning, the Texan grinned:
"I'll bet old Long Bill Kearney's in a pleasin' frame of mind."

"He's had time to meditate a little on his sins," answered Alice.

"No--not Long Bill ain't.  If he started in meditatin' on them, he'd
starve to death before he'd got meditated much past sixteen--an' he's
fifty, if he's a day."

"There are four of us and only three horses," exclaimed Endicott, as he
tightened his cinch.

"That's all right.  The horses are fresh.  I'm light built, an' we'll
change off makin' 'em carry double.  It ain't so far."

The morning sun was high when the horses turned into the coulee that
led to Long Bill's ranch.  Bat, who had scouted ahead to make sure that
he had not succeeded in slipping his bonds and had plotted mischief,
sat grinning beside the corral fence as he listened, unobserved, to the
whimpering and wailing of the man who lay bound beside the cabin door.

"What's the matter, Willie?" smiled Tex, as he slipped from his seat
behind Endicott's saddle.  "Didn't your breakfast set right?"

The man rolled to face them at the sound of the voice, and such a
stream of obscene blasphemy poured from his lips as to cause even the
Texan to wince.  Without a word the cowboy reached for a bar of soap
that lay awash in the filthy water of a basin upon a bench beside the
door, and jammed it down the man's throat.  The sounds changed to a
sputtering, choking gurgle.  "Maybe that'll learn you not to talk vile
when there's ladies around."

"Water!" the man managed to gasp.

"Will you quit your damn swearin'?"

Long Bill nodded, and Tex held a dipper to his lips.

"Go catch up the horses, Bat, an' we'll be gettin' out of here.  They's
some reptiles so mean that even their breath is poison."

As Bat started for the alfalfa field the man fairly writhed with fury:
"I'll hev the law on ye, ye--" he stopped abruptly as Tex reached for
the soap.

"You won't have the law on no one, you lizard!  You don't dare to get
within hollerin' distance of the law."

"I will pay you a reasonable amount for any damage to your field, and
for the food, and the use of your horses," offered Endicott, reaching
for his pocket.

"Keep your money, Win," grinned the Texan.  "Let me pay for this.  This
coyote owes me twenty dollars he borrowed from me when I first hit the
country an' didn't know him.  He's always be'n anxious to pay it, ain't
you, Bill?  Well, it's paid now, an' you don't need to go worryin' your
heart out about that debt no longer."

Again the man opened his lips, but closed them hurriedly as Tex reached
for the soap.

"I'll have to borrow your horse an' saddle for my friend, here," said
the Texan, "an' Bat, he'll have to borrow one, too.  We'll leave 'em in
Timber City."

"_Non_!" cried the half-breed, who had paused in the process of
changing Alice's saddle to her own horse.  "Me--I ain' gon' for bor' no
hoss.  Am tak' dis hoss an' giv' heem back to Judge Carson.  Him b'long
over on Sage Creek."

"Whad'ye mean, ye red scum!" screamed the man, his face growing purple.
"That Circle 12 brand is----"

"Ha!  Circle 12!  De mos' dat Circle 12 she hair-bran'."  He stepped
into the cabin and reappeared a moment later with some coal-oil in a
cup.  This he poured into his hand and rubbed over the brand on the
horse's shoulder.  And when he had pressed the hair flat, the Circle 12
resolved itself into a V 2.

The Texan laughed: "I suppose I ought to take you into Timber City, but
I won't.  I imagine, though, when the Judge hears about this, you'd
better be hittin' the high spots.  He's right ugly with horse thieves."

"Hey, hain't ye goin' to ontie me?" squealed the man, as the four
started down the bank with the horses.

"You don't suppose I'd go off an' leave a good rope where you could get
your claws on it, do you?  Wait 'til we get these horses onto the
flat-boat, and all the guns around here collected so you can't peck at
us from the brush, an' I'll be back."

"You gon' on to Timbaire City," said Bat, "an' I'm com' long bye-m-bye.
A'm tak' dis hoss an' ride back an' git ma saddle an' bridle."  He
advanced and removed his hat; "_Adieu, ma'mselle_, mebbe-so I ain' git
dere 'til you gon'.  Ol' Bat, he lak' you fine.  You need de help,
som'tam', you mak' de write to ol' Bat an', ba Goss, A'm com' lak'
hell--you bet you dam' life!"  Tears blinded the girl's eyes as she
held out her hand, and as a cavalier of old France, the half-breed bent
and brushed it with his lips.  He shook the hand of Endicott: "Som'tam'
mebbe-so you com' back, we tak' de hont.  Me--A'm know where de elk an'
de bear liv' plenty."  Endicott detected a twinkle in his eye as he
turned to ascend the bank: "You mak' Tex ke'p de strong lookout for de
posse.  A'm no lak' I seen you git hang."

"Beat it!  You old reprobate!" called the Texan as he followed him up
the slope.

"How'm I goin' to git my boat back?" whined Long Bill, as the Texan
coiled his rope.

"Swim acrost.  Or, maybe you'd better go 'round--it's some little
further that way, but it's safer if you can't swim.  I'll leave your
guns in the boat.  So long, an' be sure to remember not to furget
sometime an' pay me back that twenty."

The ride to Timber City was made almost in silence.  Only once did the
Texan speak.  It was when they passed a band of sheep grazing beside
the road: "They're minin' the country," he said, thoughtfully.  "The
time ain't far off when we'll have to turn nester--or move on."

"Where?" asked Alice.

The cowboy shrugged, and the girl detected a note of unconscious
sadness in his tone: "I don't know.  I reckon there ain't any place for
me.  The whole country's about wired in."

Timber City, since abandoned to the bats and the coyotes, but then in
her glory, consisted of two stores, five saloons, a half-dozen less
reputable places of entertainment, a steepleless board church, a
schoolhouse, also of boards, a hotel, a post office, a feed stable,
fifty or more board shacks of miners, and a few flimsy buildings at the
mouths of shafts.  It was nearly noon when the three drew up before the
hotel.

"Will you dine with us in an hour?" asked Endicott.

The Texan nodded.  "Thanks," he said, formally, "I'll be here."  And as
the two disappeared through the door, he gathered up the reins, crossed
to the feed barn where he turned the animals over to the proprietor,
and passing on to the rear, proceeded to take a bath in the watering
trough.

Punctually on the minute he entered the hotel.  The meal was a solemn
affair, almost as silent as the ride from the river.  Several attempts
at conversation fell flat, and the effort was abandoned.  At no time,
however, did the Texan appear embarrassed, and Alice noted that he
handled his knife and fork with the ease of early training.

At the conclusion he arose, abruptly: "I thank you.  Will you excuse
me, now?"

Alice nodded, and both watched as he crossed the room, his spurs
trailing noisily upon the wooden floor.

"Poor devil," said Endicott, "this has hit him pretty hard."

The girl swallowed the rising lump in her throat: "Oh, why can't he
meet some nice girl, and----"

"Women--his kind--are mighty scarce out here, I imagine."

The girl placed her elbows upon the table, rested her chin upon her
knuckles, and glanced eagerly into Endicott's face:

"Win, you've just got to buy a ranch," she announced, the words fairly
tumbling over each other in her excitement.  "Then we can come out here
part of the time and live, and we can invite a lot of girls out for the
summer--I just know oodles of nice girls--and Tex can manage the ranch,
and----"

"Match-making already!" laughed Endicott.  "Why buy a ranch?  Why not
move into Wolf River, or Timber City, and start a regular matrimonial
agency--satisfaction guaranteed, or your money back.  It would be more
prac----"

"Winthrop Adams Endicott!"

"Oh, I forgot!  I'm not practical.  I'm romantic, and red-blooded,
and--" they had the little dining-room to themselves; he rose swiftly
from his chair and, crossing to her side, stooped and kissed her, not
once, but twice, and thrice,--"I'm glad of it!  And that reminds me, I
have a couple of errands to attend to, so you will have to manage to
worry along without me for fifteen minutes or so."

She laughed up into his face: "How can I ever stand it?  I've worried
along without you all my life.  I guess I'll survive."

"You won't have to much longer," he smiled, and hastened from the room.
A half-hour later he returned to find her waiting in the hotel
"parlour."  She saw that his eyes were shining as he crossed eagerly,
seated himself upon the haircloth sofa beside her, and whispered in her
ear.

"Winthrop!  Indeed we won't do anything of the kind!  Why
it's--it's----"

"It's impractical, and it's romantic," he finished for her.  "Also,
it's unconventional.  Now, refuse if you dare!  The stage leaves for
Lewiston and the railroad at five.  He seems to be a regular chap--the
parson.  Both he and his wife insisted that the event take place in
their house.  Said it would be much pleasanter than the hotel--and I
heartily agreed with them.  We figured that half-past four would give
us just about time."

"Well, of all things!" blushed the girl.  "You two arranged the whole
affair, and of course, as I'm only the bride, it wasn't necessary to
consult me at all!"

"Exactly," smiled Endicott; "I'm red-blooded, you know, and
romantic--and when I go in for little things like unconventionality,
and romance, I go the limit.  And you don't dare refuse!"

She looked up into his eyes, shining with boyish enthusiasm: "I don't
dare," she whispered.  "I don't want to dare.  Oh, Win, I--I'm just
crazy about it!"

A few moments later she drew away from him and smoothed her hair.

"You must go right this minute and find Tex.  And, oh, I hope Bat will
be here in time!  I just love old Bat!"  She ceased speaking and looked
questioningly into his eyes which had suddenly become grave.

He breaks off some branches. Cave opens again on the river bank, and he
finds his dog and the dead deer at the entrance.

He sees that fruits on the branches he carries are agate beads.
Returns, but fails to find more.

His townspeople go with him to seek the wonderful tree, but part
of the cave is closed by the spirit Kaboniyan who owns it.

The jar Magsawi formerly talked softly, but now is cracked and
cannot be understood.

In the first times the dogs of some hunters chased the jar and the men
followed, thinking it to be a deer. The jar eluded them until a voice
from the sky informed the pursuers how it might be caught. The blood of
a pig was offered, as the voice directed, and the jar was captured.

73
The sun and moon fight. Sun throws sand in moon's face and makes the
dark spots which are still visible.

A man who went with a war party is away so long that he does not
recognize his daughter when he returns. He embraces her when she
meets him at the town gate. In shame she changes herself into a
coconut tree.

Two flying snakes once guarded the gap in the mountains by which
the Abra river reaches the sea.

Two brave men attack them with banana trunks. Their wings stick in
the banana trees and they are easily killed.

The men are rewarded with gold made in the shape of deer and
horses.

76
A man named Tagápen, of Ilocos Norte, with his wife and child goes
up the Abra river on a raft.

They stop at various towns and Tagápen goes up to each while his wife
comforts the child. They finally reached Patok where they go to
live in the balaua.

They remain there teaching the people many songs.

A turtle and a monkey go to plant bananas. The turtle places his in the
ground, but the monkey hangs his in a tree. Soon the tree of the turtle
has ripe fruit, but the monkey has none. Turtle asks monkey to climb
and secure the fruit. Monkey eats all but one banana, then sleeps in the
tree. Turtle plants sharp shells around the tree and then frightens
monkey which falls and is killed. Turtle sells his flesh to other
monkey and then chides them because they eat their kind. Monkeys catch
turtle and threaten first to cut and then to burn him. He deceives
them by showing them marks on his body. They tie weight to him and
throw him into the water. He reappears with a fish. Monkeys try
to imitate him and are drowned.

A turtle and lizard go to steal ginger. The lizard talks so loudly he
attracts the attention of the owner. The turtle hides, but the
lizard runs and is pursued by the man. The turtle enters the house
and hides under a coconut shell. When the man sits on the shell the
turtle calls. He cannot discover source of noise and thinks it comes
from his testicles. He strikes these with a stone and dies. The
turtle and the lizard see a bees' nest. The lizard hastens to get
it and is stung. They see a bird snare and turtle claims it as the
necklace of his father. Lizard runs to get it but is caught and
killed.

79
A little bird calls many times for a boy to catch it. He snares it
and places it in a jar. Lad's grandmother eats the bird. He discovers
the theft, leaves home and gets a big stone to swallow him. The
grandmother gets horses to kick the stone, carabao to hook it, and
chickens to peck it, but without result.The shadow of a smile flickered on the Texan's lips: "After a while,
maybe--but not soon.  I've got to lick a savage, first--and they die
hard."

Endicott turned to go, when the other called to him: "Oh, Win!"  He
turned.  "Is she here--anywhere around?  I must tell her good-bye."

"Yes, she is down the creek a way.  I'll send her to you."

The Texan advanced to meet her, Stetson in hand: "Good-bye," he said,
"an' good luck.  I can't give you no regular weddin' present--there's
nothin' in the town that's fit.  But, I'll give you this--I'll give you
your man clean-handed.  He ain't wanted.  There's no one wants him--but
you.  He didn't kill Purdy that night.  It's too bad he didn't--but he
didn't.  We all thought he did, but he only creased him.  He came to,
after we'd pulled out.  I heard it from the puncher I had the fight
with in the coulee--an' it's straight goods."  He paused abruptly, and
the girl stared wide-eyed into his face.  The wild flowers dropped from
her hands, and she laid trembling fingers upon his arm.

"What are you saying?" she cried, fiercely.  "That Purdy is not dead?
That Win didn't kill him?  That----"

"No.  Win didn't kill him," interrupted the Texan, with a smile.

"Have you told Win?"

"No.  Weddin' presents are for the bride.  I saved it for you."

Tears were streaming from the girl's eyes: "It's the most wonderful
wedding present anybody ever had," she sobbed.  "I know Win did it for
me, and if he had killed him it would have been justifiable--right.
But, always, we would have had that thing to think of.  It would have
been like some hideous nightmare.  We could have put it away, but it
would have come again--always.  I pretended I didn't care.  I wouldn't
let him see that it was worrying me, even more than it worried him."

The cowboy stooped and recovered the flowers from the ground.  As Alice
took them from him, her hand met his: "Good-bye," she faltered,
"and--may God bless you!"

At the rock she turned and saw him still standing, hat in hand, as she
had left him.  Then she passed around the rock, and down the creek,
where her lover waited with his arms laden with blossoms.


AN EPILOGUE

At exactly half-past four the Texan galloped to the door of the Red
Front Saloon, and swinging from his horse, entered.  Some men were
playing cards at a table in the rear, but he paid them no heed.  Very
deliberately he squared himself to the bar and placed his foot upon the
brass rail: "Give me some red liquor," he ordered.  And when the
bartender set out the bottle and the glass the cowboy poured it full
and drank it at a gulp.  He poured out another, and then a third, and a
fourth.  The bartender eyed him narrowly: "Ain't you goin' it a little
strong, pardner?" he asked.  The Texan stared at him as if he had not
heard, and answered nothing.  A smile bent the white aproned one's lips
as he glanced into his customer's eyes still black from the blow Curt
had dealt him in the coulee.

"Them lamps of yourn was turned up too high, wasn't they?" he asked.

The cowboy nodded, thoughtfully: "Yes, that's it.  They was turned up
too high--a damn sight too high for me, I reckon."

"Git bucked off?"

The blackened eyes narrowed ever so slightly: "No.  A guard done that."

"A guard?"

"Yes, a guard."  The Texan poured out his fifth drink.  "In the pen, it
was."

"In the pen!"  In há-_w_a-_w_á (awkward), the compound word ha-_w_ái
(water-pipe), and several others the w takes the _way_ sound.

The great majority of Hawaiian words are accented on the penult, and in
simple words of four or more syllables there is, as a rule, an accent
on the fourth and on the sixth syllables, counting back from the final
syllable, as in lá-na-kí-la (victorious) and as in hó-o-kó-lo-kó-lo (to
try at law).

_Aha_, (á-ha)--a braided cord of sinet; an assembly; a prayer or
religious service (note a, p. 20).
_Ahaaina_ (á-ha-ái-na)--a feast.
_Ai_ (ai, as in aisle)--vegetable food; to eat; an event in a game
or contest (p. 93).
_Ai-á-lo_ (to eat in the presence of)--the persons privileged to
eat at an alii's table."No.  He was a bar-keep over on the Marias.  He made the mistake of
takin' ondue notice of a pair of black eyes I'd got--somehow they
looked mirthful to him, an'--"  The Texan paused and gazed
reproachfully toward a flick of a white apron as the loquacious one
disappeared through the back door.

A loud shouting and a rattling of wheels sounded from without.  The
card game broke up, and the players slouched out the door.  Through the
window the Texan watched the stage pull up at the hotel, watched the
express box swung off, and the barn-dogs change the horses; saw the
exchange of pouches at the post office; saw the stage pull out slowly
and stop before a little white cottage next door to the steepleless
church.  Then he reached for the bottle, poured another drink, and
drank it very slowly.  Through the open door came the far-away rattle
of wheels.  He tossed some money onto the bar, walked to the door, and
stood gazing down the trail toward the cloud of grey dust that grew
dimmer and dimmer in the distance.  At last, it disappeared altogether,
and only the trail remained, winding like a great grey serpent toward
the distant black buttes of the Judith Range.  He started to re-enter
the saloon, paused with his foot on the threshold and stared down the
empty trail, then facing abruptly about he swung into the saddle,
turned his horse's head northward, and rode slowly out of town.  She
becomes ill, asks mother to prick her little finger. Mother does so
and child pops out. Child grows each time it is bathed. Girl refuses
to divulge name of child's father. Parents decide to celebrate
balaua and invite all people. Send out oiled betel-nuts covered with
gold to invite guests. When one refuses, nut begins to grow on his
knee or prized animal until invitation is accepted. Child is placed by
gate of town in hopes it will recognize its father. Gives no sign
until sun appears, then goes to it."My luck's runnin' mighty low," he muttered softly, and threw back his
shoulders, as his teeth gritted hard, "but I'm still in the game, an'
maybe this will change it."  Very carefully, very tenderly, he placed
the blossom beneath the band inside his hat.  "I must go an' hunt for
Bat, the old renegade!  If anything's happened to him--if that damned
Long Bill has laid for him--I will kill a man, sure enough."  He
gathered up his reins and rode on up the trail, and as he rode the
shadows lengthened.  Only once he paused and looked backward at the
little ugly white town.  Before him the trail dipped into a wide valley
and he rode on.  And, as the feet of his horse thudded softly in the
grey dust of the trail, the sound blended with the low, wailing chant
of the mournful dirge of the plains:

  "O bury me not on the lone prairie
  Where the wild coyotes will howl o'er me,
  Where the rattlesnakes hiss and the crow flies free,
  O bury me not on the lone prairie."
